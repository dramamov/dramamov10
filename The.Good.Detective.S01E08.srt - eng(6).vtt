00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:12.404
I grew up in my uncle's house after my father passed away.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.228
And my uncle held onto this watch.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.949
This is your uncle.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.113
What's going on?

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:23.704
You remember the watch that your father left behind when he passed, right?

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:24.716
Yes.

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:28.607
Did you take it when you were in high school?

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:30.129
No, I didn't.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.110
Jong Tae said that you took it from my study.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.974
Then are you saying that Jong Tae lied to me?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490
Fine, goodbye.

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:48.724
It was the first call I had received from my uncle since I left the house ten years ago.

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:53.120
November 6th, 2015. Four days after Yoon Ji Seon's body was found.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.555
That's when this call was recorded.

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:05.396
I think it got a lot smoother.

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:07.730
And the scent lingers longer too.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.894
Please tell your colleague thank you and that our sales went up.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.793
Mention my name if he says he's going to raise the price.

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:19.670
CEO Kim only got this big because I watched his back for him.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.327
If it weren't for me, he would still be selling rotten meat illegally.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.126

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:32.200
How would Hyeon Joo and I get through life if you weren't here?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.338
I feel the same way.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:40.325
Life would've been very difficult for me if I hadn't had you and Hyeon Joo.

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:47.685
Detective Kang came by earlier.

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.309
Why?

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:56.220
- Is that what Kang Do Chang asked?
- Tell me the truth.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.808
Did you tell him that you got it from me?

00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:00.833
I'm not going to send Hyeon Joo to study abroad with that kind of money.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.744
Imagine if she finds out later.

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:05.211
I'm going to tell her to just study here.

00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.402
I asked you if you told him.

00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:10.554
Did you tell Kang Do Chang?

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:13.915
Yes.

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:22.110
Do you know

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.090
why I chose a woman with a kid?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.494
It's because of Jin Soo.

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.271
Because I felt sorry.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.574
Because I felt so sorry for him.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.554
Yes.

00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:57.595
She told Kang Do Chang about it.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.364
She says she's going to testify in court too.

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:03.989
Move within the region of my jurisdiction if you can.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.212

The watch that you bought at the auction.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.816
Did you really pay 800M won (~$800,000) for it with your own money?

Yes.

The same goes for the rest of you guys.

We're a family because we risk our lives to protect each other.

But if one of us is holding up a knife against the family,

it means he is a traitor.

after playing sports in high school and not getting into a college?

00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:28.907
I joined a gang and worked under them while eating dog food.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.338
And on the first day I worked for them, the cops came for us.

00:07:32.338 --> 00:07:34.548
I ran for my life.

00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:37.340
Actually, I didn't run, I rolled.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.857
I got caught and fell immediately.

00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:42.670
The cop asked me, "How old are you?"

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.236
And I told him, "I'm 19."

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:48.196
Then the cop smiled and said, "Come back after you lose some weight."

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:52.612
He turned around to go, and there was a glow around him.

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:54.039
He looked so cool.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.021
Why are you telling me this─

00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:59.190
So I lost weight and became a detective. I got won over by that image.

We can rotate when I come back at 18:00 (06:00pm).

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:32.094
Prosecutor Jeong. Please use your power this once.

00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:35.112
Please talk to the auditor for me.

00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:36.943
I don't have much power.

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:40.061
Don't you remember Lee Dae Cheol's case from five years ago?

00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.174
I would've let him go if you hadn't ordered me not to.

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:47.319
Hey, Chief Moon, what are you talking about?

00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:50.222
You're the one who said we should bury that evidence.

00:12:50.222 --> 00:12:55.067
Why are you bringing that up now? You really know how to make something into a big deal.

00:12:55.932 --> 00:13:01.011
Okay, fine. Just make sure you keep your mouth shut.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.508
You're the one who said we should bury that evidence.

00:13:06.508 --> 00:13:11.016
Why are you bringing that up now? You really know how to make something into a big deal.

00:13:11.016 --> 00:13:15.141
Okay, fine. Just make sure you keep your mouth shut.

00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:16.099
Yes, sir.

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:23.058
I'll forget everything that happened between us back then.

00:13:23.058 --> 00:13:26.161
We'll definitely win the retrial if we release this.

00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.682
You'll win?

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:31.969
You'll win if Lee Dae Cheol is found to be innocent?

00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:34.103
No, not really.

00:13:34.103 --> 00:13:36.644
But it's definitive proof.

00:13:36.644 --> 00:13:37.697
These two,

00:13:37.697 --> 00:13:39.459
Moon Sang Beom, the head detective who was in charge of the investigation,

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:43.775
and Jeong Sang Il, the prosecutor who was in charge of the

00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:45.986
case back then and who is in charge of the retrial now.

00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:50.267
The police and prosecution created the case for Lee Dae Cheol five years ago.

00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.724
Where did you get the audio file from?

00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.400
I can't...

00:13:54.424 --> 00:13:57.924
Do you need to hide the source from your senior manager too?

00:14:00.877 --> 00:14:03.877
It's Kim Gi Tae, the former district attorney general.

00:14:06.063 --> 00:14:08.401
Okay. Write the article.

00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:10.056
Let's release it tomorrow.

00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:10.905
Okay.

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:14.158
But don't tell anyone about it before the article gets published.

00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:15.721
It has to be an exclusive from us.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:18.314
Don't leak the audio file to anyone else.

00:14:18.338 --> 00:14:19.838
Yes, sir.

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:03.799
Director, it's me, Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:08.191
There's something you need to take care of right away.

00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:13.025
Catching the real killer isn't our priority right now.

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:15.596
We first need to find the evidence the police manipulated

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:18.940
to frame Lee Dae Cheol.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.111
The biggest reason that Lee Dae Cheol became the suspect in Yoon Ji Seon's murder was

00:15:23.135 --> 00:15:27.591
because they found Yoon Ji Seon's hair in his delivery truck.

00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:31.353
Please check the truck's route and the times.

00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:35.295
So the route is as you said before?

00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:39.849
We have a witness who can testify that a deal was made between the real killer and the police.

00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:44.042
We need to make sure she's protected until the trial.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.690
This man...

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.660
Isn't this the guy who killed someone?

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.877
Yes, that's right.

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:05.575
All the residents were scared back then.

00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:09.780
They put up CCTV cameras at the entrance because of him.

00:16:11.268 --> 00:16:13.798
You really can't tell a book by its cover.

00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:18.456
I felt bad for him that he had to take his daughter in his truck with him.

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:20.795
He took his daughter in his truck with him?

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:22.928
Yes, she was in middle school.

00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:24.608
Her school was nearby.

00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:28.853
I heard he picked her up after school was over.

00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:37.556
[November 8, 2015, five days after Yoon Ji Seon's body was found]

00:17:07.768 --> 00:17:11.168
Dad! When are we going to eat?

00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:13.875
I'm hungry!

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.236
Why are you standing outside? It's cold.

00:17:34.783 --> 00:17:38.730
Do you remember the man that you saw?

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:44.691
Try to remember carefully. You're the only one who saw him.

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:49.308
I don't remember.

00:17:49.308 --> 00:17:53.408
Eun Hye, you have to remember his face.

00:17:53.408 --> 00:17:57.048
That's the only way we can set your father free.

00:17:57.048 --> 00:17:58.618
Ji Hyeok.

00:17:58.618 --> 00:18:01.314
You have to remember his face.

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:05.830
That's the only way we can make sure your father didn't die in vain.

00:18:07.095 --> 00:18:09.329
Please try to remember it.

00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:13.067
The outcome of today's trial depends on you.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.011
Hyeongnim, it's almost time.

00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:26.794
We should go.

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:32.409
Eun Hye, you have to remember it.

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:51.377
Senior Manager, where are you right now?

00:18:56.329 --> 00:18:57.529
What happened?

00:18:57.529 --> 00:19:00.702
Why was my article not published?

00:19:01.302 --> 00:19:04.631
Why... Why would you do this?

00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:07.630
You definitely told me to write the article last night!

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.480
It was decided during the editing meeting yesterday.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.544
Was it before I sent the article to you, or after?

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.683
It was already decided before I sent it to you, huh?

00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:21.687
You had no intention of releasing the article to begin with, huh?

00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:30.353
You said we write for those who have no power.

00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:33.861
When my father had no power,

00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:37.544
and nobody would listen to him...

00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:42.337
That's what you said to me when you wrote the article about my father.

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:44.430
So why?

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.687
Why would you do this?

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:54.389
Do you think I wrote that article because your father had no power?

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.533
It's because the group that your father belonged to

00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:00.394
was weak enough for me to go up against.

00:20:00.394 --> 00:20:03.096
But this is different. It's the police and the prosecution.

00:20:03.096 --> 00:20:07.077
They'll cut off their tails if the audio file gets released,

00:20:07.077 --> 00:20:09.518
but they won't forgive the one who went against them.

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.642
That's how they live.

00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:17.006
You think that alone would be enough to make Lee Dae Cheol win the retrial?

00:20:17.572 --> 00:20:20.626
The police and prosecution will try even harder to kill him.

00:20:20.626 --> 00:20:23.866
Not just Lee Dae Cheol, but everyone who stood by his side.

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:27.565
They'll do whatever they can to drag them to the very bottom of society.

00:20:27.565 --> 00:20:30.098
That includes you too.

00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:33.584
What if I want to take on those risks and reveal the truth no matter what?

00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:35.210
How will you do that?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.317
You have nowhere to publish your article.

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:46.884
Just forget that you heard it. That's how you can protect yourself.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.708
If I keep my mouth shut,

00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:54.596
it will burden me for the rest of my life.

00:20:55.674 --> 00:20:57.400
I take on that burden too.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.034
You're not the only one who is keeping their mouth shut.

00:21:17.447 --> 00:21:21.816
I met with the director in the morning.

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:24.031
We were talking about a couple of things,

00:21:24.031 --> 00:21:28.420
and I mentioned you to the director.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.539
Me?

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:33.652
I told him we got a pretty decent addition to our team.

00:21:33.652 --> 00:21:37.689
I asked him to remember the name Yoon Sang Mi.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.686
Thank you.

00:21:40.686 --> 00:21:42.592
But why?

00:21:43.455 --> 00:21:48.398
The director is paying attention to Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:21:48.398 --> 00:21:53.484
I heard you were on the team that was in charge of the case.

00:21:53.484 --> 00:21:54.821
Yes, that's right.

00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.825
Can you tell me what happened back then?

00:21:58.825 --> 00:22:03.728
Don't leave anything out. Tell me the truth about what happened.

00:22:03.728 --> 00:22:08.687
This will be a good opportunity for you to get on the director's good side.

00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:15.956
What's taking so long?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.494
Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon!

00:22:34.852 --> 00:22:37.067
Ms. Jeong! Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon!

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.283
Get out of the car!

00:22:38.283 --> 00:22:40.483
Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon!

00:22:40.483 --> 00:22:42.198
Get out the car!

00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:48.323
Ms. Jeong was in that car, right? Remember 4728.

00:23:08.477 --> 00:23:10.278
The witness isn't here yet.

00:23:10.278 --> 00:23:11.277
You can't reach her?

00:23:11.277 --> 00:23:14.444
I think you need to come up with plan B.

00:23:43.244 --> 00:23:44.844
Excuse me.

00:23:47.274 --> 00:23:48.974
That's...

00:23:48.974 --> 00:23:50.682
It's him. Check if she's inside.

00:23:50.682 --> 00:23:53.415
That's the one Detective Oh arrested.

00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:57.297
Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon?

00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:03.529
Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon, are you in there?

00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:06.368
Ms. Jeong Yoo Seon!

00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:08.571
Hey! Wait!

00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:10.628
Let's just talk!

00:24:10.628 --> 00:24:12.528
Damn it!

00:24:22.981 --> 00:24:28.396
Yeah, let's not tire each other out. Oh damn...

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.010
[Hana Mart]

00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:48.381
You're dead.

00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:03.568
Hey, come here.

00:25:10.045 --> 00:25:11.835
How embarrassing.

00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:13.842
What happened? Did you find them?

00:25:13.842 --> 00:25:16.645
Yes, we did, but...

00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:21.187
I think they switched her for someone else. She's not here.

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.506
Okay. Try to find her again.

00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:27.170
You have to make sure she doesn't get hurt.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.670
Got it?

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.970
Hyeon Joo's mother (Mrs. Jeong), are you all right?

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.994
Did something happen to you?

00:25:43.994 --> 00:25:48.204
I don't think I'll be able to come to court.

00:25:48.204 --> 00:25:51.607
You don't have to. You don't need to come.

00:25:52.292 --> 00:25:55.449
So you're okay? Nothing happened to you, right?

00:25:55.449 --> 00:25:57.058
No.

00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:01.944
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

00:26:01.944 --> 00:26:03.801
I hope you understand.

00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:07.407
I don't care what happens to me,

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:11.098
but Hyeon Joo...

00:26:11.926 --> 00:26:14.585
I think it would put Hyeon Joo in danger too.

00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.592
I'm really sorry, Detective Kang.

00:26:16.592 --> 00:26:19.623
It's all right.

00:26:19.623 --> 00:26:22.265
As long as you're okay.

00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:24.799
I asked for too big of a favor.

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:33.312
I won't ask you again, so just make sure you are okay, please.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.908
That's all I want.

00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:43.481
Okay. Goodbye.

00:27:02.332 --> 00:27:04.209
Come back when the retrial is over.

00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:08.998
I was supposed to die, wasn't I?

00:27:11.114 --> 00:27:12.647
Go board your plane.

00:27:12.647 --> 00:27:15.173
I won't be able to protect you if you don't.

00:27:35.552 --> 00:27:37.452
I will...

00:27:39.246 --> 00:27:41.381
I will...

00:27:43.803 --> 00:27:46.562
get you no matter what.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.818
You bastards.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.367
You remember this watch, right?

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:02.336
Yes.

00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:03.490
How do you know this watch?

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.866
I saw it at Ji Seon's studio.

00:28:05.866 --> 00:28:08.878
I found it after someone left it in the bathroom.

00:28:08.878 --> 00:28:11.288
To whom did Ms. Yoon Ji Seon say the watch belonged?

00:28:11.312 --> 00:28:13.390
Oh Jong Tae.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.390
[Drunk Driving Report - Oh Jong Tae ]

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.859
On the morning of November 3rd, 2015, the day the body was found,

00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:27.442
Oh Jong Tae was caught driving under the influence on Baeko Road in Incheon.

00:28:27.442 --> 00:28:29.664
He was moved to the station for an investigation.

00:28:29.664 --> 00:28:33.223
It's proof that the CCTV footage showing

00:28:33.223 --> 00:28:36.355
Oh Jong Tae at a hotel in Busan was fabricated.

00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:38.520
The place where he was stopped for a DUI

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.350
was 13 km away from where Yoon Ji Seon's body was found.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.361
It was about ten minutes away by car.

00:28:43.361 --> 00:28:49.651
At the time, the police gave him another ticket for crossing over the center line.

00:28:50.775 --> 00:28:52.732
You've crossed the center line.

00:28:52.732 --> 00:28:54.938
Please show me your license.

00:28:54.938 --> 00:28:59.990
Oh Jong Tae had tried to go back to the site where the body had been disposed of.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:06.661
The reason Oh Jong Tae tried to go back to the site was because of this watch.

00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:11.186
He had realized that he had dropped his watch at the site.

00:29:11.186 --> 00:29:14.976
So, was that watch found at the crime scene?

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:17.562
Yes. Your Honor, I'm sure it was.

00:29:17.562 --> 00:29:21.779
But someone takes this watch.

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:26.523
The person discovers the watch belongs to Oh Jong Tae and makes a deal with him.

00:29:26.523 --> 00:29:30.621
How does this prove that the watch belonged to Oh Jong Tae?

00:29:30.621 --> 00:29:35.517
This watch is a luxury brand, of which only two exist in Korea.

00:29:35.517 --> 00:29:38.740
There's only one place in Korea where this watch can be repaired.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.732
If you visit the repair shop, you can easily find out who this watch belonged to.

00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:47.397
I'm sure the person who found this watch at the crime scene also had the same thought.

00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:51.197
Who checked for that information at the time?

00:29:51.197 --> 00:29:55.574
It was Detective Nam Gook Hyeon from Incheon's West Police Department violent crimes team.

00:29:59.083 --> 00:30:00.853
Your Honor!

00:30:00.853 --> 00:30:02.237
Go ahead.

00:30:02.237 --> 00:30:08.999
Do you have a witness or evidence that will prove that Detective Nam had the watch?

00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:15.493
We don't have one yet.

00:30:15.493 --> 00:30:22.372
So you're saying we can only base it on the repair man's memory from five years ago.

00:30:22.372 --> 00:30:25.599
How old is the repairman?

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:28.416
He's 75 years old.

00:30:28.416 --> 00:30:30.220
No further questions.

00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:45.185
The biggest evidence that got the defendant arrested for Yoon Ji Seon's murder

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:49.780
was the victim's hair that was found in the defendant's delivery truck.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.960
The hair was found five days after the body was found.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.526
But we've confirmed with the delivery company that the

00:30:58.526 --> 00:31:02.015
defendant's truck was cleaned three days after the body was found.

00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:06.260
So that means the hair remained inside the truck even after the cleaning.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.759
But the cleaning includes water cleaning.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:17.232
Why do you think the hair was the only thing that didn't get swept away by the water?

00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:18.720
Witness,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.994
you said you rode in your father's truck after your school ended, right?

00:31:22.994 --> 00:31:24.232
Yes.

00:31:24.232 --> 00:31:29.794
You said you heard someone open and close the back of the truck while your father was making a delivery, right?

00:31:29.794 --> 00:31:30.589
Yes.

00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:33.935
And you went outside to check because you thought it was your father,

00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:37.083
but it wasn't your father. Is that correct?

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.670
Yes.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.061
Do you remember that man's face?

00:31:51.082 --> 00:31:54.815
I remember that he was wearing a hat and jeans.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:57.570
Okay.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.475
It would be difficult to remember someone

00:31:59.475 --> 00:32:02.530
you briefly saw five years ago when you were just a 7th grader.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.834
However, if you were to see that man again,

00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:09.834
you would remember him.

00:32:15.544 --> 00:32:18.297
You're the detective who's in charge of Yoon Ji Seon's murder case, right?

00:32:18.297 --> 00:32:20.402
Did you find out who the killer is?

00:32:20.402 --> 00:32:23.136
I'm sorry, we don't have anything yet.

00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:31.179
This is news footage of Detective Nam, who was in charge of the case back then.

00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:33.187
He's wearing a hat and jeans.

00:32:33.187 --> 00:32:36.368
If this is the man who opened and closed the back of the delivery truck,

00:32:36.368 --> 00:32:39.025
that means the evidence was set up.

00:32:43.001 --> 00:32:44.501
Witness.

00:32:45.057 --> 00:32:46.983
Do you remember him?

00:32:49.523 --> 00:32:52.423
Try to remember. It's him, right?

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.740
Turn your head to the left, so it shows your face.

00:32:59.699 --> 00:33:01.527
Ji Hyeok, please.

00:33:01.527 --> 00:33:04.401
That's the man who stabbed your dad, right?

00:33:05.365 --> 00:33:07.765
Ji Hyeok. It must be him.

00:33:07.765 --> 00:33:10.054
Just say that it's him.

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:14.226
You just can't remember because you were in shock at the time.

00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:18.616
I'm sure it's him! Please say that it's him!

00:33:49.413 --> 00:33:50.613
Witness.

00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:52.228
You remember, right?

00:33:52.228 --> 00:33:54.332
Is that him?

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.380
Your Honor.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.213
Lawyer So, don't force the witness to answer.

00:34:06.826 --> 00:34:08.703
I'm not sure.

00:34:08.703 --> 00:34:11.841
I can't remember. I'm sorry.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.600
- No worries, it's fine.
- Dad.

00:34:22.608 --> 00:34:24.300
It's okay.

00:34:36.954 --> 00:34:39.332
I messed up, right?

00:34:39.332 --> 00:34:43.957
I should've just said that it was him, right?

00:34:45.454 --> 00:34:48.154
You're not supposed to lie in court.

00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:51.313
Today's trial went pretty well.

00:34:51.313 --> 00:34:53.472
It will be okay.

00:35:09.903 --> 00:35:13.811
You think that alone would be enough to make Lee Dae Cheol win the retrial?

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:17.192
The police and prosecution will try even harder to kill him.

00:35:17.192 --> 00:35:20.623
Not just Lee Dae Cheol, but everyone who stood by his side.

00:35:20.623 --> 00:35:23.426
They'll drag them to the very bottom of society.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.740
[Entrance to Court Number 1]

00:35:41.626 --> 00:35:45.799
Can you understand what Kang Do Chang is doing?

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:51.160
Who will report crimes to the police if Lee Dae Cheol's ruling gets flipped?

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.250
Right?

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.532
So, why would someone who has been an officer for 18 years do this?

00:35:55.532 --> 00:35:56.822
I don't get it.

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:59.459
How can I help you, Prosecutor?

00:35:59.459 --> 00:36:01.287
Didn't the director tell you?

00:36:01.287 --> 00:36:06.612
I just heard that I should meet with you.

00:36:07.406 --> 00:36:13.431
The director called me and gave me a heads-up.

00:36:13.431 --> 00:36:17.061
He said you'll be considered for a special promotion soon,

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.546
for protecting the police's honor.

00:36:23.574 --> 00:36:26.375
I should've called to say congratulations.

00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:28.826
But I'm restricted on how many calls I can make.

00:36:28.826 --> 00:36:32.173
It's late, but please tell your brother that I'm sincerely happy for him.

00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:34.180
You sent a file to Reporter Jin, right?

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.015
Me? What file?

00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:37.762
What is it that you want?

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.001
What do you mean?

00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:42.420
Just getting out of here I guess.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.611
That's the only thing.

00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:47.332
- So that's it?
- But I'm not getting my hopes up.

00:36:47.332 --> 00:36:49.853
I'm not on the best terms with the new attorney general.

00:36:49.853 --> 00:36:53.598
You know that your brother doesn't like me.

00:36:56.104 --> 00:36:58.104
Gi Tae Hyeong.

00:36:58.104 --> 00:36:58.959
What?

00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:01.759
You've opened a Pandora's box.

00:37:01.759 --> 00:37:05.209
I'm going to close that box,

00:37:05.209 --> 00:37:07.627
so that hope stays in there.

00:37:07.627 --> 00:37:10.702
But I will leave it slightly ajar,

00:37:11.407 --> 00:37:13.672
so that it stays alive.

00:37:15.097 --> 00:37:19.190
You were just a tiny rascal who didn't know anything when you were little.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.065
But now you know how the world works.

00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:25.879
You know how to use the carrot and stick approach.

00:37:37.842 --> 00:37:39.966
It's an emergency.

00:37:55.434 --> 00:37:56.545
Detective Oh.

00:37:56.545 --> 00:37:58.045
Yes?

00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:02.571
You accept bribery a lot, huh?

00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:04.490
Me?

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.409
I don't think so.

00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:08.510
How can you keep paying for drinks like this with a detective's salary?

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.077
I bet you accept a lot of crap money.

00:38:12.077 --> 00:38:15.759
That's a poor choice of words for a reporter.

00:38:15.759 --> 00:38:17.359
What did the lawyer say?

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:19.469
- Does he think we'll win this case?
- Yes.

00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:24.136
Well, the prosecutor is an idiot, so he might do something crazy.

00:38:24.136 --> 00:38:26.334
But we're not going to win.

00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:29.972
Lee Dae Cheol and his daughter are both too nice.

00:38:29.972 --> 00:38:33.542
They need to be less nice. How the hell are they going to win this case like that?

00:38:33.542 --> 00:38:36.626
Not all nice people lose.

00:38:36.626 --> 00:38:40.553
Detective Kang will testify at the next trial.

00:38:40.553 --> 00:38:42.440
Then we'll have a chance at winning.

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:46.645
Who do you think we're up against?

00:38:46.645 --> 00:38:48.287
Prosecutor Jeong?

00:38:48.287 --> 00:38:49.754
Team Leader Nam Gook Hyeon?

00:38:49.754 --> 00:38:51.901
Or Oh Jong Tae?

00:38:51.901 --> 00:38:55.576
Why? Did you get some new evidence?

00:38:55.576 --> 00:38:57.062
It's nothing.

00:38:57.845 --> 00:38:58.769
It's nothing.

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:01.536
Then why would you ask me that?

00:39:02.817 --> 00:39:06.017
Don't all people care most about their own lives?

00:39:10.375 --> 00:39:13.091
Do you like being a detective?

00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:14.234
Yes.

00:39:14.234 --> 00:39:17.202
Then you should thank me.

00:39:17.202 --> 00:39:21.636
You should thank me for letting you keep your job. Come on.

00:39:22.668 --> 00:39:26.472
Come on. I like being a reporter too.

00:39:26.472 --> 00:39:30.011
I want to keep my job as a reporter too.

00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:33.095
So just say thank you.

00:39:33.095 --> 00:39:34.576
Come on.

00:39:34.576 --> 00:39:37.540
I need to know why I should thank you.

00:39:44.763 --> 00:39:46.563
Later...

00:39:47.394 --> 00:39:50.261
You'll end up bowing to me and thanking me.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.442
I'm sure.

00:39:59.622 --> 00:40:02.131
I do care about my life.

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:10.297
But there are also times when other people's lives decide the fate of my life.

00:40:33.663 --> 00:40:35.294
Try to remember it carefully.

00:40:35.294 --> 00:40:36.725
You're the only one who saw him.

00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:39.525
You remember, right? Is that him?

00:40:39.525 --> 00:40:42.285
I can't remember. I'm sorry.

00:40:42.285 --> 00:40:44.320
It's okay.

00:40:58.628 --> 00:41:00.528
Mr. Lee Dae Cheol.

00:41:01.112 --> 00:41:02.071
Yes, Prosecutor.

00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:05.150
You think this is unfair, huh?

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:08.686
You killed Yoon Ji Seon, right? Just admit it.

00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:13.588
No. I didn't kill her.

00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:14.909
Then what about Detective Jang Jin Soo?

00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:18.231
Of course not. I didn't kill Yoon Ji Seon, so why would I...

00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:20.223
Why would I kill the detective?

00:41:20.223 --> 00:41:22.250
You do have a reason.

00:41:23.023 --> 00:41:23.761
Excuse me?

00:41:23.761 --> 00:41:28.516
A detective kept saying you killed someone that you didn't kill.

00:41:28.516 --> 00:41:32.044
So you could've gotten mad and killed him.

00:41:32.044 --> 00:41:33.782
Think about it carefully.

00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:37.119
Accidental murder doesn't get the maximum sentence.

00:41:40.335 --> 00:41:45.393
By the way, a trial always results in a winner and loser.

00:41:45.393 --> 00:41:49.596
But sometimes both sides win.

00:41:49.596 --> 00:41:51.186
Please come on in.

00:41:52.786 --> 00:41:54.653
I'll see you in court.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.010
[Kang Do Chang | Police ID]

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.785
What are you doing sitting here?

00:42:49.785 --> 00:42:51.662
You see,

00:42:51.662 --> 00:42:55.135
Detective Kang wasn't feeling well, so I took his spot.

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:58.875
Where is Kang Do Chang right now?

00:43:05.565 --> 00:43:07.465
Yes?

00:43:08.969 --> 00:43:10.878
You can fire me.

00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:15.293
You can fire me if you want, Chief.

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:18.059
What?

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:21.107
No, you're the wrong one.

00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:23.225
I'm doing the right thing.

00:43:23.225 --> 00:43:26.415
I'm the one who's doing the right thing.

00:43:27.314 --> 00:43:28.714
What?

00:43:30.416 --> 00:43:33.066
You're the one who's ruining the police's reputation,

00:43:33.066 --> 00:43:35.796
you piece of trash!

00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:38.133
Bastard.

00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:40.418
Oppa.

00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:43.229
Don't quit your job.

00:43:43.229 --> 00:43:45.229
Don't worry.

00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:49.908
I can still provide for you even if I quit.

00:43:50.457 --> 00:43:52.172
Oppa.

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.278
You...

00:43:57.284 --> 00:44:01.390
are someone who only knows how to be a detective.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.236
Think about it carefully.

00:44:03.236 --> 00:44:06.866
What else do you have left if you lose your detective title?

00:44:23.018 --> 00:44:27.994
I'm Detective Kang Do Chang from Incheon West Division, Violent Crimes Team 2.

00:44:27.994 --> 00:44:29.418
Witness.

00:44:29.418 --> 00:44:32.309
How do you know the defendant?

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:36.259
My colleagues, Detective Jang Jin Soo and Detective Nam Gook Hyeon,

00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:40.188
were investigating Yoon Ji Seon's murder.

00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:43.178
When Detective Jang Jin Soo was murdered during the investigation,

00:44:43.178 --> 00:44:46.732
I was put in charge of the case and closed it.

00:44:46.732 --> 00:44:51.265
At the time, were you confident that Lee Dae Cheol was the killer?

00:44:51.265 --> 00:44:52.261
Yes.

00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:53.971
How about now?

00:44:55.418 --> 00:45:02.513
Detective Jang was my colleague and also my friend.

00:45:03.165 --> 00:45:05.999
He was the best detective.

00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:09.183
I was so angry that I lost my rationality at the time.

00:45:09.183 --> 00:45:12.930
I had to catch the killer no matter what.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.835
I had to get the confession no matter what.

00:45:15.835 --> 00:45:17.695
So,

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.869
I pressured Lee Dae Cheol.

00:45:22.869 --> 00:45:29.857
I just accepted the evidence that I was handed without checking it first.

00:45:29.857 --> 00:45:35.865
I was only focused on catching the killer.

00:45:36.516 --> 00:45:39.350
So you admit that you didn't conduct a proper investigation

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.595
because you became irrational over your colleague's death.

00:45:43.595 --> 00:45:44.914
Yes, that's right.

00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:46.810
Witness, let me ask you again.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.990
Do you still believe that the defendant is the real killer at this moment?

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.671
No.

00:45:56.394 --> 00:46:00.180
Do you admit that the investigation was poorly conducted and also used coercion?

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.504
Yes.

00:46:01.504 --> 00:46:06.580
The defendant was found guilty at the time because of the evidence.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.978
How would you explain the evidence?

00:46:09.978 --> 00:46:14.868
I found a murder weapon that was suspected to have been used

00:46:14.868 --> 00:46:18.200
to kill Detective Jang near the crime scene.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.142
And you found the defendant's DNA from that murder weapon?

00:46:21.142 --> 00:46:22.466
Yes.

00:46:22.466 --> 00:46:28.213
But we had an incident before we turned it over to the crime lab.

00:46:28.213 --> 00:46:29.531
What kind of incident?

00:46:29.531 --> 00:46:35.988
We lost the murder weapon for about one hour.

00:46:35.988 --> 00:46:40.752
So that means there was a chance that the murder weapon was tampered with.

00:46:40.752 --> 00:46:41.458
Yes.

00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:44.691
Why didn't you report this back then?

00:46:46.685 --> 00:46:51.360
I hid it because I thought that the mistake

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.636
could allow him to be found not guilty.

00:46:55.636 --> 00:46:58.536
Who was the person who lost the murder weapon?

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.100
It was me.

00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:10.270
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:13.458
Prosecutor, your witness.

00:47:15.261 --> 00:47:19.395
The defendant was sentenced to death at the final trial.

00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:24.165
If you had felt guilty about Lee Dae Cheol's sentencing,

00:47:24.165 --> 00:47:28.433
shouldn't you have said all of this back then?

00:47:28.433 --> 00:47:29.787
Why are you saying them now?

00:47:29.787 --> 00:47:33.412
At the time, I believed that I didn't do anything wrong.

00:47:33.412 --> 00:47:38.370
But now I believe that I did do something wrong.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:43.716
Witness. You have just admitted to committing professional negligence.

00:47:43.716 --> 00:47:47.019
No one would've found out about it if you had kept silent.

00:47:47.019 --> 00:47:52.103
Why are you saying it even when you know the consequences that will follow?

00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:55.657
What I will receive are just criticism and punishment.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:02.390
But it would be a matter of life or death for someone else.

00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:08.660
You're so compassionate.

00:48:30.224 --> 00:48:34.214
Witness, you were on the same team as Detective Kang Do Chang

00:48:34.214 --> 00:48:37.069
during Lee Dae Cheol's investigation five years ago, right?

00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:39.684
Yes, he was my superior.

00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:43.869
So he was your colleague but also like a mentor.

00:48:43.869 --> 00:48:46.093
- Right?
- Yes.

00:48:46.093 --> 00:48:49.737
What was Detective Kang like back then?

00:48:49.737 --> 00:48:53.712
He was a very compassionate man as a mentor and as a human being.

00:48:53.712 --> 00:48:57.480
He treated not just his colleagues, but also the suspects

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.240
as human beings.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.608
Even if the suspect was arrested for murder?

00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:07.986
"Hate the crime, not the criminal."

00:49:07.986 --> 00:49:09.969
He would say that all the time.

00:49:09.969 --> 00:49:11.293
Objection, Your Honor!

00:49:11.293 --> 00:49:14.596
This trial is about the defendant, Lee Dae Cheol.

00:49:14.596 --> 00:49:16.775
It has nothing to do with the witness' character.

00:49:16.775 --> 00:49:20.182
Detective Kang was in charge of the investigation.

00:49:20.182 --> 00:49:21.740
It's not irrelevant.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.856
Prosecutor, please continue.

00:49:23.856 --> 00:49:28.729
Detective Kang testified that the police had lost the murder weapon during the investigation.

00:49:28.729 --> 00:49:30.550
Is that true?

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.067
Yes.

00:49:32.067 --> 00:49:34.397
It is true that the murder weapon went missing.

00:49:34.397 --> 00:49:39.822
Is it also true that Kang Do Chang is the one who lost it?

00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:44.625
No.

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:47.256
I'm the one who lost it.

00:49:48.999 --> 00:49:54.008
Then why do you think Kang Do Chang lied about it?

00:49:54.008 --> 00:49:56.605
It was to hide his junior's mistake.

00:49:56.605 --> 00:50:02.268
At the time, he went to every person who knew about me losing the evidence

00:50:02.268 --> 00:50:05.617
and asked them to not tell anyone about my mistake.

00:50:05.617 --> 00:50:08.183
Detective Kang talked about the possibility of

00:50:08.183 --> 00:50:10.491
evidence manipulation because it had gone missing.

00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:12.750
- Do you agree with him?
- No,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:16.931
I had just forgotten that I had put it in my trunk.

00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:21.637
There was no possibility of it going missing because it was in my trunk.

00:50:25.201 --> 00:50:27.264
Yoon Sang Mi.

00:50:27.934 --> 00:50:32.142
Lee Dae Cheol's daughter, Lee Eun Hye, had gone missing recently.

00:50:32.142 --> 00:50:35.797
It was concluded that Lee Eun Hye and Park Geon Ho had set the whole thing up.

00:50:35.797 --> 00:50:40.321
And that's when Kang Do Chang met with Lee Dae Cheol's daughter.

00:50:40.321 --> 00:50:43.798
She was a runaway working in the streets.

00:50:43.798 --> 00:50:48.860
Kang Do Chang is a very compassionate man

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.150
who would cover for his juniors' mistakes!

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:55.446
And he felt guilty that Lee Dae Cheol's daughter had

00:50:55.446 --> 00:50:59.932
ended up like that after he had arrested her father!

00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:01.813
And I'm sure Lee Dae Cheol's daughter pleaded

00:51:01.813 --> 00:51:04.535
with him saying that her father was innocent!

00:51:04.535 --> 00:51:06.004
I'm sure it shook him.

00:51:06.004 --> 00:51:11.714
Since he's a detective whose compassionate emotions come before rationality.

00:51:11.714 --> 00:51:13.473
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:51:14.216 --> 00:51:16.116
Yoon Sang Mi.

00:51:16.116 --> 00:51:19.531
Chief Moon is the one who recovered the murder weapon.

00:51:19.531 --> 00:51:22.737
Why are you lying?

00:51:22.737 --> 00:51:25.901
You're mistaken.

00:51:26.453 --> 00:51:28.011
Witness!

00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:31.508
This is not a place where you can have a private conversation.

00:51:31.508 --> 00:51:36.105
We will be the ones who will judge whether you two have committed perjury.

00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:45.734
Think about it carefully.

00:51:45.734 --> 00:51:48.243
Accidental murder doesn't get the maximum sentence.

00:51:48.243 --> 00:51:52.666
But sometimes both sides win.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.407
Your Honor,

00:51:58.407 --> 00:52:01.075
please give me a chance to testify too.

00:52:01.075 --> 00:52:02.785
Go ahead.

00:52:17.166 --> 00:52:19.722
I didn't kill Yoon Ji Seon.

00:52:19.722 --> 00:52:23.362
But I did kill

00:52:23.875 --> 00:52:26.184
Detective Jang Jin Soo.

00:52:30.805 --> 00:52:34.365
He kept trying to frame me for the murder, so I got upset.

00:52:34.365 --> 00:52:36.237
It was really accidental.

00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:39.312
How would I kill a detective?

00:52:39.312 --> 00:52:42.665
How could I possibly plot to kill a detective?

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:48.176
- Your Honor.
- Go ahead.

00:52:54.697 --> 00:52:56.597
- Defendant.
- Yes.

00:52:56.597 --> 00:53:01.178
Didn't you suggest this deal to me five years ago?

00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:05.059
You asked me to say that you only killed Detective Jang.

00:53:05.802 --> 00:53:09.881
You said you would admit to the murder in court if I did that.

00:53:09.881 --> 00:53:12.540
- Prosecutor.
- Back then I told you

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.768
that this kind of trick will never work.

00:53:14.768 --> 00:53:18.436
It would insult the sacred court!

00:53:18.436 --> 00:53:21.523
That's exactly what I told you back then!

00:54:03.232 --> 00:54:06.866
They made a final decision, right? How did it go?

00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:12.881
It was going to go this way no matter what.

00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:15.272
It's not anyone's fault.

00:54:16.528 --> 00:54:18.661
It's not anyone's fault...

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.818
[Death row inmate Lee Dae Cheol's charges confirmed. Execution to proceed as planned]

00:54:44.988 --> 00:54:46.588
Reporter Jin.

00:54:48.242 --> 00:54:49.942
Good work.

00:55:03.351 --> 00:55:06.518
It was a trial we could've won.

00:55:06.518 --> 00:55:10.475
I got too greedy at the end like an idiot.

00:55:12.755 --> 00:55:14.360
It's all my fault.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.855
What's your fault?

00:55:18.395 --> 00:55:20.728
You didn't do anything wrong,

00:55:20.728 --> 00:55:23.027
you idiot.

00:55:24.622 --> 00:55:27.055
You did nothing wrong.

00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:30.782
You're innocent.

00:55:33.266 --> 00:55:36.153
All I wanted was one thing.

00:55:36.153 --> 00:55:41.498
I just wanted at least one person to believe me.

00:55:41.498 --> 00:55:46.344
That's all I wanted.

00:55:48.314 --> 00:55:51.097
And that goal was exceeded.

But Eun Hye...

Eun Hye knows too.

That's all that matters.

00:56:03.173 --> 00:56:05.373
That's all that matters.

00:56:27.846 --> 00:56:30.652
Dae Cheol...

00:56:33.411 --> 00:56:35.266
Dae Cheol...

00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:43.095
I'm sorry.

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.900
You're going to walk Eun Hye

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.200
down the aisle when she gets married, right?

00:56:52.801 --> 00:56:54.684
I'm sorry.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.900
I'll leave now.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.653
Hyeongnim.

00:57:33.879 --> 00:57:35.746
Hurry up, Lee Dae Cheol.

00:57:35.746 --> 00:57:37.549
Just keep going straight.

00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:38.831
You can do it.

00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:41.703
Come on. Let's walk together.

00:57:48.447 --> 00:57:50.547
Get up.

00:57:50.547 --> 00:57:52.713
Get up, Lee Dae Cheol.

00:57:52.713 --> 00:57:55.230
You can go like a man.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.309
Eun Hye.

00:59:48.401 --> 00:59:51.793
Don't sell it this time. Just wear it well.

00:59:52.917 --> 00:59:55.750
It will make you look different.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.411
All right then.

00:59:58.411 --> 01:00:02.716
We won't have a reason to see each other again, right?

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.630
Of course.

01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:24.656
I just have one question.

01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:29.611
I know who killed Yoon Ji Seon,

01:00:35.204 --> 01:00:41.171
but who killed Detective Jang Jin Soo?

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:59.666
[Lee Dae Cheol]

01:01:07.578 --> 01:01:09.227
Let's go now.

01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:11.065
A little bit more.

01:01:11.933 --> 01:01:13.428
I want to stay here a bit longer.

01:01:13.428 --> 01:01:15.649
I'll wait for you outside.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.120

~ Preview ~
You should lie real low if you want to keep that uniform on.

01:02:00.413 --> 01:02:04.637
Let me keep my detective badge. There's something I need to do.

01:02:06.482 --> 01:02:08.848
We didn't get assigned to any cases today either?

01:02:08.848 --> 01:02:10.904
Look at you guys.

01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:14.140
Do you know Detective Oh Ji Hyeok? He worries me a little.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.363
There's something I have to see.

01:02:15.363 --> 01:02:17.246
I need to see you cry tears of blood.

01:02:17.246 --> 01:02:18.768
You look like a really nice girl.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.217
Do you know Detective Oh Ji Hyeok?

01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:22.190
Did you help Oh Jong Tae?

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.423
I have no reason to do that.

01:02:23.423 --> 01:02:26.862
Senior Manager already knew about the recording before this.

01:02:26.862 --> 01:02:29.215
Why did you do that? Why?

01:02:29.215 --> 01:02:33.814
Just admit it. Right now, you're wrong, and I'm right.
