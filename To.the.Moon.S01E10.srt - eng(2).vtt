00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.370
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.670
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.840
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.410
What is it? What's wrong?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.050
Look at this...

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060
(Enderion minus 30.01 percent)

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.830
(Episode 10: Our Share)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.540
Following the cyber hacking incident
at Equalus Cryptocurrency Exchange,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.870
investor sentiment has
cooled dramatically.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010
As major cryptocurrencies
continue their downward trend,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.710
Enderion has also taken a downturn.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.180
In just a few days, Enderion has
plummeted by nearly 30 percent.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.080
- It went up!
- What?

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.750
- It did?
- Really?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.190
The cost of living went up again.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.860
Darn it.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.690
Darn it, it dropped.
That girl, I swear.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.930
- It's up.
- Really?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.530
How much?

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.800
My body fat is up from last year.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.830
Why you...

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.500
It dropped again.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.140
It's up.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480
- How much?
- It went up?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Your daily fortune.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.220
Hey. You're doing that on purpose,
aren't you?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.790
Come on. Crypto is 70 percent luck
and 30 percent skill.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.920
At this point,
we might as well check our fortunes.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.220
What's your zodiac sign?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860
The Dragon.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.760
Let's see, Dragon...

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.530
Here it is.
"Misfortunes never come alone."

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.900
Sounds like a good one, right?

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.900
"Even if you fall backward,
you'll break your nose..."

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Let's just eat.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Why you...

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.610
Eun Sang.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.310
- Shouldn't we just pull out?
- What?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.250
Come on.
It's already dropped by 30 percent.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.750
She's right.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.180
It has been
dropping for a few days now.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.650
Are you crazy?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520
We'd be fools if we pulled out now.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.260
What if it drops even more?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.890
Sometimes you just have to
ride out the storm.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.260
If you worry about the day-to-day,
you'll never make the big bucks.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.240
So let's just hold steady
and see this through, okay?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.310
Let's talk about something else.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Anyone have some good news?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840
Right. Don't you have
anything interesting to share?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.780
You got nothing?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.020
So you're finally letting me
join the conversation?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.890
Now that the mood
has gotten this awkward?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.460
Fine, you're in.
Go ahead, say literally anything.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.690
What is there to say...

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.600
Autumn will be here soon,
and the leaves will be falling.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.730
Anything but things falling.
Talk about something else.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.700
Da Hae,
your button is about to fall off.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.310
I heard you were
quitting the company.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.340
Is that true?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.280
That's just a rumor.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.310
Why would Dr. Ham quit a job
that's going so well?

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.180
He can make 500,000 dollars
in bonuses just for showing up.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.750
You keep throwing around
"500,000 dollars..."

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.950
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.320
It's 600,000 dollars.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.290
How annoying.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.690
- What a turn-off.
- Stop saying "drop!"

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.030
Thank you for the meal.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.400
Thank you.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Gosh, I'm stuffed.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.040
We could've just split the bill.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.370
Those who got all worked up,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.380
demanding to know
who ate the pricey stir-fry...

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.140
when we were about
to split the bill,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.880
shouldn't be complaining. Right?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.020
Our finances were a little tight
for a fancy dish like that.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590
- Why? Is something wrong?
- It's just that...

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.520
The crypto market has been
tanking lately.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.190
So everyone's been on edge.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.560
- I thought it was serious.
- "Something serious?"

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.670
This might not be a big deal to you,
Dr. Ham.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.170
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I'm getting chocolate.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.210
Right.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.180
Are you sure everything is
all right with you?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680
That whole thing
about you quitting...

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.450
Hoppang Bite was just talking
nonsense, right?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.580
How many times must I tell you?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.720
Workers talk about lunch
or quitting.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.490
You shouldn't get worked up
over every little rumor.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.430
Okay, fine then.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.090
So...

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.830
about Jung Da Hee.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.570
What's she like?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.100
Da Hee?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940
Why?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.840
What? No reason.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.440
What? With Da Hee?

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.080
- Do what with her?
- The snack subscription box.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.480
The launch deadline is tight,
so you'll need someone to help you.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.050
So I want you and Da Hee
to work together on it.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.420
What do you say?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.560
Yes.
I'll do my best to help, Da Hee.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
Oh...

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.530
Okay.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.510
Mr. Ko said you needed help,
so I volunteered.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.040
You must be thrown off
by my arrival.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.850
No, not at all.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.080
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.450
Okay.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.820
Oh, about that letter...

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.190
The letter?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.420
I mentioned it only to you...

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.990
that I'd put a letter
in your locker.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600
About that...

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.230
I'm sorry.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.040
- What for?
- The thing is, about that letter...

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.100
I'm the one who took it.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.110
You did?

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.770
Yes.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.150
But can we leave it
at that for today?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.280
I have my reasons,
which I can't explain just yet.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.750
This must be a big shock for you.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.850
No. I wasn't trying
to interrogate you or anything.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.190
I'm sorry.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.960
But to be honest,
I was a little surprised too.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.730
I took the envelope,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.460
but it was just an empty envelope.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.070
The letter itself was gone.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.640
I threw it away.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.340
- You what?
- It was an accident.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.180
I feel so terrible, I'm so sorry.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.950
Don't worry about it.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
But still...

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.750
Are you busy, Da Hee?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.290
Let me buy you a meal,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.890
or at least a coffee.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.590
I feel too guilty
leaving it like this.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.760
And I'm worried you might get
the wrong idea about me.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.100
No, not at all.
There's nothing to misunderstand.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.070
I actually have plans today.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.970
Let's get coffee another time.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320
(Notice on Interim
Severance Pay Application)

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.330
Looks like applications are open
for severance pay.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400
Yes.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.970
On the 73rd National Liberation Day,
President Moon Jae In...

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.680
stated true liberation means peace
on the Korean Peninsula.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.550
You're struggling as is
and have another mouth to feed.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.380
Why would you make
side dishes for me?

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.290
Your dad just eats the leftovers.
Don't worry about it.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.390
Hey, I'm fine with leftovers.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.530
How's your back?

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.130
Gosh, my back's a little sore
from lying down all the time.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.560
I was asking Mom.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.270
Oh, I shouldn't have spoken.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.640
It's the same as usual.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.940
It actually feels better
when I move around,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.540
and it's a lot easier to walk.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.280
But you can't exactly move around
when you're driving all day.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.150
She won't be doing that much longer.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.350
- Her boss wants her to retire...
- Will you be quiet?

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.420
What's going on?

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.250
Mom, are you retiring?

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.790
No.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.030
- Just eat your apple.
- Seriously, are you retiring?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.090
No,

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.530
they reduced the number
of bus routes,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.000
so management asked...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.930
if I'd be willing
to take some time off.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.670
They were just testing the waters.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.510
- What? Isn't that the same thing?
- I said no, it's not like that.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640
Besides,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.440
if I retire, I have no intention
of depending on you.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.750
Who's worried about that?

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.020
Then stop making that face
and eat your apple. Okay?

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.120
- You have some too, Mom.
- Of course I will.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.790
Why are you eating the bruised spot?

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.660
It's fine. I'll cut the bruise out.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.730
Darn it.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.730
You should be
cutting something else out.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.270
Gosh, I don't get why
people even eat apples.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.350
(Enderion)

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.660
Darn it,
should I really just sell now?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.190
I should salvage what I can
for Mom's living expenses.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.960
But everyone said I'd be a fool
to sell now.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.200
Maybe if I put in a little more
at this price...

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.310
What?

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.040
Only a ship that weathers the storm
can reach the farthest seas.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.550
Unwavering faith brings
a great reward.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.380
- Da Hae, that's your horoscope
- What is this?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.380
for the month.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.420
Of all the times,
she has to send this.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.690
Fine.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.560
Why should my mom eat bruised fruit?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
Okay.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.270
All right. Let's do this.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.070
I'll cash out my severance pay
and put it into crypto.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.210
(I'll cash out my severance pay
and put it into crypto.)

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.510
Hi.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.350
I was told my severance pay
came through.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.890
I'm Jung Da Hae
from the Marketing Team.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.190
Yes.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.030
First, could you please sign
the confirmation form?

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.600
Sure.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.730
(Severance Pay
Acknowledgment of Receipt)

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.330
By the way, are you and Eun Sang
doing something together?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.340
Eun Sang? Why do you ask?

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.970
Ms. Eun Sang just collected...

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.270
her severance pay
a little while ago.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.080
And now you're applying
for yours too,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.410
so I just figured you two
were doing something together.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.050
Eun Sang applied for
her severance pay too?

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.750
You didn't know?
I assumed you knew, being so close.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.590
You're all set.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.160
Enderion is reeling from
a string of bad news,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.030
plummeting more than fifty percent
from its peak.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.000
Financial experts warn that
if the current downtrend continues,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.040
it could trigger a market crash,
raising serious concerns.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.040
Wasn't this crypto on a bull run
just a little while ago?

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.210
- What's going on?
- Crypto, sir.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.780
- Nevertheless, Enderion...
- This stuff!

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.450
I heard someone
supposedly made a million off this.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.580
Gosh, and now look at it.
It's tanked.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.390
A million dollars is a huge amount,
isn't it?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.920
I wish people
who made that much money...

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.660
had to wear a name tag or something.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.190
- Why's that?
- So I can mooch a coffee off them.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.930
Would you like some coffee?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.730
- What?
- Why are you offering?

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.870
- I also hit ten...
- You made a million dollars?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.570
punches.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.410
I got ten punches on my coffee card.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.710
- Excuse me, Eun Sang?
- Oh! You startled me.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.910
Yes.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.980
I'm sorry.
I just came to buy a bandage.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.550
Sure. Just a moment.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.620
(Enderion)

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.230
It keeps dropping...

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.860
It's dropping like a rock...

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.440
This feels like
a major unlucky streak.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.880
Tell me, oh wise one,
what does my future hold?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.310
(Father)

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720
Oh my gosh.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.490
Ma'am, what is it with you now?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.830
If you're going to be this dramatic,
just go get a boyfriend.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.360
It's the crypto.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.160
I haven't slept a wink.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.900
I sold off my bags, my shoes,
and all my precious babies...

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.930
to buy crypto.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.570
But the price just keeps tanking.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.200
Gosh, well,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.870
getting rid of your precious babies
was a good call, but...

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.340
Just live your realistic life.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.610
Losing sleep and skipping meals...

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.910
isn't going to make
your crypto go up.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.650
At this point,
should I find another income source?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.960
Doing what?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.730
Portable hand sanitizer?

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.430
Masks?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.870
Listen, I have a gut feeling
about this.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.500
I feel a huge plague is going to
sweep the nation someday...

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.040
There you go again
with the crazy talk.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.340
- A plague? Give me a break.
- I'm serious!

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.550
If a specific product doesn't meet
consumer expectations,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.780
it's only a matter of time
before they drop their subscription.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.690
It's hard to predict how many people
will even subscribe.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.890
- As a new business venture,
- Did Eun Sang use her money...

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.690
- the risks seem too high.
- to buy low?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.160
- What was that?
- Sorry?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.230
What did you say?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.200
It was nothing.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.530
Okay, so? Go on.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.300
We'd be stuck
if we set everything up...

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.770
and then get too few subscribers.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.240
Manipulating the budget
and stock is a burden, too.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.910
- But...
- Realistically,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.180
there's no compelling reason
for a subscription service...

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.110
of snacks you can buy
at any convenience store.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.020
That's why I think
we need to rethink this...

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.220
and take a step back
to reconsider it objectively.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.320
Yes, I agree.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.690
- I was thinking the same thing.
- All right, in that case,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.330
let's all think this over
from every angle.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.130
Da Hae, address Da Hee's points
in a supplementary report.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.600
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, meeting adjourned. Let's go.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.670
- Thank you, sir.
- Good work.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.540
Okay, everyone else can head out.
Da Hae, can I have a word with you?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.270
- Okay.
- Good work, everyone.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.010
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.580
Why the long face?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.450
I wonder if dropping this business
is really the best for everyone.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.430
Listen, a company
isn't a place for Kumbaya moments.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.730
If we want what's best for everyone,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.190
we should all join the Peace Corps.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Right?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.800
- Why not discuss it with friends?
- What?

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.600
When you're chatting with friends,
sometimes ideas just start flowing.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.670
That group you always hang out with.
That crew of off-cycle hires...

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.880
I mean, your besties.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.480
Talk it over with them.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.920
Conversation is the solution
to all our problems.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980
Okay?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.690
Take your time.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.990
A conversation...

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.290
You're working late?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.270
Yes. I have to work late.
Help me brainstorm a bit,

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.570
and we can keep an eye
on our crypto.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.370
We can watch the charts live
and make some moves together.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.810
Ta-da!

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.010
I even brought snacks!

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.740
I've got tteokbokki,
fish cake soup, and sundae.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:49.810
Looks delicious, right?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.250
Should we book a conference room?

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.520
We could use the big screen...

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.420
- No way.
- What?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.950
- What?
- Is crypto a soccer match?

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.760
Why would you all gather around
just to watch it?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.530
Why not? This is as big
as the Korea-Japan match to us.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.500
I'm just tired.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.170
I'm heading out. Enjoy.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.840
(Marron Confectionery)

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.310
She could've stayed for a bit.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.080
I can't believe she's just left
like that.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.690
She seems really exhausted lately.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.620
She must have a lot on her plate.
She's been leaving work later, too.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.460
Why?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.130
Is the Sales Team that busy
these days?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.490
It seems that way.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.630
She doesn't discuss work in detail.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.660
True.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.430
- Okay, I'll set the 1-minute chart.
- Okay.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.770
Alright, let's pray.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.770
Okay, fine.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.140
Okay. Dear deities.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.110
If the crypto goes up,
I swear I'll be a better person.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.620
I'll take every flyer
from the old ladies on the street.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.150
And trash...

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.850
I'll be more thorough
with recycling...

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.790
and do my part for the environment.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.490
Please, I beg you,
just five percent.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.560
Just five percent!

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200
It dropped.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.100
Darn it.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.170
Dear deities!

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.940
If this crypto goes up,
I'll be good.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.070
I'll even stop losing my temper.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.710
Also, I'll stop drinking...

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280
You're going to stop?

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.020
I'll stick to domestic beer.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.390
Please, just five percent!

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.020
- Just five percent!
- Just five percent!

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.890
It dropped.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.160
Darn it.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.670
Dear deities!

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.670
- Dear deities!
- Dear deities!

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.240
- Dear deities!
- Dear deities!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.910
- Please, just five percent!
- Just five percent, please!

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.890
Did it go up?

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.290
No.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.760
No!

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.930
(Please go up one percent.)

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.000
What's this?

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.740
Did you see the crypto
dropped again...

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.970
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.240
I was calling to see if anyone
was interested in renting my place.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.950
I see. Please handle it
as soon as possible.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.380
It's pretty urgent.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.150
- Okay.
- What was that?

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220
Her apartment...

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.960
She's putting it on the market?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.020
This is huge.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.890
Did you see Hoppang Bite's post?

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.700
A coworker made a million dollars.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.300
They hit it big with crypto.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.200
It was called Enderion, I think?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.800
But didn't that crash recently?

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.740
They must've cashed out at the peak.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.340
You know it's all about timing.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.710
I'm so jealous.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.210
Who could it be?
You read the post and have no idea?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.680
It didn't say who.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.950
"She made all that money
off crypto,"

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.280
"but she won't
even discount a pair of stockings."

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.090
"Not only is she greedy,
she's stingy."

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.260
Does that ring a bell?

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.530
Come on, who else around here
sells stockings?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.060
Don't tell me,
the Kang Eun Sang Store?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.430
- Kang Eun Sang?
- Kang Eun Sang?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.630
She's so lucky.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.070
I bet she'll quit now.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.570
She's set for life now.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.970
Darn it, I should've bought
some crypto.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.470
I'm so jealous.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.080
- A million dollars?
- Gosh, but how did she do it?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.640
They said she did it with crypto.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.110
Isn't she close with Kim Ji Song?

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.420
They were.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.190
- I'll be back for the rest later.
- Okay.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.370
Someone here made
a million in crypto.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.670
To my recollection,
Ms. Kang wasn't the only one.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.570
That trio from off-cycle hires.
She probably invested with them.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.270
So they all made
a few hundred grand each?

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.440
Nope. Just Ms. Kang.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.640
So she wanted it all for herself.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640
And didn't tell them till the end?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.710
But they seemed so close.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.180
They probably stuck together
for work as off-cycle hires.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.450
In the end, they're just coworkers.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.150
Who do they think they are?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.260
Da Hae, here are the documents
you asked for.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.190
Right. Thanks.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.960
By the way, Da Hae,

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.300
it's about Ms. Eun Sang.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.300
Did she really make a million bucks
and buy a house?

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.340
That's really incredible.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740
What?

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.870
As if making a million
wasn't enough,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.740
now they're saying
she bought a house too?

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.480
Oh my.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.110
Since you two are close,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.280
I just figured you'd already heard
about it.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.720
Yes, well...

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.450
What?

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.290
Wait, this part about
her buying a house...

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.290
Didn't you find out from
Hoppang Bite's post?

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.390
There was nothing about that
in there.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.900
So how did you hear about it,
Da Hae?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.000
I just heard it somewhere.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.300
It's all over the office already.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.900
- A million dollars?
- She made a million dollars?

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.110
- What?
- A million...

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.180
- I should've gotten into crypto.
- Right.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.210
But...

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.980
Weren't you into crypto too, Da Hae?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.480
I wonder if only Ms. Eun Sang
made money.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.250
I wonder why.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.830
If I had a million dollars,
I'd quit on the spot.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:37.990
Me too.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.690
Honestly, that's better
than the lottery.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.870
So, we need a sales strategy
that reflects the current trends.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.500
We could do
a convenience store exclusive...

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.240
- Are you listening to me?
- Gosh, a million dollars.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.310
Sorry?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.980
Sir...

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.210
Sorry,
my mind wandered for a second.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.120
Are you sleepy?
Should I grab you a cup of coffee?

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.750
- I'll have a macchiato.
- I'll take a cheesecake.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.660
No, I just meant
from the break room...

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.820
I'm buying again?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.560
Well, the one who can afford it
should pay.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.690
Excuse me?

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.430
(Marron Confectionery)

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.040
Hey, we're running really late.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.140
Da Hae, the last bus is
in five minutes! Run!

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.840
Five minutes? Darn it.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.710
Hey, guys.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.440
Let's just get a cab.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980
What?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.080
- What?
- Eun Sang,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080
why are you hailing a cab?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.720
We can still catch the last bus
if we run.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.320
You'll spend more on hospital bills
if you mess up your knees. Get in!

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.390
What?

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.660
What's with her?
She always said cab fare is a waste.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.630
Excuse me, sir.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.500
Could you let me out
up ahead, please?

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.870
You're not going home, Eun Sang?

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.870
Yes, I have to make a quick stop.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.740
- Where to?
- I'm just meeting a friend.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.180
You have other friends besides us?

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.710
What are you, a detective?
What's with all the questions?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.180
Eun Sang, we'll get it.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.750
Don't be silly. I'll get it.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.160
You will?

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.590
Why not?

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.430
No, it's just...

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.760
What? Is there something
you want to say to me?

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.870
Aren't you the one
who has something...

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.470
to tell us?

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.370
Sir.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.540
Give the change to the girls
in the back.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.310
- Okay.
- Don't you two go wandering off.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.350
Go straight home, okay?

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:40.950
Okay.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920
For real?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.130
I heard her on the phone
with a realtor this morning.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.760
She's really putting her house
on the market?

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.230
But why?

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.330
Is it because
she bought a new place?

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.670
I don't know. Rumor is
that Eun Sang is going to quit.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.770
But why won't she tell us anything?

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:03.970
Shoot.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.910
Maybe she has her reasons.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.980
Maybe the timing just wasn't right.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.580
And she just didn't get to tell us.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.980
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.890
Right! We've been so busy lately,
we really haven't had time to talk.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.490
That's true.
We've been working late.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.390
- Yes, you're right.
- Yes.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.830
Darn it,
this company is the problem.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.260
We deserve a work-life balance.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.530
Then we'd actually have time
to talk like this.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.130
You're right. We're so tight.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.670
Does she really think
we'd be jealous...

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.970
just because she made some money?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.070
- They don't know us at all.
- Exactly.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.240
- Seriously.
- Oh! I have an idea.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640
What is it?

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.480
I was on the fence about canceling,
but what the heck, let's just go.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:46.820
Go where?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.950
You know. The place we booked
when crypto was up.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.760
I didn't expect the market
to suddenly crash, but...

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.230
Anyway, since we already booked it,
let's just go.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.360
Oh, you mean...

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.530
Where?

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.470
Ju Man,
where did you say we're going?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.370
A rock festival in the UK!

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.800
Yes, right. How are we supposed
to go to that?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.440
I sent out a ton of promo emails...

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.780
with your new song, profile,
and albums.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.380
The response was pretty good,
so I was getting my hopes up.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.110
And get this.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.580
We got a bite from overseas.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.720
They want you
at their fall festival.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.990
They'll cover your flight and hotel.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.090
All you have to do is show up.
So, naturally...

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.260
We're going!
We absolutely have to go.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.660
It might not be the main stage,
but it's a big deal.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.500
It'll be streamed
on official channels.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.370
So they actually heard my music
and reached out to book me?

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.070
That's what I'm telling you,
you punk!

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.610
- Don't get too worked up.
- Oh my gosh.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.140
We need to polish the band version
a little before then.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.680
Man, I've gotta hand it to you.
I kept telling you not to do it,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.550
but you were so stubborn,
and in the end,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.880
you're making it
to the UK after all.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.890
I'm proud of you, my friend!

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.950
Ham Ji Woo, you son of a gun!

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.490
We finally made it! We made it.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.460
- But when is it again?
- What?

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.900
This historic day of my UK debut.
When is it?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.130
That historic day? The date?

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.800
Wait a minute. Your company...

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.240
You still have vacation days, right?
You can make it work?

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.140
Of course!

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.050
I'm a director, for crying out loud.
You think I can't clear my schedule?

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.450
Don't you worry about it.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.050
There's no way
I'm missing this chance.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.720
- I'm going no matter what.
- Gosh, you scared me.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.120
- I'm going no matter what.
- Okay.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.550
- It's a sure thing.
- Okay.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.790
I absolutely have to go.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.360
I have to, but...

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.760
Oh, what am I going to do?

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.370
Thank you.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.650
You can tell it's pricey.
It's so meaty.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.290
- Yes.
- Right?

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.050
It sure beats imitation crab meat.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.160
Hey, come on.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.120
How can you even compare lobster
to imitation crab?

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.760
Should we each get another one?
It's on me.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.560
What?

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.040
Crypto tanked again last night.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.470
Where are you
getting all this money?

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640
Eun Sang,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.410
is there something
you need to tell us?

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880
What?

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.120
Yes. Something you were
too busy to share?

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.550
Right.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.190
I...

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.230
have something to tell you guys.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.260
What is it?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.590
I'm all ears.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.760
I...

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.070
think I have hemorrhoids.
It's killing me every night.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.910
I'm kidding.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.110
Guys, I don't have anything
to tell you.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.550
But I do have...

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.080
I guess it's true that
the person involved in the rumor...

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080
is always the last to know.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.720
A rumor? What rumor?

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.160
This is so frustrating.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960
It's about you.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.500
The rumor is that you made a killing
with crypto,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.230
that you cashed out, bought a house,
and now you're planning to quit.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.540
And you did it all without saying
a single word to us...

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.610
Eun Sang, it's the talk
of the entire office.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.810
What? Where did a ridiculous rumor
like that come from?

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.010
Guys, who would even believe that?

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.990
Seriously, who would believe that?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.600
Wait, you must actually
believe this.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.400
It's not that we believe it.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.380
Eun Sang!

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.010
Wait.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.650
Eun Sang!

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.420
Where are you going?
We're not done talking.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.330
- What else is there to say?
- Did you really sell your crypto?

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.300
All by yourself? Without telling us?

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.430
Da Hae, you can't just ask her
like that...

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.340
Do I really need to answer that?

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.110
Yes! Just say something. Anything.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.410
You don't exactly look like
you're in the mood to listen.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.720
You look like you want to punch me.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.360
You're really not going
to say anything?

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.260
Fine. Then we're done.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.870
- What?
- We just met through work, right?

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.840
This happens when we overstep
and get too involved personally.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.140
We're just coworkers,
nothing more than that. Right?

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.910
Hey, come on, Da Hae.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.210
I'll be more careful from now on.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.510
I won't cross the line again,
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:20.850
What? "Ms.?"

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.280
Ms. Kang Eun Sang? How dare you!

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.860
- Eun Sang...
- What?

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.090
Did you just grab my hair?

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.830
I grabbed your bag.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.930
Fine, I did.
What are you going to do about it?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.400
Eun Sang, let go of her.
Let go and talk.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.830
Excuse me. You think
you're the only one with a hand?

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.280
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to grab mine?

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.910
Gosh, Jung Da Hae.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.350
You were raised right, weren't you?

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.950
You're such a proper young lady.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.090
Darn it, just let me go!

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.220
- Eun Sang!
- Hey!

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.560
Do you have to say things
in such a hurtful way?

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.560
At least
I'm saying something hurtful!

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.460
But you're not saying
anything at all.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.260
Darn it, you're unbelievable...

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.630
- You little...
- Darn it, just let me go!

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.600
- Let go of her.
- I said, let go!

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:13.970
Let go.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600
That hurts.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.970
Da Hae, are you okay?

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.270
Are you okay?

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.440
Eun Sang, what's wrong with you?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.710
Think whatever you want.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.420
Believe whatever
you want to believe.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.550
Do whatever you want!

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.190
- Darn it.
- Eun Sang! Wait!

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.330
Yes, sorry about that.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960
Kang Eun Sang.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.960
Kang Eun Sang!

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.000
What do you mean,
"think whatever I want?"

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.970
Tell me before you go.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.900
Where are you going?

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:50.910
Da Hae!

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.010
Da Hae!

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.890
Come on. Are you crazy?

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.120
So you bought a car?

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.920
- What?
- Da Hae...

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.360
You really did sell your crypto
to buy a house and even a car.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.800
I bet you'll quit your job too.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.830
Get out of the way.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.770
Then just say so.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.640
You think you can just leave
without a word? Is that it?

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.010
Seriously?
Are we just coworkers to you?

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.410
Is that why you're acting like this?

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:32.680
When did I say that?

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.380
You're the one who's saying it.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.380
You're supposed to say,
"No, we're not!"

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.390
That we're not just coworkers.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.390
That we're real friends.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.860
That we're family.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.630
If you cashed out your crypto,
why didn't you just tell us?

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.360
Were you afraid we'd curse you out?

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.770
Fine, I cashed out.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.380
- To pay you guys back.
- What?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.750
What's this?

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.550
The crypto...

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.830
It kept dropping.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.300
You were about to lose all
of your initial investments,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.130
so I got an advance on my severance
to cover your losses,

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.440
but even that wasn't quite enough.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.100
What are you talking about?

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.010
Then putting your house up
for sale...

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.740
Wait, and this car is...

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.450
I'm a designated driver!

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.920
I needed cash fast.
What choice did I have?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.620
I had to take on a driving gig.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.950
Today,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.390
I asked you to meet up
so I could give you this money,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.890
but things just kept
getting messed up.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.230
But still, why the crypto?

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.430
You said it'd go back up
if we waited.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.200
I said that so you wouldn't worry.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800
If by some chance things went south,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.170
I was planning to pay you back
for everything.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.110
It was my idea to get into crypto
in the first place.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.580
To be honest,

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.450
ever since I suggested
we invest in crypto,

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.590
I haven't had a single moment
of peace.

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.120
I know this was
our only option left,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.360
but still...

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.130
I...

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.640
I was afraid that I had...

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.110
just made your lives even harder.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.280
I was scared too.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.480
I don't understand...

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.620
Then why didn't you just tell us?

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.790
How could I tell you
something like that?

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.790
That to pay you back,
I used severance, worked a side job?

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.460
You would've felt so burdened.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.300
I did it so you wouldn't worry,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.530
but if I just told you everything...

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.600
I guess you're right.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.900
I really wish I hadn't heard that.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.340
If you had made a profit,
it was yours to keep.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.040
Why would you give that up
because of us?

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.420
Why, for our sake,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.690
would you give up
on your own happiness?

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.890
Kang Eun Sang!

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.760
You're supposed to make
a ton of money!

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.230
Buy a house, buy a car,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.100
quit your job,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.400
and go on amazing vacations!

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.970
You have to live your life...

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.940
and be happy.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.610
As happy as you can possibly be!

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.610
That's all we ever wanted for you.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.920
Who asked you for money?

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.420
She's right!

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.460
You should look out for yourself.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.560
Why are you being so foolish?

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.390
Gosh, you guys...

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.900
What are you two idiots
talking about?

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.100
You two are my reward.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.340
I've already gotten my share.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.670
I've received more than enough,
you fools

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.480
I'm...

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.680
going to be with you guys...

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.250
until the very end.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.120
I swear, she drives me nuts.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.190
Honestly!

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.630
Why didn't you tell us?

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.930
Excuse me.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.470
Aren't you going to drive?

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.640
- No, she's not!
- No, I'm not.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.550
A bond that needs no words.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.580
Isn't that what friendship is about?

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.450
Am I the only one cringing?

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.220
Did you really have to post this?

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.590
I wanted to tell the whole world
about our friendship.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.160
Guess I was feeling sentimental
last night.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.830
I just want to drown in my tears.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.400
I'm pretty sure we had
a touching moment yesterday.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.140
Tell me about it. Now it feels
like we're at a funeral.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.810
Why won't it go up? Why?

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.980
(Enderion)

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.480
- Why can't I?
- What made you think you could?

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.580
But I'm an executive director.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.020
You make more than the others,
so you're expected to work harder.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.120
That's just how it is.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.420
But I'm still an executive director.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.860
Also, you used way too many
of your vacation days this spring.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.860
If I do a good job, shouldn't I get
double the vacation days?

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.270
Don't we have a benefit like that?

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.500
Since you are good at your job,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.470
your schedule has doubled.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:02.080
Also, on the days you requested off,
there's an important CEO meeting.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.840
What if I go straight to the airport
after the meeting...

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:04.980
In the evening,

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.850
there is an even more
important meeting...

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.020
the chairman will attend.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.050
Then what about me?

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.020
When the do I get to handle
my important work?

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.160
About that...

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.790
About that?

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.700
Hang in there, sir.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.130
Good luck!

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.610
Gosh, he just said, "Hang in there."

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.280
I...

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.010
- I needed to talk to you.
- It was just a stupid pipe dream.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.280
What?

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.920
- What was?
- The crypto.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.390
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
I should have known better.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.130
Still,
you need a dream to live for, right?

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.360
Dreams don't put food on the table.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.400
You just have to...

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.170
hold on to what you've got,
and that's all that matters.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.810
Getting greedy will
only lead to ruin.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.110
It's nothing more than
a fleeting dream.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.580
Right.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.720
You wanted my advice?

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.380
Is everything okay?

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:18.890
Oh, that...

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.850
It's nothing.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.260
Am I really cursed or something?
Nothing is going my way.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.960
I need to know what my future holds.
I'm scared I can't see what's ahead.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.170
So, what should I do with my life?

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.540
(Dad)

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.110
Come on, just say something,
anything, Dad.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.280
Ji Song, could you
process these expenses?

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.390
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.890
- What's this?
- First-half donation records.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.130
It includes donations to churches
and temples, too.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.430
You sponsor snacks for
the little monks, too?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.800
Yes, I went along
to help with the delivery last time.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.840
It was really nice.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.170
Isn't it better to receive
than give?

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.570
I was going through
a hard time then,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.870
but just getting away for a bit...

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.540
really lifted my spirits.
It helped clear my head.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.880
And one of the monks there...

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.680
even wrote me a good luck charm.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.250
A good luck charm?

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.590
Do you have a wish
you're hoping for?

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.290
Doesn't everyone?

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.090
Well...

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.960
Here, have one of these
before you get back to it.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.600
Okay, I'm counting on you.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.700
What's with him?
When did he get so smooth?

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.150
Dear deity!

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.720
Are you really going
to do this to me?

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:02.720
Dear deity! Clock in for your shift!

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:06.160
Get to work on our crypto!

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.330
Let's just go.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.000
Go where?

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.200
To see a deity.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.440
Isn't that a little extreme?

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.340
No, I meant let's go see my dad.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.240
He's a monk.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.380
Doesn't he have,
like, a direct line to dieties?

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.750
But why would we go to your dad?

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.450
- I see.
- It's not like starving...

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:32.550
and staring at the charts
will make a difference.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.290
All we're doing is watching it drop.
It's just making me sick.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.690
We'd be better off getting away
from crypto for a while.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.260
Otherwise, we might get wiped out.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.550
Let's go.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580
Eun Sang.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460
Eun Sang.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.960
My dad.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:22.240
Thank you all for
making the journey out here.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:26.240
This is a place to unburden yourself
and seek enlightenment.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.380
You've come here to briefly escape
the noise and turmoil of the world,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.780
which must be why you've come.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.810
Yes.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:38.020
So, from this moment,
to help you hear your inner voice,

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.990
we will now collect your phones.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.160
What?

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.360
What gives?

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.700
Thank you.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.400
Excuse me.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.540
Do we really have to
hand over our phones?

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.110
Let me just check it one last time.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.810
Come on, you two.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.580
Isn't this the whole reason
we came here?

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.450
Let's just tough it out.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.360
Fine.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800
Right.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.440
A digital detox.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.540
And a crypto detox. Let's do this.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.850
What's wrong?
Feeling a little shaky?

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.050
No, it's not that...

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.620
Is that crypto withdrawal?

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.190
- For real?
- No, it's not!

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.020
You're shaking a lot.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.120
- Don't.
- Want me to hold you steady?

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.660
No. Really, I'm fine.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.940
It's because your minds still linger
in the secular world...

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.010
that things like this
are bound to happen.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.750
You must empty your minds.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.580
You must cast aside all attachments
without regret.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.520
Only then can you
truly feel unburdened.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.520
I bet my medical bills
will burden me more.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.990
Gosh, my knees...

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.650
It's amazing, really.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.390
We only unplugged from the world
for half a day,

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.690
but I already feel so much lighter.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.030
Maybe it's because we've emptied
ourselves of all our desires?

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.330
What desires did you let go of?

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.840
The desire for a nice, cold beer.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.500
I got rid of it.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.310
My desire for a long, healthy life
without taking care of myself.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.680
I got rid of that.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.280
That urge to watch
"just one more vid" on YouTube.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480
It's gone.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.850
The desire for our crypto...

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.350
to go up.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.630
I got rid of all of that, too.
How about you?

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.230
Me too.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.200
I got rid of it all.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.000
It feels like my desire for crypto
got a full-on enema.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.140
It's completely clean.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.200
- All flushed away.
- I couldn't get rid of it.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:53.310
What?

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.680
What is that? Where'd you get it?

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.350
I pretended to turn it in earlier.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.630
You little devil.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.730
- You'll burn in torment.
- Crypto!

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.000
Aren't you curious at all?

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.200
- It could've gone up by now.
- Did it?

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.400
I don't know.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.710
I have no signal,
so I can't get online.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.610
Where do we have to go?
Where can we get a signal?

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.150
Hey.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.320
Hold on.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.430
Hey.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:55.440
- Why won't this thing connect?
- Hey, try over there.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.670
Just a sec.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.710
- For crying out loud.
- What's wrong?

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.610
After coming all this way
for a temple stay,

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.640
we said we'd let go
of all our greed,

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.050
but look at us now.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.480
I'm starting to have
a serious reality check.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.080
Hey. A reality check is one thing.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.780
But the bear market hit us hard.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.190
Please.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.220
How can you really let go of greed?

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.920
Even if you get an enema,
it just keeps building up.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.230
You never stop pooping, right?

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:19.690
How can anyone live without pooping?

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.200
- Hey, Ji Song, give it here.
- Good idea.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.500
Let me see it.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.530
- The signal's really weak.
- Hold on.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.630
Watch out!

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.040
Ouch, that hurts.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.580
- Da Hae, are you okay?
- Da Hae!

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.010
- Da Hae.
- Hey, are you okay?

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.080
Yes, I'm okay.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.280
Da Hae.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.120
It hurts.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.660
You're saying...

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.670
this is all because of crypto?

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.770
Is money really that important
to you?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.740
Who in the world doesn't like money?

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.040
What would you spend it on?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.380
There's no shortage of things.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.250
What do you hope to be with money?

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.620
Well...

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.790
My friends.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.890
Do you know the one Korean word
that Koreans can never get right?

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.590
It's "Pull."

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.990
Even when the sign says "Pull,"
most of us just push anyway.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.300
And yet, the door still opens.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:35.800
But there are some doors in life
that will only open if you pull.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.700
Money is one of those doors.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.610
Some people say you can
take it or leave it,

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.840
but there are moments
when you absolutely must have it.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.680
But what's more important
is what you do after you open it.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.650
Once you open it and walk through,
what will you do?

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.960
Where will you go?

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.200
Be the master of your own desires.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.700
Then you'll know what you truly want
and where you ought to go.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.540
You'll be able to decide
for yourselves.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.140
May I...

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.340
ask you a question?

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.950
Please do.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.680
Are you really...

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.780
Ji Song's dad?

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.320
For someone who's basically a monk
to be her father...

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.660
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.560
Wait, is she...

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.030
adopted?

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.040
Have mercy.

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:47.640
The path is treacherous.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.380
Please be careful on your way down.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.950
We're so grateful
for your hospitality.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:53.810
I'll wire the money
for the roof tiles...

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.150
as soon as I get back to Seoul.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.630
I don't really have much to say.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.100
You make your own.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:20.810
Your choices and your actions
become your destiny.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.010
There's no such thing
as a predetermined destiny.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.210
It's all in your hands.

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.920
Who asked you for a sermon?

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.380
And from where I'm standing,

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.720
you've made a really good choice.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.320
You've got nothing to worry about.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.860
Says the phony monk who acts
like he knows everything.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.300
I'm going now. Take care.

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:47.700
Yes, goodbye.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.470
And if I text, make sure you answer.
I get worried.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.340
I'm leaving now.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.380
Don't get sick!

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.810
And make sure you eat.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.320
I'm off.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.380
Bye!

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.090
Bye!

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.090
Let's go.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.060
Bye!

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:21.670
Where exactly are we going?

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.540
- The bus terminal...
- It doesn't matter where.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.310
- What?
- You guys, listen.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.980
I'm unsure what to do or where to go
once I make some money,

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.080
but as long as I'm with you two,

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.950
even if we're headed
for rock bottom,

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.520
even if we end up in the pits,

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.080
I think everything will be okay.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.590
If we just hang in there together,
things will work out somehow.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.160
Because just hanging in there
is half the battle, right?

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.930
Could we maybe just make it
to the bus terminal?

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.800
Why are you being so dramatic?

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.140
I'm so sleepy.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.110
Gosh, this is nice.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.110
All that time on that darn roof...

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.850
My entire body is killing me.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.680
Let's get you to a doctor.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.530
Oh, man.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.500
Gosh.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.810
(We will now resume service
for the train to the moon)

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.120
What was that?

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.590
Who goes there?

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.120
Who dares play music
in this pit of despair?

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.260
Darn it, I must still be dreaming.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800
What?

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.440
What?

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:10.580
This place isn't wretched,
it's rock and roll!

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:11.950
What?

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:22.560
It's outer space.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.040
We're actually in space.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:41.040
Are we actually going all the way
to the moon?

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.920
What are you all waiting for?
Strike up the music!

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.300
No way.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.200
- Hey!
- Okay.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.470
On your feet!

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.920
Guitar!

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.090
Oh, yes!

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:20.270
(Enderion 1,400 dollars)

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.830
You pesky mosquito.

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:42.800
(Dr. Ham Ji Woo)

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.710
As if I wasn't mad enough.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.480
Come here. Where'd you go?

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.250
Darn it!

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.120
There you are.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.090
(Marron Confectionery)

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.690
A snack subscription service.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.900
What if we introduced a plan
that lets you share with friends?

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.770
You're proposing a shareable plan?

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.100
Yes. Solo, Friends,
and Family Snack.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.210
We'd break it down into three tiers.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:01.010
If people subscribe together,

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:03.910
it's more affordable
since they can split the cost.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.380
And from our perspective,
it's also a great marketing opportunity.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:09.450
For example,
a "favorite snack" party...

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:11.280
for streaming services,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.120
or "Tastier Together."

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.560
Using various hashtags like these,

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:18.360
it would connect our brand image
with the customers' memories.

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.230
Applause!

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.840
That's fantastic, right?

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.210
How did you even think of that?

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:38.410
The key is preventing cancellations.
Making sure customers stick with it.

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.410
If they're motivated
to work together,

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:42.010
they're more likely
to keep subscribing.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.280
The fun of sticking
with it together...

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.220
will make them
want to keep subscribing.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.320
- That's a pretty good idea.
- It's a great idea.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.790
- What about you, Da Hee?
- Right.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.090
Yes, I think it's a great idea.

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.700
All right, then.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.070
- Let's move forward with this idea.
- Okay!

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.870
Okay, next! How are we doing
on online marketing?

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.300
Yes, we're in the process of
reaching out to influencers.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:12.250
Did you hear about that new project
the marketing team is pushing?

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:15.850
It's going to be a world of pain
for every department.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.090
Was it that JDH girl?

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.790
Why make the whole group suffer
for one incompetent person?

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:24.790
(Hoppang Bite: No hope
for marketing team's new project...)

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.410
Da Hee.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.880
Could I talk to you for a second?

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.350
With me?

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.090
What? What's not true?

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.790
The rumor about Eun Sang.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:57.190
You said she made a fortune
and bought a house,

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.260
and kept all the profits
for herself.

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:01.060
You're the one
who told me the rumor,

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:04.130
even though you know we're close.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.330
- No, that's...
- It's not true.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.530
Because none of it is.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.740
I'd appreciate it if you stopped
spreading these weird rumors.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.310
Da Hae, you're misunderstanding.
I didn't mean any harm.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.580
And one more thing, Da Hee.

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:22.180
The thing is,

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.780
I'm actually dating Ham Ji Woo.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.420
What?

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.090
That letter,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.790
I actually wrote it...

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.660
for Ham Ji Woo.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:36.600
I was trying to get it back secretly
so no one would see,

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.530
but of course, it had to come out
of the trash can.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:45.240
I told you that was a mistake...

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:48.980
But Da Hae,

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:52.480
are you suggesting I did that
on purpose?

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.010
Because if you are, I'm a little...

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.320
Let's say you did,

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.780
just hypothetically.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.920
If this nagging suspicion I have
turns out to be right...

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960
I mean,

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.600
if you're trying to rattle me,
Da Hee,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.400
don't waste your energy.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840
I won't be rattled.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:33.850
Boo!

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.190
- You scared me!
- What are you doing here?

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.560
Just hang on a second...

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.560
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.260
Good. I needed to see you too.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.800
- I was just...
- Can I go first?

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200
What?

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.040
Sure.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.100
I've given this a lot of thought.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.610
Mosquitoes.

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:56.180
What? I'm sorry, mosquitoes?

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:59.280
To kill one, you use both hands...

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.550
and clap them together, right?

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:04.520
In a way, they die to applause.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.390
And in a way,
I'm actually a little jealous.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.720
So that's how I'm going to live
from now on.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.120
Like what?

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.830
- What, like a mosquito?
- Yes.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:19.330
I won't waste my life on work I hate
just to die with a bonus.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.170
When my time comes,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.870
I want to live singing songs I love,
dying to the sound of applause.

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.710
I see. Mosquitoes, applause...

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.240
Da Hae, I'll make you a promise.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.910
My dream might not provide,

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:36.180
but I will.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.320
I'll never let you go hungry.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.190
- Thanks a lot.
- And for as long as I possibly can,

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.290
these veins and this handsome face
you love so much,

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.030
- I'll maintain them.
- Again, my sincerest thanks.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.360
And I will never, ever
make you cry again.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.470
So...

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.840
- I...
- Hold on. Wait a minute.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.740
Don't tell me this is a proposal?

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.610
Is that the vibe we're going for?

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.710
Why are you bringing this up now,
at work of all places...

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.110
- What I'm trying to say is...
- Da Hae!

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.950
- Hey!
- Our crypto's up! It's really up!

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.880
What? For real?

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.460
Da Hae, I'm quitting my job.
I'm out of here.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.860
What?

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.290
Hold on, what?

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.030
Dear deities,

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:29.640
why is my heart pounding right now?

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:33.840
Is it because my crypto dream
is finally coming true?

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.880
Or is it because he's about to quit
and give up a jackpot of a bonus,

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.610
all for some unrealistic
dream of his?

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.890
Dear deities,

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.750
please, just give me an answer.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.130
(To the Moon)

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.820
Do you really have to go to England?

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.550
You don't want me to go?

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:18.920
Should I give up on my music again?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.390
Who said anything
about leaving you behind?

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.760
I think my future lies
outside of this company.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.960
A business? Please.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.060
A bit of money gives
you crazy ideas.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.130
They're not crazy ideas.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:30.160
I've actually done all the research.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.860
What is this?

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.070
A disciplinary hearing?

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.600
Why is the Kang Eun Sang Store
involved?

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:36.570
- You turned it into a market.
- I'm so sorry.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.270
Please, forgive me just this once.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.170
It's no use.
I was the one who reported her.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.540
You did what, Da Hee?

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.410
Hoppang Bite.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.650
