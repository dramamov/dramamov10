[Episode 5]

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.840
They said she left about two hours ago to go back to America.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.340
Let's go to the airport.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.420
If it was two hours ago, there's still a possibility of catching up to her.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.310
According to the priest, it's not like Laura Kane couldn't speak any Korean at all.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.060
So she understood most of it, even if she didn't know how to speak it.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.650
Then was she pretending she didn't know?

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.760
It means that she was able to communicate with Lee Seong Gon.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.510
She probably understood some of what Lee Seong Gon was saying.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.460
After Laura Kane met with Lee Seong Gon...

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.680
They said that caused her to develop a stress-induced disorder, right?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.150
Yes.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.290
Just tell her, if you meet her again,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.500
to live with what I said in her mind.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.250
Murder.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.450
Lee Seong Gon must've told his crimes to Laura Kane.

We're too late.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.180
Do you think that maybe she'll get in contact after arriving in America?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.610
I don't know.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.890
I guess there's no reason for her to tell us directly.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.950
Her brother will become a murderer,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.590
and she'll have to live the rest of her life as the sister of a murderer.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.570
I'm sorry.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.070
I... I have sinned.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.720
I lied to you two.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.010
When you were young, your father was a barber, right?

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.990
And Laura Kane's mother helped with the shaving.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.180
The reason you put white gowns on the victims

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.570
was because of the childhood memories

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.000
of that terrible experience. Isn't that right?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.950
It's just so unfair, Detective!

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.070
This all happened because of her and her mother!

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.480
Why do I have to live like this by myself? Why?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.620
She gets to live happily in America, and I have to live while suffering in pain. Why?

You! Why are you putting on the red lipstick again? Why?

If you live holding onto that, it'll just make you suffer more.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.620
Did you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.950
kill them all?

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.880
All five?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.500
Then out of the five,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.120
are you saying there was a woman you didn't kill?

Who is it?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.780
How would I know?

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.760
Well, that would be something only the real killer knows.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.900
You said you killed them all, you bastard.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.190
When did I?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.200
I never said that.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.210
Well, it feels like we have to record our conversation or something.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.020
I never said that with my own mouth.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.400
It's just so unfair, Detective!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.410
This all happened because of her and her mother!

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.320
Why do I have to live like this? Why?

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.080
She gets to live happily in America,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.490
and I have to live while suffering in pain. Why?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.350
This was the motive for your crimes.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.000
Could that

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.000
count as a motive?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.960
To say that I killed people for that reason?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.440
Yeah.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.570
Okay.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.110
That's right.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.120
You never had any reason.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.490
You just wanted to blame someone else for your urge to kill.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.590
The murder weapon, your past, the traces you left behind,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.090
all of them point to you as the culprit.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.010
You can't slip out of this.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.050
Whether you killed four or five,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.170
you can't return to society anyway.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.930
Just...

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.110
tell me that you didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.340
For the dead Jeong Hui Joo. For the family that was left behind.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.150
That's the last way you can pretend to have some humanity. That's the last way.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.840
Wow, you're pretty naive.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.960
I mean, think about it. If I said Jeong Hui Joo is the only one I didn't kill,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.870
then did I kill the rest of them?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.130
I mean, why do I need to say that? Why? Why?

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.340
You'll be remembered forever, right?

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.660
As the protagonist of a rare serial murder case that spawned a copycat.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.640
Instead of a silly imitation criminal.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.730
Take him.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.170
By the way.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.550
I mean,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.070
I won't be seeing these people again, right?

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.660
What a shame. They were fun people.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.480
Let's go.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.970
Is there something I should know about based on what Lee Seong Gon said?

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:17.670
Oh Ji Hyeok, tell him the story we heard when we met Lee Seong Gon's sister.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.160
What is it?

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.090
I'll send you the recording of the testimony.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.980
It'll help unveil Lee Seong Gon's motive.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.200
Okay. I'll make sure to clarify the source in the report.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.960
No, you don't have to state that we found this out. However,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.660
you just need to remember that we have that information too.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.820
How embarrassing.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.050
- Why?
- The fact that I was begging and asking

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.340
about Jeong Hui Joo and stuff to a bastard that's not even human.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.590
That's so embarrassing.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.520
Even though I knew it wouldn't work in the slightest.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.050
Why am I like this these days?

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.240
- It's puberty.
-What?

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.300
It's puberty meeting old age. It's a rare case.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.670
Yeah, I guess it's puberty, like you said.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.670
My body is old, but my mind is still like a kid's.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.170
So embarrassing.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.370
Hyeongnim, this is the translation of Lee Seong Gon's sister's testimony.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.600
It clarifies why he killed women the way he did.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.700
I think it'll be admissable in court too.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.130
Did I tell you to make that judgement?

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.020
- Excuse me?
- I make the decisions!

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.940
Don't get ahead of yourself. And watch your mouth, okay?

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.730
Yes, sir.

[I'm sorry, I... I have sinned. I lied to you two... (silence)]

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.960
My stepdad cut my mom's throat with his razor blade.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.500
And her white gown turned red with blood.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.920
I still remember it like yesterday.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.720
And I think the image must have stuck forever for my brother, too.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.580
Why did your stepdad kill your mother?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.000
He got mad because

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.980
my mom put red lipstick on her lips.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.700
I was so young. That's all I remember.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.070
You remembered the bad memories from your childhood, right?

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.850
So you put a white gown on the victims,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.330
and put on the lipstick.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.910
I don't understand what you're talking about.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.000
Well, if that's not it, coincidentally, the method that serial killer Kim Hyeong Bok used to commit murder

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.340
reminded you of your hidden past.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.390
So you committed a crime by imitating Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.130
Which one is it? Out of those two?

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.110
Anyway...

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.360
whatever it is, you're trash.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.700
By the way, Detective,

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.910
I didn't kill anyone in the first place.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.350
And I'm not a copycat or whatever, I

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.990
was just trying to scare her.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.720
Of course, from your side of it,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.740
it would be good for me to be a copycat

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.640
because you blabbed to the reporters that I am.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.990
No, no, you don't have to worry about us.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:38.930
Then, not this case, but one from before.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.760
Should I say that I did it?

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.810
Huh?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.210
But I never killed a person.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.570
Is that so?

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.810
But you know what, I have no intention of getting a confession out of a bastard like you.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.370
All you need to say is that you kidnapped a person after doing drugs.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.800
Okay?

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.890
Mr. Lee Seong Gon, you have the right to refuse to give testimony that could be used against you in a court of law,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.750
and you have the right to speak to an attorney as well.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.080
Oh right,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.880
one more thing.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.950
If you would like, we can refer you to a specialist for a mental evaluation.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.100
I wonder if that bastard will say something random in front of the judge.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.990
You know, this kind of guy has some strange urges to show off.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:56.850
He won't because there's only one thing on his mind.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.040
"I must survive somehow and get out."

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.060
"Only then I can kill more people."

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.180
- Here he comes! There!
- He's coming! There he is!

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.240
Are you admitting to all the charges?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.700
I... told the police the crimes I committed,

Ugh, this...

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.520
Didn't we already expect him to act this way?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.680
The problem is whether the Seoul MIU

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.990
has the determination to investigate Lee Seong Gon to the end.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.790
They'll probably make an agreement. Like, "Just say that you did this much."

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:26.200
This means that he will just be a copycat, and Kim Hyeong Bok will be left as the serial killer.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.810
No, that's not right. I sent everything I found out to the MIU.

It doesn't matter if the MIU doesn't send it to the prosecution.

The investigation's conclusion isn't out yet. Let's stand back a little longer.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.800
Stand back for what? It's obvious what will happen. We know what they're like.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.960
Then, shouldn't our chief do something?

Hey! Why should we escalate this to the chief?

Diabetes isn't a disease only adults get.

It's a disease that pains even children due to genetics or other pre-existing conditions.

They don't realize it at first.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.650

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.920
We've finished investigating.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.300
The data has been sent to the prosecution already as well.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.160
Even if Lee Seong Gon changed his statement, it wouldn't matter much.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.660
He won't change it, either.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.660
I don't know why those people are so obsessive.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.780
I don't know, either.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.260
Are you saying

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:23.930
that you can't order or control the people beneath you?

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.710
Kang Do Chang, that guy.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:33.640
He's a guy who ran out of his own wedding to capture a culprit.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:40.580
Out of all of us, there is no policeman who can control that guy.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.720
Listen to what your little sister said.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.410
I quit being a nun because I thought that I don't deserve to be one.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.660
After I came back to the States, I kept thinking about what I...

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.510
what I should do for my brother, and...

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.860
my brother said that...

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.410
that he killed people because of me.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.790
This crazy bitch.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.600
I've done him wrong.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.120
So much wrong. My life has been too happy

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.880
in a way he has never been able to feel or experience.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.350
And never did I ever consider the amount of pain that...

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.280
that he must've went through, and...

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.220
and I'm so sorry. I...

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.590
What's she saying?

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.090
I mean, what are you doing? Huh?

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.120
What? If you show this to me, did you think that I...

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.150
I would confess that I killed all of them?

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.600
I didn't kill anyone.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.680
You told Laura Kane that you killed people because of her.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.460
So?

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.080
So what can she do?

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.830
Bring her here. Bring her here, and tell her to talk in front of everyone.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:00.110
It doesn't matter because I just have to say I didn't kill them.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.510
- That's not going to happen.
- Of course. She won't come.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.940
Why would she come here from America?

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.720
It's annoying. It's not her business.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.970
She will never come here.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:16.270
That's right, she won't. Actually, she can't. She can't come.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.440
Because she's dead.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.070
Because she killed herself.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.280
What?

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.030
What are you talking about?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.010
I know...

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.360
I know how much my brother loved his dad.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:54.580
And I know how much pain he feels just... just to see me live and go on.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.150
Please tell my brother that...

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.660
that I'm sorry I left him when I remember how much he cared for me.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:05.280
That I didn't come looking for him sooner, and...

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.800
and that there's no need for him to hate anyone.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.490
Because... because it's me who messed up.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.520
Just...

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.400
just hate me.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.230
Please stop.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.370
Why? Why? Why?

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.440
Why?

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.200
Why did she do it?

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.460
Can't you tell?

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.510
She sacrificed herself for you.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.240
To stop you.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.400
Crazy bitch!

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:19.260
How dare she fucking kill herself, crazy bitch.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.850
When she knows who caused this.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.500
When she knows who caused this!

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:31.000
When she knows! When she knows why I'm like this! When she knows!

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.980
When she knows for whom I killed people.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.050
When she knows.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.870
Sacrifice?

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.050
Stop joking.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.390
Th-This... if it weren't for this bitch and her mom,

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.450
my father wouldn't have died, and I wouldn't have killed people.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.580
It's all her fault!

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.070
How could you call that sacrifice? Stop joking around.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.010
It's a relief.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:06.040
It's such a relief.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.440
Crazy bitch.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.650
At least she died knowing why I killed people.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.490
What a relief.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.030
Kang So Jeong,

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.860
twenty years old.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.910
Jobseeker.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.720
Jeong Hye Jin, twenty-six. Banker.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.840
Choi Yoon Ah, twenty-five, nursery school teacher.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.360
Park Seon Mi, twenty-one. College student.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.210
And...

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.630
Jeong Hui Joo, twenty-eight, office worker.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.240
Kang So Jeong, Jeong Hye Jin,

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.860
Choi Yoon Ah,

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.030
Park Seon Mi,

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.810
and Seong Joo Ri, who ended as attempted murder.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.930
All five of them were on the bus that you were driving.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.560
However,

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.340
Jeong Hui Joo was never on that bus.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.150
Why is that?

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.730
Why was it different for her only?

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.710
Am I Jeong Hui Joo?

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.870
Red lipstick doesn't look good on someone like her.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.290
Someone else killed her.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.540
- Team Leader Woo.
- Yes?

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.830
The testimony from today was recorded, right?

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:46.980
Yes, of course.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.780
Then, give them the data.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.300
Yes, I will.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.470
If you're busy, we can hand it over to the prosecutor.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.370
What should we do?

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.940
Good work.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.210
For the rest of your life, live doing cop work.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.620
Damn it.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.230
Lee Seong Gon, who has been denying the allegations thus far,

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:27.680
confessed his crimes in full today.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.070
Does that mean all five cases were committed by Lee Seong Gon?

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.370
No.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.110
He is denying the fourth murder.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.120
The victim's name

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.840
is Jeong Hui Joo.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.580
Is that Lee Seong Gon's claim?

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.670
Or has it been revealed to be true?

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.400
We are investigating at the moment.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.400
Did Kim Hyeong Bok, who has been said to be the culprit, have any relation to this case?

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.150
No. Not at all.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.060
On behalf of the entire police force,

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.580
I express my deepest apologies and condolences

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.890
to Mr. Kim Hyeong Bok,

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.890
who passed away unfairly framed.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:14.450
[Chief of Metropolitan Investigation Unit's deep apology to the deceased Kim Hyeong Bok]

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.930
We, the police, admit

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.420
that due to the front line police force's

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:30.030
extreme investigation, Mr. Kim Hyeong Bok has passed away.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.780
We will thoroughly investigate the cause of Mr. Kim Hyeong Bok's death

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.740
and be sure to hold them accountable.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.860
Hey.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.210
Hey, th-this. What are you going to do about this?

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:50.260
What else is there to do? We need to find Jeong Hui Joo's real murderer.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.990
That's not the problem. Right now, they're saying

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.510
the cause of Kim Hyeong Bok's death was our extreme investigation.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.700
- It's not totally wrong.
- What?

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.740
Hey.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.060
That happened because Kim Hyeong Bok was on the run. Why should we─

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.670
If the inspection team makes it a problem, blame it on me no matter what.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.780
All of you just need to say you were following my orders.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.930
You said you have debt from moving and opening a restaurant.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:14.670
How are you going to handle it if they hit you with a reduced pay penalty?

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:18.480
Don't worry about me and just worry about your life.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.730
Then how about this?

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:21.720
Out of all of us,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.580
to the person who is most affluent...

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.730
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.710
Out of us, I heard

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.150
there's a person who doesn't even know how much monthly pay he gets in his bank account.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.820
This isn't just about reduced pay. It also could cause problems with promotions.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.890
Honestly, is there anyone who doesn't care about promotions?

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.200
That only matters to people with dependents.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.610
Hyeong, do we have a person without a dependent here?

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:45.610
We do.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.910
I'm the first person who found out where Kim Hyeong Bok was.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:52.150
If someone should be accountable, I would be the first one in line.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.530
Stop embarrassing me.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.070
It'll look like I'm blaming the people beneath me for my own actions.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.350
Hyeongnim, beneath you?

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.830
You're a sergeant. He's a lieutenant.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.290
That's true. Who has the higher rank?

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.260
Detectives don't consider rank. It's about experience.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.030
Let's just conclude this by saying I'll be accountable.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.070
As we thought.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:16.000
As we thought.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.310
Hey, why are you intervening?

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.280
I rank than you, I'm richer, my education, handsomeness.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.240
I don't lack even a single thing.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.220
As we thought.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.950
Did your exhibition go well?

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.590
Yes.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.590
It had good intentions, but wouldn't people think we have lots of free time?

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.730
She worked hard.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.580
Think of it positively.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.770
Tae Ho, you're also too hasty.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.810
Excuse me?

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.820
Don't think of just covering the media with money.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:59.360
They also have a line of their own. If you cross that,

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.820
they'll run at you like a suicide team.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.240
I learned about it so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to figure things out.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.540
However, I believe it's a good enough warning to McQueen.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.700
I'll go to the broadcast station myself and make sure there aren't any misunderstandings.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.180
I think I gave you bad habits.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.020
You should at least

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.780
make your own bed that you slept in.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.230
Na Na, you messed up.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.920

Yes. We opened and checked it.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.340
But we can't open this for you.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.650
You don't need to.

Woo Tae Ho called Jeong Hui Joo that day.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.250
It's almost the exact time of the search and seizure.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:22.680
That means Woo Tae Ho told Jeong Hui Joo the passcode to the safe.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.220
And Jeong Hui Joo took something out of the safe.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.930
On the phone record, there's a name that I'm not a stranger to.

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.860
Who is it?

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.860
Someone I can't approach.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.400

She's not answering.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.880
Are there any other suspicious numbers?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.330
There's a number without an owner.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:17.620
I think it's a burner phone.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.190
Try calling.

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.570
I don't think I can go because I'm not feeling well.

She died because of me, right? Because I told Hui Joo about you.

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:30.560
Did you tell that to the detectives?

What's their relationship?

Could they connect the case from two years ago with the Jeong Hui Joo case?

Did you find the culprit for that case?

There's a person I'm suspicious of.

Send Na Na to America. It's better not to have her here.

This is just bullshit to try to lower the power of the investigation.

If you had incriminating evidence, I was willing to make a deal.
