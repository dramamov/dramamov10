(Episode 5)

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.915
Gosh.

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.709
The restroom.

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:25.421
Oh, geez.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:26.923
Goddamn it.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:32.804
What?

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:34.847
I'm sorry.

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.142
But he...

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:40.978
The restroom.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.775
Chan-hyuk, you can do it.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.943
You'll be fine.

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.362
Calm down.

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:50.988
Keep calm. You can do it.

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:19.141
Okay. All set.

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:40.996
Who's this?

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:43.457
Hello?

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.334
Who?

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.922
Tow my car?
But I parked it in the line.

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:51.507
Fine. I'll be right there.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.050
I'm on my way now.

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:54.927
Give me a second.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.221
If you touch my car,
I'll kill you.

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:32.506
Yu-ri.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.260
Someone left it in the restroom.

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:38.804
No sticky fingers.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.013
Put that back in there.

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.438
It's not just medicine, is it?

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:52.360
Put it back in there now.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:55.613
Okay, okay. I was going to.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:02:59.867
Who the hell is it?

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:06.874
What?

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.753
Shoot, where the hell is my bag?

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.047
What are you doing?

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:16.508
Where is it?

00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:18.134
Who took it?

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:29.730
Is that him?

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.776
Yes, that is him. I should've
arrested him back then.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.279
- Do you recognize him?
- You know him. Park Chan-hyuk.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:39.031
You said hi to him
in the hostess bar.

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:40.324
He may be a puppet boss,

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.410
but he'd still come out
to greet for a prosecutor.

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:56.465
We picked it up at the terminal.

00:03:58.551 --> 00:03:59.510
Wait.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.637
You don't know
who the bag belonged to?

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.058
He was lying
about who the bag belonged to.

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:11.689
I never said hi to
the hostess bar puppet boss.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.650
- Who owns it?
- Choi Geum-ho.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:16.485
The Purple supplier in Cheongju.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.238
You knew who was in the lead?

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:20.364
Then why haven't you caught him?

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.158
I was dumb for that reason.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:25.953
I won't waste my time in vain
anymore.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:29.081
Even if it means going against
prosecutors, we're busting Park.

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:30.416
Regardless of the warrant.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:31.834
Can you play it from the start?

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.048
Did anyone else request
that video aside from us?

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.132
No.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.720
Sir, please locate
Park Chan-hyuk immediately.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:46.307
What kids were selling is
indeed Purple.

00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:47.475
It belonged to Choi Geum-ho.

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.584
(Lee Jun-hyuk)

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.132
(Park Sung-woong)

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.651
(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:51.372
Who took it?

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.630
So the hostess bar was the hideout
for Cheongju junkies?

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:02.007
Serious enough for Jo Byung-gun
to reject the warrant.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.593
Yet, they lost the drug,

00:06:05.302 --> 00:06:06.679
and the kids took it.

00:06:08.597 --> 00:06:09.682
That's why...

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.435
It disappeared completely.

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:16.897
I'm telling you.
It's a simple supply issue.

00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:22.153
If it disappeared completely,

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:24.238
the puppet boss was lucky
that he didn't get killed.

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:27.532
The real boss must've made
so much fuss

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.952
when his seed money was gone.

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:33.329
Then the puppet boss found out

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.083
who took it

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:39.295
and who sold it.

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.054
Did you say you wanted to
buy it all?

00:06:57.146 --> 00:07:00.357
That makes more sense
than kids fighting.

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:02.651
Wait.

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:04.904
Because it was a lot of money,

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.698
the kids might have had
a conflict.

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:10.534
Then

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:15.122
he didn't retrieve the gun
from Yu-ri,

00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:17.458
but he kept it from the start
and shot her.

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:19.627
Only that explains it.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:22.713
Unless for one exception.

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:24.632
When you shoot the gun,

00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:26.508
you need to keep it tight
in your armpit.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:28.177
And load it.

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:29.803
Down here is the trigger,

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:31.639
and this is the safety.

00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:33.515
From the other side...

00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:36.644
Why doesn't it work?

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:39.521
An accidental shooting.

00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:42.983
No, was it accidental?

00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:45.194
But then

00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:54.203
it could've been the big buyer.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.789
That makes most people suspects.

00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:12.221
Geez, I'm stuck.

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:22.273
Right. One thing is clear.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:25.859
Whoever the murderer is,
the murderer is a drug dealer.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:27.736
Have you ever been in charge
of a drug case before?

00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:29.280
Sure.

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:32.283
That means Jo Byung-gun isn't
the only person taking the case.

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:34.618
If I catch the murderer

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.620
that happens to be a member
of a drug cartel?

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:39.999
Oh, perhaps the drugs might
come out of nowhere

00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:42.876
and change the direction
of the wind.

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.267
You must be tired.

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.352
Traveling here and there
several times a day.

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:04.148
This will be over tomorrow, right?

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:07.817
No new evidence.
The detention period is up.

00:09:07.942 --> 00:09:10.153
No additional charges.
He's good to go.

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.243
Thank you.

00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:17.911
- Sell what?
- Received orders via app...

00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:19.163
- The drug?
- At the terminal...

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:21.415
Did you receive orders through
the messenger on your phone?

00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:23.292
You sold drugs?

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:24.376
We weren't planning to do that.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.462
That's why I gave her the gun
in case she might get hurt.

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:32.301
Eat.

00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:36.513
You only had gukbap in there. Eat.

00:09:37.013 --> 00:09:38.098
Sir.

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.394
Your father came out of his way

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:44.855
to get you snacks.

00:09:47.024 --> 00:09:47.941
Here.

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.422
What did Seo Dong-jae say?
The prosecutor who visited you.

00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:16.136
Did he say you'll be fine?

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:23.352
Speak of the devil.

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:23.602
Speak of the devil.
Hey.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.272
You said you didn't know
who the bag belonged to.

00:10:31.443 --> 00:10:34.238
The terminal guy.
He found you, didn't he?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.324
Is he the one who said
he'd buy the rest?

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:39.535
Buy what?

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:41.578
I don't know.

00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:44.957
I wasn't there.

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:47.376
Come on. All you say is a lie.

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:49.753
Found the bag,
but don't know the owner.

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:51.922
The surveillance camera
caught everything.

00:10:52.047 --> 00:10:53.757
You stealing the bag

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:56.051
and taking off
when you knew who it belonged to.

00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:00.013
I didn't steal it.

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:03.100
What did you steal?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.480
If I'd told you I knew
who it belonged to,

00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:11.107
it'd be considered stealing. But

00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:14.653
Yu-ri went to sell it alone.
I swear I saw nothing.

00:11:14.778 --> 00:11:16.405
Wait.

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:20.284
Steal what and sell what?

00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:29.543
Your father is asking. Tell him.

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.340
Nam Gyeo-rye, did you

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.384
do anything?

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:44.348
Drugs.

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:46.727
Yes.

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:50.564
I'll let you meet him.

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:52.649
I'll bring the owner
of the bag in front of you

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:54.943
and tell him that you were the one
who stole his bag.

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:55.986
Wait here.

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:58.864
I'm adding the suspect's charges.

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.742
Suspicion of murder plus an
embezzlement of a lost property,

00:12:01.867 --> 00:12:03.285
and illegal drug trades.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.747
Hey. You can't do this to me.

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:08.499
Don't touch me.

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.836
That was a cliche.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:14.254
Seo...

00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:28.227
Sir.

00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:32.523
Is he doomed?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.149
Well...

00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:37.027
He's a first-timer and juvenile,

00:12:37.152 --> 00:12:38.820
but this isn't good timing.

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:42.241
For drug distribution, even
a first-timer is imprisoned...

00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:44.451
But...

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:46.286
Well...

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.539
Yu-ri went to sell it alone,
right?

00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:50.332
You never said you sold it, right?

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:51.959
Yes.

00:12:52.084 --> 00:12:54.545
No one saw it, right?
No one caught you, huh?

00:12:55.378 --> 00:12:56.213
Yes.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.923
Okay.

00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:00.050
What now?

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.636
In terms of the drug,

00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:05.180
conditional suspension
of prosecution is the best,

00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:08.392
but now that more charges are
added, the prosecutor--

00:13:08.517 --> 00:13:10.018
Did I not give you enough money

00:13:10.143 --> 00:13:11.853
or refuse to get you anything
you wanted?

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:14.523
What more did you need?
What did you lack?

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:22.531
Hey. I'll get you out of here.

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:24.783
- Can you do it? Can you?
- Yes. Of course.

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.285
When you get out of here,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.204
I'll kill your ass first. Got it?

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:30.998
You idiot...

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:51.935
My goodness.
What were you thinking?

00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:01.403
What happens

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:03.614
if anyone saw it?

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.743
What? What do you mean?

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:09.494
Selling drugs.

00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:11.455
What do I do?

00:14:11.913 --> 00:14:14.625
Did you get caught doing it?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.460
Please don't tell Dad.

00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:20.756
Who caught you?

00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:46.740
- Not the prosecution. To my home.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:50.911
Trust me, will you?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.579
Hello, boss.

00:14:52.704 --> 00:14:55.332
Hye-soo. Hyun-joo.
They're our VIPs, okay?

00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:57.417
- I'm counting on you.
- Okay.

00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:02.923
Tonight at 10:30 p.m..

00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:05.050
The second factory.

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:06.760
Nice location.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.348
My brother will get some fresh air

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.851
for the last time.

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:16.436
(Cheongju Prosecution Service)

00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:17.437
Hello?

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:34.871
Ma'am, about Im Yu-ri's case.

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:36.623
Have you found anything?

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.292
Nam Gyeo-rye

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:41.420
might not be the murderer.

00:15:42.504 --> 00:15:43.880
But...

00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:45.048
But?

00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:46.758
It's the drugs.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.055
Since when did Korea become
a drug country? A juvenile of all?

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.223
What drug?

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:54.433
Purple.

00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:58.520
I even found how Purple was
distributed until now.

00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:01.273
Express bus delivery.

00:16:01.398 --> 00:16:04.651
For bus delivery, the recipient
and sender can be written falsely,

00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:06.236
and no content check.

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:08.238
So it caused no issues

00:16:08.363 --> 00:16:09.823
until Park Chan-hyuk

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:12.284
left the drugs he received
in the restroom.

00:16:14.453 --> 00:16:15.412
Park Chan-hyuk...

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:18.248
The paper says the bar belongs
to Park Chan-hyuk...

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:21.460
What an idiot.
Why did he leave it there?

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:23.044
If he was just an idiot,
it wouldn't be a problem,

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.796
but Nam Gyeo-rye happened
to find it,

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.048
and he sold it with Im Yu-ri.

00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:29.676
Im Yu-ri's involved in this?

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:33.138
Yes, so I filled out
Park Chan-hyuk's warrant.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:34.681
Did you request it?

00:16:34.806 --> 00:16:36.850
No, I had to tell you first.

00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:39.394
Ma'am, Nam Gyeo-rye argues

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.772
Im Yu-ri went to
make her last deal alone.

00:16:41.897 --> 00:16:44.483
So far, the circumstances say
the last buyer is the culprit.

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:45.942
What says that's Park Chan-hyuk?

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:48.987
The possibility of finding out

00:16:49.112 --> 00:16:50.739
who resold his drugs

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:53.408
and pretending to buy drugs
in order to approach the kids.

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:54.701
You think there's none?

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:56.953
The evidence?
I'll need the warrant
to find the evidence.

00:16:57.496 --> 00:16:59.623
I'll need the warrant
to find the evidence.

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:05.796
The Purple is involved,
but it's your case.

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:07.130
Because he's a murder suspect.

00:17:07.798 --> 00:17:08.882
Yes.

00:17:09.007 --> 00:17:11.092
Did you come to see me first
asking for my support?

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:21.144
You must not leave out
your colleague.

00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.274
Prosecutor Jo isn't available
at the moment.

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:27.734
Where did he go?

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:29.569
Okay.

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:33.323
Ma'am, once I begin
searching him--

00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:35.033
Consider yourself lucky.
Request the warrant.

00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:35.700
Consider yourself lucky.
Request the warrant.
Thank you.

00:17:37.786 --> 00:17:38.829
Thank you.

00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:42.415
Ma'am, they're finally trading
Purple tonight.

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.210
Hey, get him.

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:46.711
- Get him?
- Get him.

00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:53.426
What?

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:55.095
I wouldn't know. Why?

00:17:58.181 --> 00:17:59.057
Okay.

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:01.101
(I'm heading now, Geum-ho.
I'll go check the place first)

00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:03.144
(What's the point? Let them do it)

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.145
(Everything?)

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:05.605
(We can't let
Mr. Won outnumber us)

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.731
(No way. Got it)

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:12.237
(Officer Park Geun-jung)

00:18:13.363 --> 00:18:15.782
Park Chan-hyuk is my snitch.

00:18:15.907 --> 00:18:17.701
They're making a deal
at 10 p.m. tonight.

00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:19.494
We can catch them all
in just two hours.

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:20.745
Do you want to make
the same mistake twice?

00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.122
See what happened when you let
the gangs go around with lumbers.

00:18:23.248 --> 00:18:25.125
So what?
They're about to make a deal.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.460
If we'd caught them back then,
they couldn't make a deal

00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:28.712
with no supplies.
We wouldn't have found any drugs.

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:30.797
Choi Geum-ho would've
gone off the grid for good.

00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:32.048
And you keep implying

00:18:32.173 --> 00:18:35.343
that the girl died because
I didn't approve the warrant.

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:37.596
This has no connection
to the hostess bar.

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:38.013
This has no connection
to the hostess bar.
Look.

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:40.848
He told me where and when
the deal will take place.

00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:43.518
You think he'd shoot the girl
for stealing his stuff?

00:18:43.643 --> 00:18:45.437
He has no reason to do that
before such an important deal.

00:18:45.562 --> 00:18:46.438
Unless he's an idiot.

00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:49.774
Unless he's an idiot,
you think he backed out quietly?

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.568
When he caught the thieves,
they pointed a gun at him.

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:53.194
You think he still decided
to let them slide?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.155
'The deal is coming up.
I shouldn't cause any trouble.'

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.407
'They saw my face, but I'll still
let them walk away alive.'

00:18:57.531 --> 00:18:59.074
- Is that what you're saying?
- Im Yu-ri is dead already.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.076
Hey, how can you say that
right now?

00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:03.079
If we ransack them now,
Choi will never make a deal again.

00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:04.956
There is no second chance.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.916
Didn't I tell you?

00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:08.001
A Purple supplier named Mr. Kang
lives in Seoul.

00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:09.753
I'll catch Choi to catch Mr. Kang

00:19:09.878 --> 00:19:11.379
and everyone above him.

00:19:11.504 --> 00:19:13.422
Including the one who made
the drugs and the producer.

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:16.176
That's the only way to prevent
victims like Yu-ri.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.136
Purple is very serious.

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:21.181
This is our last chance
before it spreads in the country.

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:23.183
We might not be able to
save the world,

00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:25.644
but we can get rid of this drug.

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:29.147
Mr. Seo, put yourself in my shoes.

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:30.690
Forget about how much effort
I put into this and all

00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:33.318
because that's my issue.

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:34.903
We only have two hours left.

00:19:35.028 --> 00:19:36.446
If you were me, would you let me
search him

00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:38.197
regardless of the deal?

00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:40.867
What would you have said
if I interfered with your case?

00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:44.703
Ma'am,

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:47.248
when you approved
the warrant earlier,

00:19:47.374 --> 00:19:48.959
you saw its connection
to the murder.

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:51.544
Is Park the murderer? Then we must
arrest him. Let's go arrest him.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.130
But he must be the murderer
at all cost.

00:19:54.255 --> 00:19:55.173
If not,

00:19:55.298 --> 00:19:57.175
if you're ruining my case
based on your speculations,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.844
I won't let it slide.
I'm filing a complaint officially.

00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:03.181
Mr. Seo, are you sure
Park Chan-hyuk did it?

00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.185
Where is it?

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.685
Seowon. A cement factory.

00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:10.563
To come up with a strategy
and sneak in there before them,

00:20:10.689 --> 00:20:11.856
we don't have much time left.

00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:13.858
Prosecutor Seo.

00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:15.026
Request the warrant.

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:15.902
Ma'am.

00:20:16.027 --> 00:20:17.404
Including Choi Geum-ho.

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:20.198
Upon raiding them,
raid their houses, businesses,

00:20:20.323 --> 00:20:22.283
and everything they have.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.911
The drug and Im Yu-ri's murder.

00:20:25.036 --> 00:20:26.705
- We're investing them together.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:29.124
- No, we're not investing--
- They go together.

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.042
Don't miss any one of them.

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:33.336
- Get all prosecutors ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:50.478
Shoot.

00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:54.607
I'm just a hostess bar owner.

00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:57.777
From 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.
is the peak hours.

00:20:57.902 --> 00:21:00.488
What else would I do in that time?
Work, obviously.

00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:03.491
Are you saying you were at work
the whole time?

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:05.035
From 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.?

00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:09.372
What on earth had happened
that you have to do this to me?

00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:14.419
(Summoning all VCU members.
Crime tip-off received)

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:17.005
Shoot.

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:26.014
That's none of your business.
Give me your hand.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:27.849
Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

00:21:27.974 --> 00:21:29.017
Why?

00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:30.393
Right-handed, aren't you?

00:21:32.352 --> 00:21:34.438
Yes, I am.

00:21:34.564 --> 00:21:35.857
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

00:21:35.982 --> 00:21:38.358
- Tell me what you're doing.
- Stay still.

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:39.986
Shoot.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:43.948
Damn it.

00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:50.163
The summon announcement
is about them.

00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:52.164
- Choi Geum-ho's drug deal.
- What?

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:54.167
This is messed up.

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:55.585
What the hell are you doing?

00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:02.801
(Detective Team 1
to the captain's office now)

00:22:09.389 --> 00:22:10.892
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes?

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:13.810
Don't come forward.
Just stand behind me.

00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:15.980
- You won't have to--
- You'll break something.

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:17.398
Oh.

00:22:21.194 --> 00:22:22.070
What's the youngest doing?
You should prepare
for the meeting.

00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:23.905
You should prepare
for the meeting.

00:22:24.656 --> 00:22:25.531
Yes.

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:34.665
Prosecutor Jo said

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.252
you don't have to come
if you don't feel like it.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.671
Oh.

00:22:42.507 --> 00:22:44.926
I'm only delivering the message.
Bye.

00:22:46.177 --> 00:22:47.262
Wait.

00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:51.141
Take care of Sung Si-woon.
Make sure he doesn't come forward.

00:22:52.183 --> 00:22:53.268
You should be careful too.

00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:02.360
It's a matter of going to the
supreme office to Prosecutor Jo.

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:07.824
The supreme office?

00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:09.951
Mr. Jo is aiming at DEA
in the supreme office.

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:12.370
That will only hurt him.

00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:13.580
There are drugs everywhere.

00:23:13.705 --> 00:23:16.166
Solving a single case outside
the city won't get him there.

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:19.419
Because there are drugs
everywhere, they're always hiring.

00:23:19.544 --> 00:23:21.421
Some people make it at once
by smashing a drug cartel

00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:23.047
outside the city
at times like this.

00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:25.175
And some people become bystanders.

00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:36.977
Some are bound to be successful.

00:23:37.937 --> 00:23:39.939
The deal happens
to take place now.

00:23:43.318 --> 00:23:44.819
Does that mean I'm not bound
to be successful?

00:23:46.321 --> 00:23:48.489
Sir, locate Park Chan-hyuk
immediately.

00:23:52.827 --> 00:23:53.786
Yes, detective.

00:23:54.161 --> 00:23:56.915
Do you have Park Chan-hyuk
with you right now?

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:59.042
If we set him free now,
he'll take off for sure.

00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:00.293
We've been questioning him
until now.

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:01.920
Even if we set him free,
he wouldn't go make a deal.

00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:05.548
So, if you let him go,
he'd try to get rid of evidence.

00:24:05.673 --> 00:24:06.799
If he is the murderer.

00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:11.596
- You said something came up.
- No, nothing.

00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.097
How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:15.516
Tail him?
As if we're letting him go?

00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:17.977
Yes, but make sure
not to miss him.

00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:19.103
Don't worry about that.

00:24:20.855 --> 00:24:22.565
Oh, what about the kids' phones?

00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:23.942
Come in.

00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:25.610
Yes, the last buyer.

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:27.362
We're analyzing it,
but it's not easy.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.906
Okay.

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:34.702
Bye.

00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:41.875
That dead girl talked my boy
into it. That sly girl.

00:24:43.002 --> 00:24:46.339
I mean, it's not his fault
that he met a wrong friend.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.092
My son's so timid

00:24:49.217 --> 00:24:51.259
that I'm always worried about

00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:52.971
how to make him a man.

00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:54.555
And are you saying he sold drugs?

00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:56.266
Why is she the only one dead
if they did it together?

00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.059
That's just who she was.

00:24:58.558 --> 00:24:59.686
Will you keep it down?

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.397
What a lowlife every time.

00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:04.564
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:25:15.492 --> 00:25:16.535
Please.

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:19.914
Release him.

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:25.669
He's timid.
He's different from me.

00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:28.089
Please help him,
so he won't ruin his life.

00:25:28.631 --> 00:25:29.632
Please.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.509
Here.

00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:39.600
I swear I won't bother you again
with the land issue.

00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:42.687
Rip that up
and let my son go, please?

00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:46.858
Your son Nam Gyeo-rye

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.987
had a wrong father,
not a wrong friend.

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:53.865
You can make it a conditional
suspension of prosecution.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.867
- Release him.
- The murderer hasn't been caught.

00:25:55.992 --> 00:25:57.285
He's not the murderer!

00:26:02.623 --> 00:26:04.249
The murderer hasn't been
caught yet.

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:06.586
Who'd be the next target?

00:26:07.587 --> 00:26:10.465
Your son sold
a drug cartel's drugs.

00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:13.718
Consider he's in the safest place
right now.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.722
If you release him, I'll make sure
he doesn't set a foot outside.

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:19.724
You should've guarded the gun.

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:21.642
You didn't even know he took it.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:26.564
What was it that you said?

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:29.067
'You can't do this to me?'

00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:30.443
That's what I want to say.

00:26:33.613 --> 00:26:34.614
What are you doing?

00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:37.533
Leave.

00:27:04.018 --> 00:27:05.103

A copy? Shoot.

00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:13.027
Geez, nothing ever works out.

00:27:14.695 --> 00:27:15.655
Fine.

00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:19.367
Hide behind that door.

00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:22.912
Once you're out,

00:27:23.996 --> 00:27:25.248
you're dead.

00:27:33.297 --> 00:27:35.258
Sir, there was a witness.

00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:38.970
Gyeo-rye thinks it was
the owner of the bag.

00:27:39.095 --> 00:27:40.346
The witness of him
selling the drug.

00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:42.640
He found Gyeo-rye in the end

00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:43.975
and the girl too.

00:27:45.143 --> 00:27:47.103
He never said Yu-ri got caught.

00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:48.229
It doesn't matter.

00:27:48.354 --> 00:27:50.231
It's time for us to find him.

00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:52.442
How?

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.659
The new amphetamine type ecstasy

00:28:01.784 --> 00:28:02.618
so called Purple.

00:28:02.743 --> 00:28:05.037
The buyer is Kim Ki-won
also known as Mr. Won.

00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:06.747
The only entrance to the location

00:28:06.873 --> 00:28:09.959
is West North IC entrance
and Gyodong-ri route.

00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:13.045
0.8km from the factory
to the entrance is off-road.

00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:14.714
They may speed
as much as they want.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:17.341
Please block
all the possible escape routes.

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:18.926
Choi Geum-ho's clique is
the distribution channel,

00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:20.678
and Mr. Won's clique is
supplier channel.

00:28:20.803 --> 00:28:21.929
They'll all be there.

00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:23.556
Please capture them all alive.

00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:25.183

Are you Ms. Im Yu-ri's father?

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:37.129
I'm Nam Gyeo-rye's father.

00:29:37.713 --> 00:29:40.424
I'm ashamed to meet you.

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:45.012
I should've visited you earlier,
but my son

00:29:45.137 --> 00:29:46.514
was framed.

00:29:47.098 --> 00:29:48.641
I had no courage to visit you.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.810
Fortunately, the
misunderstanding's been resolved.

00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:52.687
So I'm here belatedly.

00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:57.775
Framed, did you say?

00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:00.611
Now that you know

00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:03.197
how my daughter ended up
like that,

00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:06.284
are you saying your son
has nothing to do with this?

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:09.328
The misunderstanding's
been resolved?

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.457
I mean,
the murderer's been arrested.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.376
What do you mean?

00:30:16.043 --> 00:30:17.420
Says who?

00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:19.714
The police.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:22.508
He's a member
of Cheongju drug cartel.

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:24.885
The kids should've known better

00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:27.513
than getting their hands
on a gang's drugs.

00:30:27.638 --> 00:30:28.347
What?

00:30:28.472 --> 00:30:30.975
It sounds like he was looking
for our kids.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.476
Even the prosecutor said

00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:35.313
my son was the next target.

00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:39.150
Cheongju drug cartel?

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:40.234
Yes.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:45.406
I thought you'd know
since you're an officer.

00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:54.832
Hey, is it true?
Do we have the suspect?

00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:56.542
Park Chan-hyuk?

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.171
From the hostess bar
in Yulryang-dong?

00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:06.385
Why didn't you tell me?

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.387
Why did you keep it to yourselves?

00:31:08.512 --> 00:31:11.098
If you'd known,
you'd go after him with a knife.

and get that Park...

about Park Chan-hyuk?

No.

00:31:34.997 --> 00:31:36.832

No, something came up in the bar.

Okay.

You were being too outright.

Do you want to exclude
Seo Dong-jae that badly?

00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:38.287
It was him who tried to
exclude me first.

- Let's go.
- Yes, boss.

Let's go.

00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:31.877

00:36:54.525 --> 00:36:55.609
Go, boss.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.251
Jae-beom.

00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:16.505
Freeze.

00:37:48.412 --> 00:37:50.956
No. Don't step on it.

00:38:10.017 --> 00:38:11.310
Let me go.

00:38:13.604 --> 00:38:15.021
I'll kill them all.

00:38:15.647 --> 00:38:17.106
Choi Geum-ho!

00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:19.693
Choi Geum-ho! You son of a gun!

00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:31.455
Drop your weapons.

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:44.134
No.

00:38:47.638 --> 00:38:48.806
Shoot.

00:38:57.439 --> 00:38:58.607
Is he in there?

00:39:04.738 --> 00:39:05.739
Sir.

00:39:08.117 --> 00:39:09.118
It's blood.

00:39:22.965 --> 00:39:26.009
A car theft 300m
from Gyodong-ri route.

00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:27.928
A man appeared out of nowhere
and stole the car.

00:39:28.052 --> 00:39:29.555
It is assumed to be Choi Geum-ho.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.850
The license plate number is
371S 1170.

00:40:03.297 --> 00:40:07.509
(Gunsam Sauna)

00:40:11.263 --> 00:40:12.723
- Hello?
- Kim Ki-won's arrested.

00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:14.808
Choi Geum-ho took off.

00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:16.602
The roads are blocked
for investigation,

00:40:16.727 --> 00:40:18.395
so we're returning to the office.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.023
So? Did Park Chan-hyuk show up?

00:40:21.148 --> 00:40:22.482
No, I didn't see him.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.319
Really?

00:40:25.444 --> 00:40:26.904
Where are you, sir?

00:40:27.987 --> 00:40:30.657
At first, I never thought
it'd be a gunshot.

00:40:30.782 --> 00:40:32.700
I thought something exploded.

00:40:34.453 --> 00:40:36.663
My house is right in the back.

00:40:36.788 --> 00:40:38.498
So I came to check
to prevent any fire,

00:40:38.624 --> 00:40:40.417
and the door was open.

00:40:43.003 --> 00:40:43.879
Where is it?

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:49.968
- It's toxic.
- What's toxic?

00:40:57.559 --> 00:40:59.561
We've found so many ingredients
for ecstasy.

00:40:59.686 --> 00:41:00.687
They were enough to make

00:41:00.811 --> 00:41:02.981
a dose for 20,000 people.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.526
How can they do this
in a residential area?

00:41:18.247 --> 00:41:19.206
Prosecutor Seo.

00:41:29.507 --> 00:41:31.760
It matches the serial number
on Nam Wan-seong's gun.

00:41:32.427 --> 00:41:33.470
Look at this.

00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:42.019
It's purple.

00:41:42.145 --> 00:41:43.397
It is in purple color.
That means...

00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:45.274
It was inside the victim's mouth.

00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:49.819
He probably didn't take the drug
like that. How did he...

00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:52.197
His name is Kang Soo-min.
His address is in Seoul.

00:41:52.322 --> 00:41:53.448
He has no criminal record.

00:41:55.158 --> 00:41:56.910
Why is it Purple everywhere I go?

00:41:57.786 --> 00:42:01.039
This seems to be the Purple plant.

00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:07.129
Is he the plant owner?

00:42:07.713 --> 00:42:09.715
A Purple supplier named Mr. Kang
lives in Seoul.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.133
Mr. Kang? Kang Soo-min?

00:42:11.258 --> 00:42:13.218
- No.
- What?

00:42:13.343 --> 00:42:15.804
The plant operator is
different from the producer.

00:42:16.388 --> 00:42:17.389
Wait.

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:20.892
Did the reporter leave?

00:42:23.145 --> 00:42:24.770
I'll catch Choi to catch Mr. Kang

00:42:24.896 --> 00:42:26.355
and everyone above him.

00:42:26.898 --> 00:42:27.941
Mr. Kang.

00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:40.329
Kang Soo-min. The supplier.

00:42:52.257 --> 00:42:53.884
We've missed Choi Geum-ho,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.845
and Mr. Kang is here.

00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:01.016
It's not Purple everywhere I go.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.978
We've found so many ingredients
for ecstasy.

00:43:05.103 --> 00:43:07.397
A dose for 20,000 people.

00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:08.857
It's my case.

00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:12.735
If my case busts Purple plant,
distributor channel,

00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:15.030
and the producer,

00:43:15.155 --> 00:43:17.699
who smashed the drug cartel
outside the city?

00:43:17.824 --> 00:43:21.161
Who can plan to move
to the supreme office now?

00:43:24.873 --> 00:43:26.166
The model prosecutor.

00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:28.043
Seo Dong-jae.

00:43:32.546 --> 00:43:33.673
That's not all.

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:34.758
Get him out.

00:43:34.883 --> 00:43:36.968
The land and everything.

00:43:38.178 --> 00:43:39.596
I'll call them all off, yeah?

00:43:39.721 --> 00:43:40.847
What if it's serial murders?

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.392
If Nam Gyeo-rye isn't
the murderer,

00:43:43.975 --> 00:43:45.394
I will release him.

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:48.105
Not because of outside pressure,

00:43:49.022 --> 00:43:50.982
but because I solved the case
by myself.

00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:00.784
This will not only change
the direction of the wind,

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.870
but my life.
