Be quiet. Come with us in peace.

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:22.188
Hey, stop.

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:31.864
Shoot.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.199
Stay still.

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:34.784
Stop moving.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:39.205
Is the person who ordered you
to kill and bury Park Jung-woo

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.125
in this court right now?

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:43.751
Yes.

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:45.795
Was he at the scene
of the murder as well?

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.133
Yes.

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:52.718
Can you point at him?

00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:04.897
Can you tell me the name
of the man you're pointing at?

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:06.732
Nam Wan-seong.

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:09.110
He ordered us to kill him.

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:14.740
Mr. Nam, this is what you said
during the investigation.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.702
Yes, he was my secretary.

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:19.912
And those who ran away
worked for me.

00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:21.622
I didn't deny that.

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.374
But how can you blame me

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.960
when they killed a man
and buried the body themselves?

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:27.253
It doesn't make any sense.

00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:31.090
Why did you kill him
if he didn't order you?

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:33.176
I didn't do it.

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:35.219
I only went to
the construction site

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:38.014
because of my boss' order.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.892
I didn't know what was there.

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.312
You didn't know what was buried

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:46.230
in the construction site?

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:49.442
I swear, sir.

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:50.693
In May, you knew

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:54.280
Park Jung-woo was buried in
the construction site, didn't you?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.616
No.

00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.909
Make sure he's not found.

00:03:58.492 --> 00:03:59.243
Help.

00:03:59.368 --> 00:04:02.038
It's not like I was there

00:04:02.163 --> 00:04:04.248
or witnessed anything.

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:05.833
How am I supposed to know?

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.127
Moving it

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:11.505
could be shooting myself
in the foot.

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:14.342
Grind it on the spot.

00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:15.927
Yes, sir.

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:25.269
You think that makes sense?

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:28.314
Here.

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:30.358
These men.

00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:33.861
Did you take them
to the construction site?

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:35.738
Yes.

00:04:35.863 --> 00:04:36.906
And

00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:39.325
these machines.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.329
Did you use them
on the construction site?

00:04:51.128 --> 00:04:52.171
Did you?

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.008
Yes.

00:04:57.635 --> 00:04:59.720
You didn't know
what was buried there,

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:02.265
yet you took the cement breaker.

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:05.476
Because I was told
to break the cement.

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:08.104
- CEO Nam...
- What about the grinder?

00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.024
That was...

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.317
I'm ashamed to say this,

00:05:14.068 --> 00:05:15.528
but I thought I succeeded.

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:17.946
Is this the only way?

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:21.701
Tell him that
if he drops the charges,

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:24.287
he won't have to labor
for the rest of his life.

00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:25.454
Yes, sir.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:36.132
What made you think you succeeded?

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:38.068
Because Park Jung-woo
accepted the money

00:05:38.092 --> 00:05:41.136
and promised to leave Cheongju.

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:42.305
Well done.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.472
Thank you.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.434
After that,

00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:49.186
I never saw Park Jung-woo again.

00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.814
So I thought it was over.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.027
Until all these years,
I solved all issues with money,

00:05:56.152 --> 00:05:57.945
and I thought this was the same.

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:00.323
When the rumor spread later,

00:06:00.448 --> 00:06:03.367
I thought people were

00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:04.702
just gossiping.

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:06.912
I'm sorry.

00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.415
What rumor?

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.170
That I harmed Park Jung-woo.

00:06:14.295 --> 00:06:17.089
You were investigated
multiple times until now.

00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:20.009
But how come you never mentioned
about the money?

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:21.260
Your honor.

00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:24.138
May I explain that?

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:26.515
Sure.

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:29.852
The defendant

00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:32.204
tried to confess whether
to the prosecutors or the police

00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:35.231
that he paid late Park.

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:37.693
And it was me who stopped him.

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.779
I told him not to confess.

00:06:39.904 --> 00:06:42.782
Because it was obvious
his intention would be misused.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.950
Why would it be misused?

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.828
I request a witness

00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.205
to show how it'd been misused.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:55.711
Nam Wan-seong requested
Park Chan-hyuk as a witness.

00:06:56.587 --> 00:06:59.507
What? Does Park Chan-hyuk
have something to do with that?

00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:01.425
- No.
- Then why?

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.719
He took back his testimony.
Nothing's in their favor.

00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:05.971
I thought it was strange,

00:07:06.097 --> 00:07:07.890
but I can see what he's thinking.

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:11.602
So everything you said
during the drug trial

00:07:11.727 --> 00:07:12.812
was perjury?

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.398
Because Nam Wan-seong
threatened you,

00:07:15.523 --> 00:07:17.483
you testified that
you didn't know Nam Gyeo-rye?

00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:19.527
Is that what you mean?

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:22.321
Yes.

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:24.824
That man over there.

00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:32.915
He threatened to kill me

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.000
just because I saw his son

00:07:37.002 --> 00:07:38.421
selling drugs.

00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:40.589
What else could I do?

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.343
How did you witness him
selling drugs?

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:48.556
Because you are the supplier.

00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.723
Am I right?

00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:56.147
You were arrested and detained
for selling drugs, weren't you?

00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:59.376
You were in the detention center
until recently, weren't you?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.627
You were in the detention center
until recently, weren't you?
What about now?

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:03.112
Did you come from
the detention center?

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.073
No.

00:08:06.407 --> 00:08:08.409
He's the biggest problem.

00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:10.744
I can pretend to be someone

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.079
who can't even kill a bug.

00:08:12.204 --> 00:08:13.289
A letter of apology?

00:08:13.414 --> 00:08:14.832
I can write hundreds of them.

00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:16.667
But once Park Chan-hyuk blabbers

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:20.254
about how I threatened him
to death,

00:08:20.713 --> 00:08:22.047
everything goes to waste.

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:24.550
But

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:27.678
it's not like I could retrieve
what he said.

00:08:27.803 --> 00:08:30.181
If you received two apartment
units, you should.

00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:33.893
You must refute any testimony

00:08:34.018 --> 00:08:35.769
to make yourself worthwhile
as an attorney.

00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:42.276
There's nothing I can do
when he's already set free.

00:08:45.488 --> 00:08:47.948
Free? Park Chan-hyuk?

00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:49.116
Yes.

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:55.080
So he's set free?

00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:57.976
Cheongju prosecutors set
the drug offender Park free

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.711
without a trial who spread
a new type of drug

00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:02.922
and even got students addicted

00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:06.550
when that wasn't even
his first offense.

00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:08.093
When was that?

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:10.513
When do you think that happened?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.102
It was the very day
the witness testified

00:09:17.228 --> 00:09:20.064
that Nam Wan-seong threatened him.

00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:23.859
The prosecutors charged
the defendant of proxy murder,

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:26.946
but they knew there was
no direct evidence.

00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:30.282
Then they changed their direction.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.119
If the witness was threatened
to death...

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.331
Only if they could frame

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:39.040
the defendant

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:41.835
a man who habitually
threatens others' lives

00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:44.379
when there was
no evidence or no witness

00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:46.382
to prove the defendant's crime.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.803
Mr. Park.

00:09:52.054 --> 00:09:54.515
Did the prosecutors offer
to set you free

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.849
if you change your testimony?

00:10:01.772 --> 00:10:02.648
That was...

00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:05.609
That you've never met
Nam Wan-seong before.

00:10:05.734 --> 00:10:07.820
The drug seller was Im Yu-ri.

00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:10.114
Cheongju detective captain's
daughter Im Yu-ri

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:11.740
sold drugs.

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:14.285
That was his first testimony;

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.703
however, as soon as he testified
against the defendant,

00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:18.122
he was set free.

00:10:18.247 --> 00:10:19.540
Is that a coincidence?

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:21.417
No, right?

00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:25.254
Did the prosecutors order you?

00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:33.470
Witness, stop dragging on
and answer him.

00:10:39.893 --> 00:10:41.145
They did, but...

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.731
The prosecutor who offered
to set you free.

00:10:43.856 --> 00:10:45.274
Kidnapped you,

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.734
tortured you.

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:48.295
His name.
That's all you need to say.

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:49.445
That's all you need to say.

00:10:50.194 --> 00:10:51.488
Was it Seo Dong-jae?

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:56.744
He requested one more witness
along with Park Chan-hyuk.

00:10:57.745 --> 00:10:58.787
You.

00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:02.416
Nam Wan-seong requested you
as a witness.

00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:05.294
Currently in Cheongju,
his biggest anti-fans are

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:08.339
Park Chan-hyuk and you.

00:11:08.464 --> 00:11:10.549
And you two happen to be
the defendants' witnesses.

00:11:10.716 --> 00:11:12.091
What we have in common is

00:11:12.217 --> 00:11:14.428
that he clearly has something
on us.

00:11:17.014 --> 00:11:18.140
The difference is...

00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:25.814
You'd make Park Chan-hyuk
stand in the trial

00:11:25.898 --> 00:11:28.400
even if Nam Wan-seong
doesn't bother.

00:11:28.524 --> 00:11:31.445
But they know I wouldn't make you
stand in the trial.

00:11:32.363 --> 00:11:34.948
Yet if they're dragging me
into this,

00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:36.492
they think it'd favor him.

00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:39.328
They're not making things worse,

00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:40.871
but I have a lot to offer to them.

00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:49.338
I can see what I have for them,

00:11:54.134 --> 00:11:55.636
But no one knows whether
that will be

00:11:56.637 --> 00:11:58.222
a game-changer for them or us.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.184
What do you do for a living?

00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:06.271
I'm a prosecutor
from Cheongju District Office.

00:12:06.397 --> 00:12:07.439
Your name?

00:12:07.523 --> 00:12:08.732
Seo Dong-jae.

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:09.900
No.

00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:13.278
Don't you know your name
and what you do for a living?

00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:15.489
You're a construction site laborer

00:12:15.614 --> 00:12:17.116
Hwang Si-mok.

00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:20.536
A man named Hwang Si-mok was

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.788
hired
as a construction site laborer.

00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:25.541
He hovered around
a prohibited area

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:27.876
and kept questioning
about the construction site.

00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:29.712
He acted strange.

00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:32.172
It's the testimony the labor
team manager made

00:12:32.297 --> 00:12:35.676
after confirming
Seo Dong-jae's face.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.593
Mr. Seo.

00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:40.740
The laborer Hwang Si-mok
that's mentioned in the testimony.

00:12:40.764 --> 00:12:41.890
Is that you?

00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:43.225
Yes.

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:45.436
Concealing yourself
with a fake name

00:12:45.561 --> 00:12:48.439
and ransacking the construction
site as if you were a laborer

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:49.773
is all true?

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:51.191
Yes.

00:12:51.984 --> 00:12:53.026
You're all aware

00:12:53.152 --> 00:12:55.612
of what happened between
Prosecutor Seo

00:12:55.738 --> 00:12:57.406
from Cheongju District
and the defendant.

00:12:57.531 --> 00:12:59.533
I don't need to explain that.

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:01.618
Because it's already so famous.

00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:04.204
He manipulated evidence

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:06.498
and framed a young man
as a culprit.

00:13:06.623 --> 00:13:09.251
A prosecutor
who committed a great sin

00:13:09.376 --> 00:13:11.253
tried to get back
at the defendant

00:13:11.378 --> 00:13:13.672
for revealing the truth

00:13:13.797 --> 00:13:17.050
by sneaking into his work
pretending to be a laborer.

00:13:17.384 --> 00:13:18.427
Your honor.

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:23.974
I asked Prosecutor Seo

00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:26.185
to work at the construction site.

00:13:27.603 --> 00:13:29.372
I was in charge of the case
since Park Jung-woo

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:32.191
reported Ehong Construction's
construction corruption.

00:13:32.316 --> 00:13:35.319
With a belief that him going
missing shouldn't be neglected,

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:38.155
I discussed how to prove it
with my fellow prosecutor Seo.

00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:40.032
Here is the point.

00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:44.411
The defendant did not
fall for a trap.

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.372
Because the person who buried
the body in the construction site

00:13:47.498 --> 00:13:49.249
isn't anyone
but the defendant himself.

00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:53.337
Yes. That is my point.

00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:56.757
Someone buried a body
in the construction site.

00:13:56.882 --> 00:14:00.135
I am not denying the body
wasn't found there.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.472
You're insisting that
it was the defendant's doing.

00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:05.975
Without single evidence,
you assumed it was a proxy murder

00:14:06.099 --> 00:14:08.602
and were arrogant enough
to conclude it.

00:14:08.727 --> 00:14:10.854
Where did that great evil

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.315
come from?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.153
Why did prosecutors
conspire, join hands,

00:14:18.278 --> 00:14:19.988
and lie?

00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:23.116
And why did it happen to be
Prosecutor Seo of all people?

00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:26.662
Why is that? Huh?

00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:30.457
They're trying to show no one
should mess with prosecutors.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.126
If you neglect this,

00:14:33.252 --> 00:14:35.420
we civilians cannot say a word

00:14:35.546 --> 00:14:37.047
despite what prosecutors do.

00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:39.967
Your honor.

00:14:40.384 --> 00:14:42.094
I dare to say

00:14:42.469 --> 00:14:44.847
among all his testimony
he made in this trial,

00:14:44.972 --> 00:14:48.433
nothing was true.

00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:01.864
How should I prove it?

00:15:06.326 --> 00:15:08.453
If you cannot trust my testimony,

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.665
who knows the concrete truth?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.417
And even if the truth is said,

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.586
can anyone be free

00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.297
from objection

00:15:18.422 --> 00:15:19.798
regardless of the side they take?

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:24.720
I kept asking myself
for the answer.

00:15:34.646 --> 00:15:37.232
Geez, it's already
been overwritten.

00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:38.567
What's been overwritten?

00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:41.528
Nam Wan-seong's dashcam.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:43.363
There's nothing since May.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.658
So much for May.

00:15:46.783 --> 00:15:49.036
It starts from September
this year.

00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.872
If it's been deleted on purpose,
we can retrieve it,

00:15:51.997 --> 00:15:53.957
but if it's been overwritten,
we have no chance.

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:57.169
Was it December 5
when Nam Wan-seong got arrested?

00:15:57.294 --> 00:15:58.938
Yes, that's when we went to
the construction site.

00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:00.964
Then someone occurred to me.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.929
Nam Wan-seong's biggest traitor.

00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:11.934
Dad?

00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:17.898
Is this Nam Wan-seong's
corporation car dashcam?

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.318
I took it from his car
in his garage.

00:16:23.153 --> 00:16:26.156
It stops after December 6.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.743
Because he was arrested
on the 5th.

00:16:29.868 --> 00:16:32.120
Even if he didn't drive it,

00:16:32.245 --> 00:16:34.289
it would've kept recording.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.292
Unless someone turned it off
on purpose.

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:39.461
Then was it turned off on purpose?

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:41.772
Who would do that? There's no one
but his kid at home.

00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:44.675
Even if there was, they couldn't
have afforded to think about it.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.985
Someone was worried
about the battery dying

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:48.345
when his family was arrested.

00:16:49.012 --> 00:16:50.973
Yet he meddled with the dashcam.

00:16:52.474 --> 00:16:53.517
Why?

00:16:54.434 --> 00:16:55.978
It wouldn't disfavor him,

00:16:56.103 --> 00:16:57.604
but why did he still delete it?

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:02.401
Did someone get in the car?

00:17:06.697 --> 00:17:07.739
Whose hand is that?

00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:10.993
Nam Gyeo-rye?

00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:15.122
Why did he meddle
with his dad's car?

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.583
He ordered his son
to delete the dashcam footage?

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:20.669
Listen carefully.

00:17:21.253 --> 00:17:23.255
You'll see my car key on my desk.

00:17:23.964 --> 00:17:27.050
See if the dashcam footage
from May is still there.

00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:28.552
May?

00:17:29.302 --> 00:17:30.804
It's probably been deleted,

00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:32.305
but check again.

00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:34.558
They'll soon come back
with a search warrant.

00:17:37.436 --> 00:17:39.563
I found the car key. What now?

00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:43.108
Next to the power button on the
side, you'll see the memory card.

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.277
If the footage from May is still
there, delete it.

00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:46.570
If not, put it back in.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.364
Don't tell anyone about it.

00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:50.907
Not even the attorney.

00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:53.035
Check it yourself.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.286
Your honor.

00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:57.748
That was the call he had
with his son in jail.

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:01.626
Why do you think he emphasized
to delete the footage from May?

00:18:02.252 --> 00:18:04.755
Because in May when the victim
was buried alive,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.633
the defendant was at the scene
of murder.

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:10.969
That is basically a confession.

00:18:11.094 --> 00:18:13.055
Jail also counts
as a correctional facility.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.348
Were you not aware
that all calls in the facility

00:18:15.474 --> 00:18:17.601
were recorded?

00:18:31.323 --> 00:18:33.158
I wasn't, goddamn it.

00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:35.660
What did you just say?

00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:39.706
Defendant,
with an attitude like that...

00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:42.125
I'm not a kid.

00:18:44.002 --> 00:18:47.005
What's wrong with my attitude?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.216
Why do I have to be polite? Why?

00:18:49.341 --> 00:18:51.343
Because you committed a crime
and stood in trial!

00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:58.058
You.

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:00.811
Among the judges and prosecutors,

00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:03.021
I already know several

00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.524
who deserve to sit here.

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:10.112
Stop acting up.

00:19:11.113 --> 00:19:12.948
Our titles may be different,

00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:15.492
but you and I...

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:17.552
Close your mouth and sit down.

00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:19.555
Charging people unfairly
however you like wasn't enough,

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:21.289
you only favor people
from the same field.

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:24.583
And yet you say you can punish me?

00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:26.503
Says who?

00:19:28.004 --> 00:19:29.589
Don't touch me. I said let go!

00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.092
I will announce the date
for the next trial later.

00:19:32.217 --> 00:19:33.426
The court has been dismissed.

00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:52.070
Enough with your bullcrap.

00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:55.365
I had to do something.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.973
If Nam Gyeo-rye is the one
who took the dashcam memory,

00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:04.040
there's only one person
who'd order him.

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:05.542
The day after his arrest,

00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:07.794
he was in jail.

00:20:09.588 --> 00:20:10.672
Nam Wan-seong, that prick.

00:20:20.097 --> 00:20:22.934
You think he felt refreshed after
raising his voice in the court?

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:25.187
Or did he regret
about not holding it back?

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.646
He probably regretted it

00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:29.816
when he returned to
the detention center.

00:20:30.817 --> 00:20:31.860
Right?

00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:39.367
Hey.

00:20:39.492 --> 00:20:41.453
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:20:41.578 --> 00:20:43.121
What the? Why are you here alone?

00:20:43.246 --> 00:20:45.081
Prosecutor Seo won't make it.

00:20:45.207 --> 00:20:46.374
Why not?

00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:48.210
His disciplinary action's
been decided.

00:20:48.335 --> 00:20:49.377
What is it?

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.755
He won't know until he attends it.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.632
Was he notified to attend it?

00:20:57.594 --> 00:20:58.637
What?

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.351
It won't end with a reprimand.

00:21:05.894 --> 00:21:08.271
Still, he made a lot
of contribution this time.

00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:10.649
The disciplinary committee
doesn't know that.

00:21:11.608 --> 00:21:13.127
He also received
the model prosecutor award.

00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:14.361
He didn't. It got canceled.

00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:16.403
The serial murders.

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:18.281
That was so long ago.

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:21.701
- Purple.
- Purple is mine!

00:21:23.452 --> 00:21:24.704
You don't deserve to drink.

00:21:26.623 --> 00:21:28.792
It's true that he made
a lot of contributions.

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:32.587
Just because he saved a man this
year after killing one last year,

00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:34.589
it doesn't make what he did
last year go away.

00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:36.841
And we must not apply that rule

00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:39.052
in our job.

00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:44.849
Still, if they told him
to appear in person,

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:46.892
it might not be something
so uneasy.

00:21:48.186 --> 00:21:50.855
You think so?
Then perhaps a wage cut?

00:21:56.903 --> 00:22:00.031
Maybe they want to teach him
a lesson in person.

00:22:06.162 --> 00:22:07.872
(Ministry of Justice)

00:22:16.339 --> 00:22:19.758
I received various opinions
on you.

00:22:21.678 --> 00:22:25.140
I cannot give the names
of people who gave their opinions,

00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:28.600
but you played an integral role

00:22:28.727 --> 00:22:31.313
in arresting a violent criminal
recently.

00:22:32.689 --> 00:22:35.817
However, during the special
inspection in 2017...

00:22:35.942 --> 00:22:37.902
2017?

00:22:38.028 --> 00:22:40.238
No action was taken on you

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.492
because you were needed
to resolve the case.

00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:49.247
The government retrieved the
bribes you received at the time.

00:22:49.372 --> 00:22:52.917
Your role was needed
to resolve the case later.

00:22:54.919 --> 00:22:57.922
However, pretending
that a specific suspect hid

00:22:58.048 --> 00:23:00.550
the victim's article

00:23:00.674 --> 00:23:03.261
to frame the suspect as a culprit

00:23:03.386 --> 00:23:05.138
is all true.

00:23:12.812 --> 00:23:14.022
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:17.776
Yes.

00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:19.861
You didn't

00:23:19.986 --> 00:23:22.447
neglect your duty.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.243
However, you damaged prosecutors'
reputation and dignity.

00:23:28.035 --> 00:23:29.954
Dismissal. Removal?

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.623
A heavy disciplinary action...

00:23:31.748 --> 00:23:33.625
However, you were appointed
a model prosecutor

00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:35.752
by clearing a drug cartel

00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:38.129
and resolving a cold case.

00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:41.383
A wage cut.
A light disciplinary action...

00:23:41.508 --> 00:23:42.801
However,

00:23:42.926 --> 00:23:45.387
there is no valid reason

00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:46.888
to deny that you received

00:23:47.806 --> 00:23:48.848
bribery.

00:23:53.728 --> 00:23:55.688
Therefore, a majority
of the Ministry of Justice

00:23:55.814 --> 00:23:57.857
disciplinary committee agrees

00:23:58.316 --> 00:23:59.359
to dismiss

00:24:03.363 --> 00:24:04.739
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:24:08.368 --> 00:24:09.411
But...

00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:10.679
Come to the correctional
office number 503

00:24:10.703 --> 00:24:13.832
on 1st two months later by 9 a.m..

00:24:16.751 --> 00:24:17.794
But...

00:24:18.962 --> 00:24:20.004
Wait.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.095
But...

00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:43.570
(Seo Dong-jae,

I'm Moon Joseph.

00:25:42.128 --> 00:25:44.255
I've been newly assigned
to Cheongju District.

00:25:44.379 --> 00:25:45.422
Move. Make a room.

00:25:45.507 --> 00:25:48.593
Boss, have you heard

00:25:48.718 --> 00:25:52.222
whether I'll be transferred
to Seoul District?

00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:12.951
CEO Nam might lose his mind

00:26:13.076 --> 00:26:15.495
and confess everything.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.164
His crime of proxy murder has
pretty much been fixed.

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:19.707
I can't change that.

00:26:19.832 --> 00:26:22.293
That is not what I mean.

00:26:22.418 --> 00:26:25.505
I know a thing or two
about his slush fund.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.299
Say that you got it from
someone else, not me

00:26:28.424 --> 00:26:31.719
and disclosed it first.

00:26:31.844 --> 00:26:34.889
Before CEO Nam mentions
any innocent names.

(Cheongju Mayor)

00:26:36.349 --> 00:26:40.687
You won't be satisfied

00:26:40.812 --> 00:26:42.230
until you finish him off, right?

00:26:52.407 --> 00:26:53.700
(Ms. Jeon Mi-ran)

(Ehong Construction. zip)

00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:04.043
It contained a lot of information
about Ehong Construction.

00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:07.046
Probably.
That's why I sent it to you.

00:27:07.547 --> 00:27:09.173
May I ask where it's from?

00:27:10.341 --> 00:27:11.718
Someplace reliable.

00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:13.928
Aren't you busy?

00:27:14.554 --> 00:27:16.306
You said it contained
a lot of information.

00:27:16.347 --> 00:27:19.309
It's up to you to turn that
into evidence.

00:27:21.936 --> 00:27:23.396
I'll make good use of it.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.425
Hey, get a blanket.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.802
- Take pictures of everything.
- That's so much.

00:27:54.927 --> 00:27:57.639
Over 20 million dollars of cash
was found in CEO Nam Wan-seong

00:27:57.764 --> 00:28:00.433
of Ehong Construction's safe.

00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:03.061
The prosecution has issued
a warrant on CEO Nam

00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:05.855
for embezzlement.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.707
They will investigate
the source of the cash

00:28:07.732 --> 00:28:09.859
and his means of concealment.

00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:18.576
Geez, did she even chew?

00:28:19.452 --> 00:28:21.079
She's crazy busy.

00:28:21.204 --> 00:28:24.082
She has to investigate Ehong's
account fraud and embezzlement.

00:28:24.207 --> 00:28:26.018
Nam argues to appeal
for his proxy murder charge.

00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:27.251
The apartment residents

00:28:27.377 --> 00:28:30.213
are planning to sue him
for damages.

00:28:30.338 --> 00:28:32.256
That room's bombarded with work

00:28:32.382 --> 00:28:33.966
for going after Nam Wan-seong.

00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:36.636
It's Nam Wan-seong who's busy.

00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:39.347
Wouldn't it be faster
to fix him in the defendant's seat

00:28:39.472 --> 00:28:41.182
and have the trials take turns?

00:28:46.312 --> 00:28:47.438
Hello?

00:28:47.563 --> 00:28:48.606
What?

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:53.528
Oh, thank you.

00:28:53.653 --> 00:28:55.905
I'm looking forward
to meeting you soon.

00:29:00.284 --> 00:29:01.536
Who was that?

00:29:02.161 --> 00:29:05.164
Hey, I guess I'll be transferred
to the supreme office.

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:06.332
What?

00:29:06.374 --> 00:29:07.667
Is that what it was about?

00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:09.210
Congratulations.

00:29:10.169 --> 00:29:13.172
Well, the job is the same
everywhere I go.

00:29:20.805 --> 00:29:23.975
Even if he's going to the supreme
office, he still has to clean up.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.853
It's unbelievable
that he can walk on his own.

00:29:26.978 --> 00:29:28.187
My goodness.

Yes.

00:30:25.453 --> 00:30:29.207
Did the committee also
tell you to appear today?

00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:30.374
Yes.

00:30:32.668 --> 00:30:34.420
But why the correctional office?

00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:37.006
I'm not sure.

I don't know
what we're doing here.

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:00.232
I'll call you when I visit Seoul.

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:01.716
Yes, promise.

Thank you for everything, Mr. Jo.

00:32:03.092 --> 00:32:05.511
Thank you. This is sad.

00:32:08.014 --> 00:32:09.348
Okay.

00:32:09.724 --> 00:32:10.766
Take care.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.435
Take care, Prosecutor Sung.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.812
If you rely on your youth,
you'll be knocked down soon.

00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:18.774
Get inside. It's not like
I'm going anywhere fancy.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.403
She really left.

00:32:22.904 --> 00:32:24.155
- Get inside. Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.699
- Prosecutor.
- Why do you keep calling me?

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:29.261
You should've been nice when you
had a chance. Give me a hug.

00:32:29.285 --> 00:32:30.620
Are you back?

00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:31.996

No.

Then?

00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:42.548
- I'll see you when I'm done.
- Done what?

I was nothing? Huh?

What am I then?

Geez, I hate that guy.

00:33:12.954 --> 00:33:14.264
In Daejeon District,
you covered up

your son's bullying

00:33:16.415 --> 00:33:19.543

How dare you...

Appearing with a business card
I've never seen before.

00:33:25.841 --> 00:33:27.510
Prosecution inspection, my ass.

00:33:27.635 --> 00:33:28.928
You inspect me?

00:33:29.053 --> 00:33:31.847
So much for the pot calling
the kettle black.

00:33:31.973 --> 00:33:33.391
The investigation is already over.

00:33:34.225 --> 00:33:36.644
Even your brother's case
in Cheongju District.

00:33:39.438 --> 00:33:43.484
Notifying the inspection subject
of the inspection.

00:33:43.609 --> 00:33:44.860
That is part of the procedure,

00:33:45.653 --> 00:33:47.154
and that is what I'm doing
right now.

00:33:48.572 --> 00:33:50.282
What's the next procedure?

00:33:50.408 --> 00:33:51.742
Punish me?

00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:53.869
We don't punish anyone.

00:33:53.995 --> 00:33:55.788
We only report.

00:33:55.913 --> 00:33:57.081
To whom?

00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:59.750

You.

It was you who called me here.

00:34:11.637 --> 00:34:13.806
Because I'm a pot,

00:34:13.931 --> 00:34:15.725
I know which kettle to call black.

00:34:23.774 --> 00:34:25.568
Have you identified
each other yet?

00:34:26.819 --> 00:34:28.571
Do you recognize each other?

00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:32.158
Dismissal, removal, suspension.

00:34:32.283 --> 00:34:34.326
A wage cut is never enough
to join you.

00:34:36.912 --> 00:34:37.997
Nice watch there.

00:34:40.082 --> 00:34:41.667
Corrupted prosecutors.

00:34:42.626 --> 00:34:44.628
Unlawful colleagues.

00:34:45.671 --> 00:34:48.549
Yet your superiors thrive.

00:34:49.175 --> 00:34:51.343
You know when, where, and how
they move

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.471
the best.

00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:56.265
Despite the region and rank,

00:34:56.891 --> 00:34:58.684
you'll move before they move.

00:34:59.727 --> 00:35:00.853
Do you mean we are

00:35:00.978 --> 00:35:03.689
the TF Team investigating
prosecutors' corruption?

00:35:03.814 --> 00:35:05.024
You got it.

00:35:05.524 --> 00:35:07.068
A thief knows a thief.

00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:10.237
Those who received bribery catch
those who will receive bribery.

00:35:11.113 --> 00:35:14.200
But the supreme office already has
the anti-corruption team.

00:35:14.325 --> 00:35:17.078
If you think this team isn't
necessary, you may leave now.

00:35:18.162 --> 00:35:20.706
In a couple of years,

00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:22.541
you can all work as lawyers.

00:35:23.918 --> 00:35:26.837
Do we have no job because
of the anti-corruption team?

00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:30.174
Is there no corruption?

00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:33.177
You all have someone in your mind,
don't you?

00:35:34.512 --> 00:35:35.554
However,

00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:38.766
since you've all been dismissed
from your positions,

00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:40.601
you are not

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.270
official government officials.

00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:44.271
That means,

00:35:44.396 --> 00:35:47.525
no bonus or overtime pay.
Only the basic salary.

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:50.568
I'll still get you business cards

00:35:50.694 --> 00:35:52.696
since it's necessary
for the mind game.

00:35:56.033 --> 00:35:57.867
I'm not ashamed after a while.

00:35:59.203 --> 00:36:00.788
Because it's a proud job.

00:36:01.455 --> 00:36:02.915
A job that should be done.

00:36:11.965 --> 00:36:14.151
(Ministry of Justice
Prosecution Investigation TF Team)

00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:15.427
(Seo Dong-jae)

00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:37.116
My goodness.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:43.330
What a nice world we live in.

00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:45.331
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:48.544
Ms. Kim,

00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:51.045
is it common to get suspended?

00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:53.340
Even Ms. Jeon got suspended.

00:36:53.465 --> 00:36:55.926
Too much for the first year, huh?

00:36:57.887 --> 00:36:59.096
Is it about the day

00:36:59.638 --> 00:37:01.557
Prosecutor Seo visited her?

00:37:04.185 --> 00:37:05.561
Did you know?

00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:07.730
What happened between
Prosecutor Seo and Ms. Jeon?

00:37:08.022 --> 00:37:09.857
Ask Prosecutor Seo yourself.

00:37:12.234 --> 00:37:14.445
I don't feel comfortable
about calling him.

00:37:15.613 --> 00:37:16.697
You shouldn't.

00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:21.327
You have to hint him that Mr. Jo
will be going after him soon.

00:37:24.538 --> 00:37:27.166
You mean Mr. Jo Byung-gun?
Why would he?

00:37:28.082 --> 00:37:29.417
He's waiting to get back at him.

00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:31.128
A prosecution inspection team?

00:37:32.129 --> 00:37:33.422
Prosecutor Seo?

00:37:34.048 --> 00:37:35.090
Jo Byung-gun.

00:37:36.342 --> 00:37:37.509
You really were nothing.

00:37:39.678 --> 00:37:42.973
Did he mean
that he dug dirt on me?

00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:45.851
I'll kill that Seo Dong-jae prick.

00:38:00.866 --> 00:38:02.992
Let's start with the trial result
from last week.

00:38:03.118 --> 00:38:04.370
You mean Nam Gyeo-rye?

00:38:04.495 --> 00:38:07.539
He's on probation.
He decided not to appeal.

00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:12.419
It was his first offense,
and he admitted to his charges.

00:38:13.128 --> 00:38:14.462
Good job.

00:38:14.588 --> 00:38:15.673
Thank you.

00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:32.188
(Late Im Yu-ri)

00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:34.774
I didn't know you liked this.

00:39:29.163 --> 00:39:30.205
CEO Nam.

00:39:38.964 --> 00:39:40.049
I heard you went bankrupt.

00:39:46.138 --> 00:39:47.181
Shoot.

00:39:53.019 --> 00:39:55.356
I'm seeing good performance.

00:39:55.481 --> 00:39:56.750
You had an eye for whom to hire.

00:39:56.774 --> 00:39:59.651
Thanks to your list of candidates.

00:40:01.153 --> 00:40:03.739
A disciplinary committee isn't so
bad if you consider that.

00:40:03.864 --> 00:40:05.407
My goodness.

00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:07.826
Can you call them talents?

00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:12.748
So? Now that you created
an unprecedented team with them,

00:40:12.873 --> 00:40:14.625
do you feel relieved?

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:17.086
It's no team.

00:40:17.878 --> 00:40:19.421
There are only six.

00:40:20.422 --> 00:40:22.925
That sounds like you want to
make it bigger.

00:40:23.634 --> 00:40:26.178
Well, why not?

00:40:29.848 --> 00:40:32.099
I had no idea about your ambition

00:40:32.226 --> 00:40:33.560
when I approved it.

00:40:34.727 --> 00:40:36.897
You'll be backstabbing high-ups.

00:40:37.022 --> 00:40:39.149
Don't be like this, chief.

00:40:39.274 --> 00:40:42.111
You were the oldest to approve it.

00:40:43.695 --> 00:40:44.738
Shut up.

00:40:46.448 --> 00:40:48.575
People think I'm in my early 40s.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.121
When I talk informally to you,
people think I'm rude.

00:40:53.956 --> 00:40:55.581
If you say so,

00:40:55.707 --> 00:40:57.334
I'll drop the honorifics.

00:40:58.752 --> 00:41:00.003
Is that okay?

00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:03.799
I shouldn't have brought you back.

00:41:04.966 --> 00:41:06.008
Sir.

00:41:06.844 --> 00:41:09.596
In your 50s
but still looking like early 40s.

00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:11.348
- Stop it.
- See you for lunch.

00:41:14.184 --> 00:41:15.644
He argued he never received

00:41:15.769 --> 00:41:18.063
any free golf round or wine,

00:41:18.188 --> 00:41:19.857
but the rumor says he received

00:41:19.982 --> 00:41:22.234
support that wasn't evident.

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:23.944
Support that wasn't evident?
Like what?

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.530
Like his children's
learning center costs.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:29.616
It's a lot when it saves up.

00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:30.784
Okay.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.453
Yes?

00:41:33.245 --> 00:41:35.247
About the chief prosecutor
I mentioned before.

00:41:35.372 --> 00:41:37.374
Insult, verbal abuse, and cursing.

00:41:37.499 --> 00:41:39.585
There was so much. So I

00:41:40.586 --> 00:41:42.461
- just sent it to you.
- Okay.

00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:44.423
Nice.

00:41:44.547 --> 00:41:46.091
Keep up with your work.

00:41:46.216 --> 00:41:47.050
Yes.

00:41:47.174 --> 00:41:48.843
- I'll see you later.
- Get back to work.

00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:56.643
How is it?

00:41:58.228 --> 00:41:59.313
What do you mean?

00:41:59.438 --> 00:42:00.481
You know.

00:42:02.399 --> 00:42:03.650
Not bad.

00:42:04.735 --> 00:42:05.777
In what way?

00:42:06.278 --> 00:42:07.654
Better than doing nothing.

00:42:08.906 --> 00:42:10.282
I'm guessing you don't like it?

00:42:11.157 --> 00:42:14.495
It's not that I don't like it.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.831
It's more like I'm still useful.

00:42:20.083 --> 00:42:21.126
Got it.

00:42:22.044 --> 00:42:23.504
Keep up the good work.
The law firm.

00:42:23.962 --> 00:42:25.005
The law firm.

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:27.466
Why did I quit?

00:42:29.843 --> 00:42:31.053
Not sure.

00:42:32.679 --> 00:42:35.516
'I'm stopping justice
from catching the bad guys'

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.645
'I would've caught in the past.'

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.524
'That's what law firms are doing.'

00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:46.067
That's why.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.362
Because I was a prosecutor
after all.

00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:51.573
I worked as one for over 20 years.

00:42:51.698 --> 00:42:52.908
You'd never agree, would you?

00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:56.411
I think I liked
being a prosecutor.

00:42:57.496 --> 00:42:58.539
Sure.

00:43:00.249 --> 00:43:01.333
It makes no sense, huh?

00:43:02.501 --> 00:43:04.044
How come?

00:43:05.212 --> 00:43:06.921
Because I screwed it up.

00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:13.679
Perhaps you can make it
work again.

00:43:20.227 --> 00:43:21.895
Then it really makes no sense.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.063
I'll see you later.

00:43:34.073 --> 00:43:35.450
Is it my imagination?

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:39.162
It feels like he's talking less.

00:43:40.872 --> 00:43:43.584
Whatever. It's Seo Dong-jae.

00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:12.904
I'll bust all your asses,
you sons of guns.

00:44:19.244 --> 00:44:21.830
Dongjae, The Good or the Bad.

00:44:21.955 --> 00:44:22.998
The end.
