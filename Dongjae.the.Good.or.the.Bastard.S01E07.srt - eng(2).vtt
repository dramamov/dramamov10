Oh, I'm ashamed.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:05.952
Just like all other
fellow prosecutors

who are working day and night
throughout the country,

00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:12.624
I only stayed true to my duty.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.045
How did you arrest the drug dealer
this time?

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.006
Live by the drugs,
die by the drugs.

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.554
Even the one who makes
strong drugs

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.389
cannot avoid the smell.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.310
And I remembered
who smelled like one.

00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:33.980
The bowling center he ran
was under a stolen name.

00:06:34.105 --> 00:06:35.690
So were his phone
and his bank account.

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:38.151
When I thought I had no chance
to find him,

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:40.111
I found crucial evidence.

00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:43.447
The medical record.

00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:46.242
You can get a phone or open
a bank account with a stolen name,

00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:48.494
but you can't do that
with a medical treatment.

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:49.954
He has to go there in person.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:52.640
I went all the way to the Ministry
of Food and Drug Safety.

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:54.208
I looked up all the records

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:57.170
of opioids prescription

00:06:57.295 --> 00:06:58.796
near Cheongju.

00:06:59.547 --> 00:07:02.592
Can you briefly tell us
about the case?

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:05.761
Why did you kill him?

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.433
Hong Tae-ik wanted to pull out,

00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:12.185
but Kang Soo-min didn't want that.

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:15.229
Hello?

00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:19.066
I told you today was
the last batch.

00:07:19.192 --> 00:07:21.235
Let me live in peace.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.237
Now that this happened,
it's either do or die.

00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:25.114
Unless you want to die,
keep making it.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:27.950
Then the drugs were found
in a wrong place.

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:29.702
Im Yu-ri.

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:32.955
Kang Soo-min thought
someone who wanted to quit

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.582
joined hands with someone else.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.918
The feeling of betrayal

00:07:37.793 --> 00:07:38.878
made him angry.

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:41.547
After Im Yu-ri was murdered,

00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:43.466
he attempted to kill
Hong Tae-ik too.

00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:45.885
But he was murdered
by Hong Tae-ik instead.

00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:51.390
Why did he shoot the man
who was already dead

00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:53.017
due to drugs?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.812
Were you taking revenge
for Yu-ri? You of all people?

00:07:56.938 --> 00:07:58.898
You son of a gun.

00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:01.192
How dare you...

00:08:05.947 --> 00:08:06.989
Sign it.

00:08:07.114 --> 00:08:10.368
When everyone went to
Pyeongtaek Harbor

00:08:10.493 --> 00:08:12.662
after the victim's car was found,

00:08:12.787 --> 00:08:14.472
you were the only one
who chose to go to the hospital?

00:08:14.497 --> 00:08:16.165
The drug makers suffer

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.792
from COPD

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:21.796
which means chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.

00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.340
I read that they rely
on immediate-release morphine

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:26.008
from the interview done by

00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:28.886
head of the drug team
Kim Ki-sool in the supreme office.

00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:31.781
I found the hospital from the
Ministry of Food and Drug Safety,

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.724
and I was able to arrest him.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.978
I look forward to meeting him
to thanking him in person soon.

00:08:37.103 --> 00:08:38.896
Thank you so much,
Mr. Kim Ki-sool.

00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:42.275
How was it?

00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:43.734
Do you want to see it?

00:08:46.612 --> 00:08:49.740
Just like all other
fellow prosecutors...

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:51.701
It's kind of cringey.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:53.160
Then...

00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:54.912
No, don't turn it off.

00:08:57.164 --> 00:09:00.001
How did you arrest the drug dealer
this time?

00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:03.254
What did he say?

00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:07.091
What else?

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:09.969
If I told Nam Gyeo-rye
that he'd be adored

00:09:10.094 --> 00:09:11.637
in prison.

00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:14.932
Did you tell the human rights
commission that you did?

00:09:15.057 --> 00:09:17.018
I said I did because I did.

00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:18.269
So what?

00:09:22.523 --> 00:09:23.566
What about the cap?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.363
Yu-ri is torn into pieces online.

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:33.200
Congratulations.

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.910
Oh, no.

00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:36.078
Sit down.

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:37.663
Congratulations.

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:39.707
Oh, sir.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.586
- Congratulations.
- It's all thanks to you.

00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:45.671
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

00:09:45.963 --> 00:09:48.174
My arms are starting to feel numb.

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:51.218
Boss, here.

00:09:53.596 --> 00:09:54.805
Can you pour me a glass too?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.891
Well done.

00:09:57.016 --> 00:09:58.059
Oh, not at all.

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.854
- Well done, Prosecutor Jo.
- Thank you.

00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:04.065
I know how much you went through.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.776
I heard you wasted your time
traveling to Seoul and Pyeongtaek.

00:10:09.236 --> 00:10:11.088
And you even went on
the guard ship in that weather?

00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:13.366
I should've gone to the harbor.
I'm sorry.

00:10:13.907 --> 00:10:15.867
Prosecutor Sung helped me
big time.

00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:17.703
What are you doing? Tell her.

00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:20.915
You said it was strange
that the victim washed

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.291
the shoes and clothes together

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.627
and requested an analysis.

00:10:24.752 --> 00:10:25.544
Yes.

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:27.296
And people in my office.

00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:30.758
Because I often worked outside
the office, they had a hard time.

00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:32.550
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you.

00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:33.844
Thank you.

00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:36.348
You're barely eating. Want me
to order you something else?

00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:48.066
- Chief Prosecutor.
- Hi.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:51.278
You should've gone to someplace
nice. Why always here?

00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:53.364
Good job.

00:10:53.489 --> 00:10:54.532
Thank you.

00:10:54.657 --> 00:10:56.075
- Sit down.
- Yes.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.618
Sit down. I don't want to
make you feel uncomfortable.

00:10:58.743 --> 00:11:00.204
- This way.
- Should I?

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:01.621
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:03.999
Oh.

00:11:06.794 --> 00:11:07.837
Thanks.

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:09.422
It's an honor.

00:11:09.547 --> 00:11:11.256
Chill out. It's okay.

00:11:11.382 --> 00:11:12.425
Thank you.

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:15.261
Right. Is your model prosecutor
award ceremony tomorrow?

00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:16.137
Yes, sir.

00:11:16.262 --> 00:11:18.055
- Who's taking you?
- Me.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.223
Really?

00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:21.475
It was me who recommended you.

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:25.521
Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:11:25.646 --> 00:11:26.981
I'll make you proud tomorrow.

00:11:27.106 --> 00:11:28.691
I'm sure you will.

00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:30.484
- How about a toast?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:31.652
Here.

00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:34.697
Congratulations to Team 1.

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:35.573
Thank you.

00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:37.491
I can't believe this happened
to our office.

00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.494
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.205
Can you replace all the grills

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:45.958
and get us 20 servings
of Korean beef tenderloin?

00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:52.214
Have something nice.

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:54.133
Sir, this place costs
over 1,000 dollars.

00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:58.220
What's nice about having a chief?
Right?

00:11:58.345 --> 00:11:59.472
Thank you.

00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:00.639
Wow.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.359
So this is how it feels.

00:12:13.444 --> 00:12:15.696
To be in the center
of celebration.

00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:18.073
Be in the highlight.

00:12:25.247 --> 00:12:26.790
What an eyesore.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.585
You don't know? No?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.294
Okay. Good job.

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:33.464
You know, right?

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:34.924
Chief Prosecutor.

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:37.760
I spent months on this case
to seize the chance...

00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:38.636
- Oh, hot.
- Hey.

00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:41.113
It was my case, you know?

00:12:41.138 --> 00:12:42.781
It was my case, you know?
- Mr. Jo.
- Are you listening?

00:12:42.806 --> 00:12:44.433
Let's get up.

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:49.145
It was me who raided the scene.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.397
That's enough.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.903
- If it weren't for seizure...
- Stop it.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.572
My apologies. Why don't we get up?

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:01.492
Yes? Let's go then.

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:08.457
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:14.213
Goodnight.

00:13:18.008 --> 00:13:19.051
Let's go.

00:13:19.718 --> 00:13:20.886
Goodnight.

00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:22.529
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Thank you for coming.

00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:23.806
Goodnight.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.644
Where's your car key?

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:30.437
Come on.

00:13:32.106 --> 00:13:33.399
Gosh, you're so heavy.

00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:35.651
- Bye.
- Watch your head.

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:37.528
Bye.

00:13:37.987 --> 00:13:40.072
- Cover him.
- Make sure to cover him.

00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:41.949
Bye, Mr. Jo.

00:13:42.074 --> 00:13:44.034
Geez, I didn't even get to
say bye to the chief.

00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:49.748
Gosh, it's freezing.

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:44.428
By Jung-gi, for Jung-gi.
Jung-gi TV.

00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:48.223
I received a lot of stories
again today.

00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:50.809
We'll take a look at that later.

00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:52.853
Can you introduce yourself first?

00:14:56.148 --> 00:14:57.399
It's Nam Wan-seong.

00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:02.029
Are you the father of Nam
who became the suspect

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:04.239
of a recent gunshot death?

00:15:04.365 --> 00:15:05.658
Yes.

00:15:06.116 --> 00:15:08.619
How's your son doing?

00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.456
He can't even go to school.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.336
Not to blame his teachers
and friends.

00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:20.923
When the prosecutor used
violence against him.

00:15:21.048 --> 00:15:21.965
What?

00:15:22.091 --> 00:15:24.218
The prosecutor hit him? Why?

00:15:24.968 --> 00:15:26.387
To make him the culprit.

00:15:27.638 --> 00:15:29.848
People don't do that anymore.

00:15:30.974 --> 00:15:34.311
Seriously, you're getting
on my nerves.

00:15:34.687 --> 00:15:35.896
What?
I'm going to prolong it.

00:15:36.313 --> 00:15:38.607
I'm going to prolong it.

00:15:38.732 --> 00:15:40.150
I'm going to prolong it. Why?

00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:42.861
Because you're graduating soon.

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:44.988
I'll wait
until you become an adult...

00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:47.491
I'll wait
until you become an adult

00:15:47.616 --> 00:15:49.410
and give you life.

00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.496
I didn't say that.

00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:54.998
Those are the exact words
the prosecutor in charge said.

00:15:55.124 --> 00:15:57.501
Verbal violence by the prosecutor

00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:58.919
in the name of interrogation.

00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:00.879
Oh.

00:16:01.004 --> 00:16:03.632
You need to be careful.

00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:04.800
Well...

00:16:05.134 --> 00:16:07.219
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae is

00:16:07.344 --> 00:16:08.595
apparently an expert

00:16:09.221 --> 00:16:10.806
in this.

00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:13.976
Was the name
of the prosecutor in charge

00:16:14.518 --> 00:16:16.145
Seo Dong-jae?

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.188
Yes, it turns out

00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:19.940
my son wasn't the first victim

00:16:20.065 --> 00:16:21.942
he framed

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:23.902
an innocent person.

00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:25.362
It's habitual.

00:16:25.487 --> 00:16:27.698
I cannot believe
that a man like him

00:16:27.823 --> 00:16:29.700
is still working as a prosecutor.

00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:31.034
Please calm down.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.162
You brought something?

00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:34.955
- Yes.
- Let's listen to it.

00:16:36.623 --> 00:16:39.710
The police beat me
accusing me of killing my father.

00:16:39.835 --> 00:16:41.044
And the prosecutor too.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.548
So I had a crush
on a girl from school.

00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:46.759
And my dad got our way,

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:48.927
so I stabbed him.

00:16:49.052 --> 00:16:51.555
They said I was a murderer.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.557
I had an evident alibi,

00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:55.392
but the prosecutor ignored it.

00:16:56.435 --> 00:16:58.687
I'm not making this up.
I later found out

00:16:58.812 --> 00:17:01.815
that he tried to plant

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.692
fake evidence in my room.

00:17:03.817 --> 00:17:06.278
Yes, it was
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:17:07.362 --> 00:17:08.655
Wait. What?

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:12.034
This isn't the 80s.

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:14.828
It took place in 2017.

00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:16.622
So

00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:20.876
A prosecutor with over
20 years of experience

00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:23.629
gaslighted young kids
that they were murderers.

00:17:23.754 --> 00:17:25.063
Just like how he did again
to my son!

00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:26.298
I see.

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:30.844
One could say that the prosecutor

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:33.180
is somewhat coercive,

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:37.351
but nothing explains
fake evidence.

00:17:37.476 --> 00:17:40.729
He didn't even get fired?

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.397
What I'm worried about the most is

00:17:42.523 --> 00:17:45.609
that more innocent victims
are expected

00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:48.654
to be framed for doing nothing

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:50.447
like my son or this voice.

00:17:50.823 --> 00:17:52.866
If he's done that twice before,

00:17:52.991 --> 00:17:54.259
what would stop him
from doing it for the third time?

00:17:54.284 --> 00:17:55.327
(Wife)

00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:57.663
Honey, which suit should I wear...

00:17:57.788 --> 00:18:00.916
But why would the prosecutor
do that?

00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:02.584
To manipulate the case

00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:04.502
by planting fake evidence?

00:18:04.628 --> 00:18:08.298
In 2017,

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.843
Prosecutor Seo received a bribe

00:18:12.094 --> 00:18:14.096
from a dead man.

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.264
What?

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:18.557
He tried to cover it up

00:18:18.684 --> 00:18:21.435
before something that leads to him
would appear.

00:18:21.562 --> 00:18:22.980
What's shocking is that

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.207
- this is exactly the same.
- Prosecutor Seo.

00:18:25.232 --> 00:18:26.959
- this is exactly the same.
- Prosecutor Seo.
Congratulations.

00:18:26.984 --> 00:18:28.652
By 'this, '

00:18:28.777 --> 00:18:29.987
it sounds like

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:34.241
your son's case is

00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:35.576
about bribery as well?

00:18:37.202 --> 00:18:41.164
I need time to think
before I can talk about this.

00:18:42.916 --> 00:18:43.959

00:20:41.201 --> 00:20:42.244
Is she not here yet?

00:20:42.911 --> 00:20:43.787
Isn't that him?

00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:46.331
- That's Seo Dong-jae, right?
- No way. It's him.

00:20:46.456 --> 00:20:48.792
How brazen. I wouldn't have come
if I were him.

00:20:49.292 --> 00:20:52.628
That's crazy.
How can a prosecutor...

00:20:52.754 --> 00:20:54.506
He's insane.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.052
(Investigator)

00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:01.096
Excuse me.

00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:03.724
- Are you Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae?
- Yes.

00:21:03.848 --> 00:21:05.617
I'm from the PR team.
We talked on the phone.

00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:06.852
Oh, yes.

00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:07.870
I didn't expect to meet you here.

00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:09.121
I didn't expect to meet you here.
Yes.

00:21:09.146 --> 00:21:11.314
Thank you
for the interview questions.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.316
Right. But...

00:21:13.442 --> 00:21:14.484
Yes?

00:21:19.488 --> 00:21:20.699
Sit down, sit down.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.832
- I'm sorry, but will you leave?
- What?

00:21:28.957 --> 00:21:30.834
The decision was just made.
You need to leave.

00:21:30.917 --> 00:21:33.086
- Decision for what?
- Come with me.

00:21:33.211 --> 00:21:35.213
- Wait.
- Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

00:21:35.338 --> 00:21:37.524
The model employee awards
for the second half of 2023...

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.260
Didn't we talk on the phone?

00:21:40.843 --> 00:21:43.013
- Wait.
- No pictures.

00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:48.560
- Honey.
- You need to leave.

00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:49.895
Get out.

00:21:52.147 --> 00:21:55.150
First, we will award
the model prosecutor.

00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:59.321
The Chief Prosecutor from the
supreme office will present it.

00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.323
Please give a big round
of applause.

00:22:07.287 --> 00:22:10.123
Even though he arrested
a major drug cartel,

00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:12.876
we cannot compliment him big time.

00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:15.087
Despite what he's done,

00:22:15.212 --> 00:22:16.755
he should be glad
if he's not stoned.

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:19.049
I feel bad.

00:22:20.092 --> 00:22:20.842
I'm sorry.

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:22.344
Don't be.

00:22:22.469 --> 00:22:24.637
Because you recommended
someone like him,

00:22:24.763 --> 00:22:27.182
the supreme office was humiliated.

00:22:27.307 --> 00:22:29.142
That's not your fault.

00:22:29.267 --> 00:22:30.852
I think

00:22:30.977 --> 00:22:33.855
we can compensate Prosecutor Seo

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.357
internally.

00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:38.693
- It was me who recommended you.
- Oh, yes.

00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:40.654
It's not like that happened
in Cheongju.

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:42.030
It happened a long ago.

00:22:42.155 --> 00:22:45.075
No boss would have known, right?

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:50.247
However, if any trouble is
expected to happen,

00:22:50.372 --> 00:22:52.374
but it's not stopped in advance?

00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:54.625
That's a matter of leadership.

00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.837
The same goes for other teams.

00:22:57.379 --> 00:22:59.631
You must not stop verifying.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:07.097
Why aren't you eating?

00:23:07.222 --> 00:23:08.682
Eat up.

00:23:09.391 --> 00:23:10.934
Eat.

00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:15.856
Why do we have to be
on eggshells too?

00:23:15.981 --> 00:23:17.499
I told you
we should've eaten outside.

00:23:17.524 --> 00:23:19.943
How can we go without our boss?

00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:24.281
Is it refreshing?

00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:27.576
The soup.

00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:31.621
I knew he was always arrogant.

00:23:32.205 --> 00:23:35.584
Prosecutor Seo wasn't arrogant.

00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:37.002
He made a big mistake.

00:23:38.128 --> 00:23:40.254
How dare he try to climb up?

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.299
You can't say that.

00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:44.885
Considering his age
and years of experience.

00:23:48.555 --> 00:23:50.849
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

00:23:56.354 --> 00:23:57.438
Will you slow down?

00:24:07.532 --> 00:24:08.575
I'm sorry.

00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:13.078
Sorry, I...

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.290
Today, I should

00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:18.460
just go.

00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:20.377
Is it true?

00:24:21.213 --> 00:24:22.505
Did you really do that?

00:24:23.131 --> 00:24:25.008
Everything they claimed,
is it true?

00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:31.640
I don't know. I didn't watch it.

00:24:34.351 --> 00:24:35.393
Seriously.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.688
A model prosecutor?

00:24:40.565 --> 00:24:42.234
A model prosecutor, my ass.

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:44.444
What are you going to do now?
You idiot.

00:24:44.569 --> 00:24:46.195
What a dimwit.

00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:51.743
If I die in anger,
I'm going to sue you.

00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:57.999
You better ask him
for his forgiveness.

00:24:58.124 --> 00:25:00.168
Go on your knees
and beg him, got it?

00:25:00.627 --> 00:25:02.837
Don't you dare mention
forgiveness.

00:25:02.963 --> 00:25:04.005
Who...

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:19.229
It's the file on Soogok-dong.
About Mr. Kang.

00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:23.982
Get the file on the professor
from Prosecutor Seo

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:25.860
- and wrap it up.
- Okay.

00:25:26.569 --> 00:25:29.572
The national drug cartel
investigation organization meeting

00:25:29.698 --> 00:25:31.116
is taking place
on 15th next month.

00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:33.201
You can present it.

00:25:33.326 --> 00:25:35.245
Say you arrested the drug maker.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.498
Get every detail
so you can ask every question.

00:25:38.623 --> 00:25:40.625
And how he specified the hospital

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.836
where the drug maker received
opioids prescription.

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:44.212
Yes.

00:25:45.714 --> 00:25:47.007
No news from your snitch yet?

00:25:47.132 --> 00:25:48.507
I think he's hiding somewhere

00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:51.261
in case he gets attacked
in revenge.

00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.796
He'll appear soon.

00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:55.507
He's not afraid of anything now
that his brother-in-law's dead.

00:26:04.808 --> 00:26:06.226
(Ehong Construction)

00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:07.394
Who's here?

00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:15.360
Thank you for coming.

00:26:16.361 --> 00:26:18.863
What brings you all the way here?

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:22.492
Because of what you've done,

00:26:22.617 --> 00:26:24.577
if people see us together outside,

00:26:24.703 --> 00:26:27.330
they might think a prosecutor is
trying to make a deal.

00:26:29.457 --> 00:26:31.084
You are here to make a deal.

00:26:37.132 --> 00:26:39.884
No? Then do you want some coffee?

00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:43.096
We can't undo
what's already been done.

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:45.432
Let's stop here.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.771
You got two things wrong.

00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:56.401
One. That's not something
for you to say.

00:26:57.777 --> 00:27:00.447
Two. You cannot demand it from me

00:27:00.572 --> 00:27:03.366
as if you're the boss of me.

00:27:06.745 --> 00:27:10.332
You know better than that.

00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:13.752
Let's go down together, shall we?

00:27:18.214 --> 00:27:19.466
What do you want?

00:27:25.013 --> 00:27:26.097
Don't forget.

00:27:26.598 --> 00:27:28.600
It's about my brother,

00:27:28.725 --> 00:27:30.101
but for you, it's about your son.

00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:32.103
Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:27:32.771 --> 00:27:35.065
He's already selling drugs
that age.

00:27:35.607 --> 00:27:37.734
When his father goes down,

00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:40.028
can't you see the kind of life
he's expected to live?

00:27:40.445 --> 00:27:41.863
If you mess with my son,

00:27:43.615 --> 00:27:44.824
we're all going down.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.119
While I'm asking you
what you want nicely,

00:27:49.204 --> 00:27:50.914
get what you want.

00:27:54.876 --> 00:27:58.046
Oh, why are you worried
about that?

00:27:59.255 --> 00:28:00.298
Huh?

00:28:01.674 --> 00:28:04.052
I thought you came
all the way here yourself

00:28:04.177 --> 00:28:06.096
for your subordinates.

00:28:07.222 --> 00:28:09.432
But you're here for yourself?

00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:11.976
'Seeing what Nam Wan-seong did'

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.896
'to Seo Dong-jae,
I can't sit on my hands.'

00:28:15.021 --> 00:28:16.815
'I'll end up like him too
one day.'

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.442
'I'll take the lead before that.
I'll double down.'

00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:22.404
Is that what you had on your mind?

00:28:25.448 --> 00:28:26.741
What happened to me?

00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:29.661
Come on. I'm not an idiot.

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:33.289
I'm saying I wouldn't tackle you.

00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:34.958
And I have nothing on you.

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:37.836
Between you and me, it's

00:28:37.961 --> 00:28:40.088
always... You know?

00:28:40.755 --> 00:28:41.798
Always.

00:28:43.007 --> 00:28:44.050
You know?

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:45.885
All clear.

00:28:46.511 --> 00:28:48.054
Yes? All clear.

00:28:49.514 --> 00:28:50.557
Yes?

00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:57.897
Excuse me.

00:29:04.446 --> 00:29:07.449
Should I just jump off
with that Nam jerk?

00:29:15.415 --> 00:29:18.668
Why did he have to appear now
after all these years?

00:29:22.172 --> 00:29:23.965
What they say is right.

00:29:24.507 --> 00:29:26.801
It is better to suffer
an injustice than to inflict one.

00:29:28.052 --> 00:29:29.262
Park Kyung-wan.

00:29:29.637 --> 00:29:31.181
This is wrong.

00:29:31.306 --> 00:29:33.475
This isn't the 19th century.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.060
You can't threaten me
and put me in prison by force.

00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:38.521
I even forgot about his name.

00:29:54.245 --> 00:29:55.497
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:29:56.414 --> 00:29:57.582
Prosecutor Seo?

00:29:59.876 --> 00:30:00.752
(Disciplinary Committee)

00:30:00.877 --> 00:30:02.837
Aware of the disciplinary
suspect's right?

00:30:02.962 --> 00:30:04.005
Yes.

00:30:04.797 --> 00:30:06.674
You may appoint a special attorney

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:09.177
and submit a supplementary
testimony or evidence.

00:30:10.261 --> 00:30:11.513
Are you going to get a lawyer?

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:13.473
No.

00:30:14.974 --> 00:30:16.809
In 2017,

00:30:17.977 --> 00:30:20.813
after quitting your job,
you moved to the Blue House.

00:30:21.648 --> 00:30:22.690
What?

00:30:23.942 --> 00:30:26.569
You knew prosecutors were banned
from working in the Blue House.

00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:29.155
- Why...
- After leaving the Blue House,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.742
you returned to the prosecution
service as if you were new.

00:30:33.826 --> 00:30:34.869
That's an expedient.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.498
I thought I was here

00:30:38.998 --> 00:30:42.168
to give my explanation
on the recent disclosure.

00:30:48.675 --> 00:30:50.218
Sure. Explain.

00:30:50.677 --> 00:30:51.719
Okay.

00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:58.685
Nam Wan-seong's claim

00:30:59.302 --> 00:31:02.138
resulted from his ill intention

00:31:02.972 --> 00:31:06.309
to remove his son's drug charges.

00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:10.313
Among the claims he made
in the video,

00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:13.483
the biggest problem is

00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:16.569
that you manipulated evidence
in 2017.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.196
Is that false?

00:31:19.447 --> 00:31:22.116
You cannot say it was manipulated.

00:31:22.742 --> 00:31:25.453
You were stopped
by a police officer.

00:31:26.246 --> 00:31:27.597
What about his claim
of your verbal violence

00:31:27.622 --> 00:31:29.290
that you'd delay it on purpose

00:31:29.415 --> 00:31:31.167
to give the minor suspect life?

00:31:31.292 --> 00:31:32.335
Is that false?

00:31:32.418 --> 00:31:33.461
Well,

00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:35.505
it depends on how you put it.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.190
So?
Have you ever said that before?

00:31:37.215 --> 00:31:39.801
So it depends on how you put it.

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.486
It was the former prosecutor
Lee Chang-joon

00:31:41.511 --> 00:31:43.221
who took you to
the Blue House, wasn't it?

00:31:43.346 --> 00:31:44.514
What was the reason?

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:46.891
What does that have to do
with this?

00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:49.227
Why do you keep bringing up
what happened in the past?

00:31:49.352 --> 00:31:50.478
Why else?

00:31:50.603 --> 00:31:53.314
It's not so common for someone to
cause issues everywhere he goes.

00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:56.109
You were interrogated, and
signs of unlawful act were found,

00:31:56.234 --> 00:31:57.777
but no action was taken.

00:31:57.902 --> 00:32:00.446
And this is the consequence
of no action being taken.

00:32:05.285 --> 00:32:06.703
The committee holds the authority

00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:09.497
to interrogate a witness related
to the disciplinary suspect.

00:32:09.622 --> 00:32:10.707
Are you aware of that?

00:32:11.165 --> 00:32:12.709
A witness related to me?

00:32:14.168 --> 00:32:16.045
Who's that?

00:32:16.671 --> 00:32:19.841
Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok was
the one who interrogated you.

00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:21.634
And the chief prosecutor
at the time was

00:32:22.176 --> 00:32:23.595
Prosecutor Kang Won-cheol, right?

00:32:25.555 --> 00:32:28.433
Are you saying

00:32:28.558 --> 00:32:32.312
you'll interrogate
Prosecutor Hwang because of me?

00:32:32.437 --> 00:32:34.897
Although Prosecutor Kang
has retired,

00:32:35.023 --> 00:32:37.900
we can still verify the facts
with him.

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:39.444

- Sir.

00:32:39.569 --> 00:32:41.696
I promise to give you
good news soon.

00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:44.866
I'll be the junior
you're proud to introduce.

00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.535
I can be one. Please wait.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.786
Please anything but that.

00:32:49.704 --> 00:32:50.788
You can't do that.

00:32:50.913 --> 00:32:53.082
- Sit down.
- Please.

00:32:53.207 --> 00:32:54.250
Sit down.

00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:55.418
Okay.

00:32:55.835 --> 00:32:57.670

However, before CEO Nam
makes a second disclosure.

00:33:09.223 --> 00:33:11.351
Before he discloses anything new,

00:33:11.976 --> 00:33:13.227

Yes.

to say about him.

No.

00:33:49.138 --> 00:33:50.740
Now that the girl's murderer
has been arrested,

00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:53.518
you should wrap it up.

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:57.480
You think he'd listen to me now?

00:33:58.481 --> 00:34:00.024
He's become obedient.

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:03.736
Obedient enough
to go to the police on his own?

00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.697
