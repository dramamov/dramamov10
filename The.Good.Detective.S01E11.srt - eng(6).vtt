[Episode 11]

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:10.613
I was holding back.

00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:14.100
I could've knocked him out,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.454
but I stopped myself.

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:17.683
Did you see it?

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.183
And why?

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:20.155
Why did you hold back?

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:21.483
Because I had to let him go.

00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:24.348
Why did you let him go when you almost had him?

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:28.363
Jo Seong Dae wouldn't have talked even if we had brought him in.

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:34.015
We wanted to let him go and see how Oh Jong Tae reacts to it.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:36.935
Getting Oh Jong Tae is more important to us.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:40.648
I get that, but why did you get this CCTV footage?

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:42.373
It only humiliates our team.

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:44.520
We're going to share this, so everyone can watch it.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.591
We're going to use it to pressure Jo Seong Dae and Oh Jong Tae.

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:51.982
So, you want to share a video of a suspect beating up a detective?

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:52.912
Yes.

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:54.677
Are you out of your mind?

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:57.004
It shows Jae Hong's face very clearly!

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.481
How is he supposed to work after this humiliation?

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.513
Well, we can blur his face out.

00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:04.762
Hey! Why would you blur out my face?

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:08.132
My face needs to be shown in the clip.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.677
I'm going to be a star soon.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:14.077
Right?

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:17.413

I'm going and then bam!

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:22.607
I was like Gandhi.

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.943
I was practicing brutal kindness.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:34.020
I still don't get it at all.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.631
If we get him and beat him down, he'll speak.

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.609
I don't understand why we have to wait.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.992
Someone like you wouldn't know how a master thinks.

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:48.443
We're giving a little to get a huge payout.

00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:52.681
People need to read more.

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.747
Hold on.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.887
Right here.

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.676
Is that where the appendix is?

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:06.106
Cut it.

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.816
Are you sure about this?

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:10.882
Cut it before the ambulance gets here.

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.525
Wait!

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:23.982
Are you scared?

00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:25.660
Do it boldly.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.122
I'll kill you if you leave a messed up scar.

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.889
Close your eyes.

Kwon Jae Hong from Violent Crimes Division Team 2 at Incheon's West Police Department.

00:02:48.692 --> 00:02:55.420
Your great commitment to your duty has been a role model for all the police.

00:02:56.856 --> 00:03:01.525
The police family are all desperately waiting for

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.819
your recovery so that you can be with us again.

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:12.566
I was just doing my job as an officer.

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:14.432
Thank you, Chief.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:18.303
Could you explain what was going on when he was fighting the suspect?

00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:19.903
Sure.

00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:25.681
When Detective Kwon faced the suspect,

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.275
his appendix had already ruptured.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:36.442
But he fought the suspect because he was so determined to arrest him.

00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:41.317
I've always worried about him because he doesn't take care of himself.

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:43.027
He always goes all in.

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:44.873
Thank you.

00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:47.175
Are you okay?

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.573
It feels like it's infected.

00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:50.973
Oh, really?

00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:52.105
Doctor!

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:53.705
Doctor!

[Sergeant Kwon Jae Hong gets wounded while chasing a murder suspect]

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.840
His appendix had already ruptured by the time he faced the suspect.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.715
But he fought the suspect because he was so determined to arrest him.

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.963
I'm not in any physical pain.

00:04:09.963 --> 00:04:18.141
But I'm so upset about the fact that the suspect escaped.

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:19.643
He's a real officer.

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:23.514
This is Jo Seong Dae, the main suspect in Park Geon Ho's murder,

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:26.768
which was previously closed as a suicide.

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:31.104
Our station is having an open investigation into Jo Seong Dae,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.885
who assaulted an officer with a ruptured appendix and got away.

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:38.017
We will put in all our effort in arresting him.

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:40.197
Have you obtained evidence for his crime?

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:44.055
We have confirmed on CCTV footage that he was near the scene.

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:47.532
And we found his blood residue at the scene.

00:04:47.532 --> 00:04:49.688
How is the assaulted officer doing?

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.389
He's currently in recovery.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.339
He's getting a lot of encouraging comments online

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:57.365
that have been helping him to find some peace.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:59.822
Do you know where the suspect is?

00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:00.747
Not yet.

00:05:00.747 --> 00:05:04.472
But it will be hard for him to escape from every officer

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:07.963
in the nation since it is now an open investigation.

00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:13.650
On my honor, I trust that the police will do our duty

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.850
to arrest Jo Seong Dae no matter what!

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:21.511
I ask the public to help the police─

00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:23.115
I'm starving.

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:24.967
I haven't eaten anything all night.

00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:28.537
Why do my eyes swell up whenever I pull an all-nighter?

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.995
Isn't Eun Hye up yet?

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:34.514
Is Eun Hye still asleep? We should wake her up then.

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:36.114
Eun Hye!

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:39.372
I'm back.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.556
Where did you go this early in the morning?

00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:44.926
She's just getting back now.

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:45.900
What do you mean?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.968
She pulled an all-nighter like you and is just getting back.

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:49.991
Is that true?

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.575
Did you really just get back now? What were you doing?

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:53.764
I had to work on something.

00:05:53.764 --> 00:05:56.498
Why would you pull an all-nighter to do something?

00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.153
Are you serious?

00:05:58.153 --> 00:06:00.453
How could you stay out all night?

00:06:00.453 --> 00:06:03.661
You should've called me if she was out all night.

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:05.096
You didn't do anything?

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.196
What if something had happened to her? Do you know how dangerous it is out there?

00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:10.006
She called and said she won't be home.

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:12.060
Then you should've asked her why!

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.646
Why were you out all night?

00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:18.040
Are you still hanging out with the kids from before?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.337
What?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.573
I can't hang out with them?

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:24.691
Like you said, all I have are bad friends.

00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:27.803
That's not what I meant.

00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:29.871
I'm just worried.

00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.654
You can hang out with friends.

00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:36.037
But give me your best friend's number, so I don't get too worried.

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:37.904
Why do I have to do that?

00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:39.099
Huh?

00:06:39.123 --> 00:06:42.747
I would need to call them if I can't reach you.

00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:44.522
I don't think that's the reason.

00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:46.865
Eun Hye, I just...

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:50.498
I just switched shifts with my co-worker who works nights because she was sick.

00:06:50.498 --> 00:06:51.583
Happy?

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:53.069
I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.320
Eun Hye, you should eat─

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.436
I'll eat this.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.825
Why would you eat cup noodles when there's food here? Eun Hye. Eun Hye!

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:04.178
Just let her be, you're not her father.

00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:06.161
What's up with her? Did you two get into a fight?

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:08.931
That's just how she usually is.

00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.525
She didn't expect that she would need to tell us about every little thing.

00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:17.005
Kids these days don't even give their friends' numbers to their real dads.

00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:20.615
And she feels better eating cup noodles because she's used to it.

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.788
What are you upset about?

00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:24.809
There's nothing weird about that.

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:27.534
I think you're the one who's acting weird.

00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:30.935
Stop pretending to be her dad when you don't even know how to be one.

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:35.236
You should first read up on how girls are.

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:39.732
No, you've never picked up a book in your life.

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.864
Just keep leading a difficult life like that

00:07:42.864 --> 00:07:44.396
for the rest of your life.

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.778
All by yourself.

Hey, is it that time of the month for her?

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:53.638
Are you kidding me?

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.438

You have the last one, right? Why haven't you sent it?

00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:13.442
I'm going to confirm it with the police before I send it.

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:14.170
Confirm what?

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.597
It's a recording file of the police. I need to confirm it with the auditing department.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:20.505
Will that be possible? It's obviously an illegal recording.

00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:22.005
Let me try it.

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:25.844
If I can't confirm it with them, then I'll write based on what's on the recording.

No, it will only take a second!

Just one question.

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:57.498
Did you investigate Chief Moon for bribery?

00:08:57.498 --> 00:08:59.832
Are you the one who recorded his conversation?

00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:01.448
Where did you hear that?

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:03.033
Who gave you that tip?

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.066
Excuse me?

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:07.644
I'll confirm it for you if you reveal your source first.

00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.767
No, we protect our sources─

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:14.549
If you want to come all the way here to confirm something,

00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:19.020
you should provide who, where, what,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.290
and why before asking whether a tip is correct or not.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.362

There are two options.

The easy option is for us to write the article

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.911
and reinvestigate Lee Dae Cheol's case from the beginning.

00:20:42.911 --> 00:20:48.044
There will be talks about a retrial, but that's none of my business.

The other option would be to push the executions up.

00:20:55.243 --> 00:20:58.054
Then the recording will become useless.

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:02.884
The choice will depend on how this meeting goes and how you decide, Minister.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.538
Use the recording to speed up the executions

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:16.651
and then expose it to provide grounds for abolishing the death sentence?

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:20.739
There's something else we'll gain from exposing the recording.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:24.472
It will humiliate the police and the prosecution.

the officer says that he would've released

I heard you met with the journalist who wrote the article a few days ago.

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:12.935
What did you tell her?

00:25:12.935 --> 00:25:15.268
No, I...

00:25:15.268 --> 00:25:17.556
I didn't tell her anything.

00:25:17.556 --> 00:25:20.181
You really didn't tell her anything?

00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:23.650
I didn't even know that the recording file existed.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.482
So what could I have possibly told her?

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:28.032
Right, I get that.

00:25:28.032 --> 00:25:29.915
What do you mean by that?

00:25:29.915 --> 00:25:34.336
I really didn't know anything about the recording file.

00:25:34.336 --> 00:25:35.855
I said I got it.

00:25:35.855 --> 00:25:38.398
You can go back to your work.

00:25:56.303 --> 00:26:02.210
Did your superior order you to give false testimony at the retrial

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.558
to hide the auditing department's illegal tapping?

00:26:06.558 --> 00:26:10.825
I thought you had done that because you were trying to hide your mistake.

00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:13.567
I understood it because you became a successful officer.

00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:18.896
But you let Lee Dae Cheol die just because of that?

00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:22.942
Just to help out your department?

00:26:23.563 --> 00:26:25.630
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

00:26:27.472 --> 00:26:31.124
You and I are on different paths.

00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:33.691
But you're still an officer.

00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:38.036
I know you only joined the force to climb the ladder, but you're still an officer!

00:26:38.036 --> 00:26:39.463
An officer like me.

00:26:39.463 --> 00:26:43.421
You weren't able to save Lee Dae Cheol in the end, either.

00:26:43.421 --> 00:26:47.747
You just foolishly headbutted into a rock and got yourself hurt.

00:26:47.747 --> 00:26:50.271
You only talked about how great you are.

00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:52.217
You didn't change anything.

00:26:52.217 --> 00:26:53.317
An officer?

00:26:53.317 --> 00:26:59.112
Do you think you're a hero because you catch thieves and killers?

00:26:59.112 --> 00:27:02.664
When I threatened you with disciplinary action,

00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:08.417
didn't you beg me to let you keep your badge?

00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:10.825
A sergeant at Incheon's West Police Department.

00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:13.876
That's all you are.

00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:16.457
Just do what your job calls for.

00:27:17.634 --> 00:27:19.443
Yoon Sang Mi.

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:23.305
Don't call me your seonbae anymore.

00:27:23.904 --> 00:27:26.407
I don't want a hoobae like you.

00:27:28.382 --> 00:27:30.026
Just go.

00:27:44.012 --> 00:27:47.455
You still got nothing to say?

00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:54.680
You're not thinking that Oh Jong Tae can get you out of this, are you?

00:27:55.224 --> 00:27:58.167
The evidence of your crime is too clear this time.

00:27:58.167 --> 00:27:59.670
You won't get out of this.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.928
You'll take on all the blame. Are you okay with that?

00:28:09.343 --> 00:28:11.555
He's not someone who'll talk.

00:28:11.555 --> 00:28:12.585
What are you going to do?

00:28:12.585 --> 00:28:17.305
I'm going to bring Oh Jong Tae as a witness and confront him.

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:19.085
Do you think he would come here?

00:28:19.085 --> 00:28:22.885
We'll ask him three times, and if he still doesn't come

00:28:23.617 --> 00:28:26.002
we'll arrest him.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.166
[Witness Summons]

00:28:46.184 --> 00:28:49.963
Jo Seong Dae, that punk. What is he waiting for?

00:28:49.963 --> 00:28:53.058
He thinks Oh Jong Tae is his last hope.

00:28:53.058 --> 00:28:55.126
Does Oh Jong Tae have that much power?

00:28:55.126 --> 00:28:58.381
Yoo Jeong Seok and Yoo Jeong Ryeol have his back.

00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:00.710
I think Jong Tae has something on them.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.659
I get that there was some corruption involved,

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:06.312
but would they try to get a killer out

00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:09.254
just because they received some money for the election?

00:29:09.254 --> 00:29:11.721
That doesn't sound too convincing.

00:29:11.721 --> 00:29:15.385
I'm sure they have a secret that we don't know about.

00:29:16.572 --> 00:29:22.593
Ah, yes. Reporter Jin is out of the office right now.

00:29:22.593 --> 00:29:25.475
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

00:29:27.127 --> 00:29:31.150
I guess there's another reporter named Reporter Jin at Jeonghan Daily News.

00:29:31.893 --> 00:29:34.053
What are you doing here?

00:29:34.053 --> 00:29:36.385
There must be a lot of people asking for you.

00:29:36.385 --> 00:29:38.103
You even turned your phone off.

00:29:38.103 --> 00:29:40.362
Things will quiet down in a few days.

00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:43.536
There were some threatening comments about the article too.

00:29:43.536 --> 00:29:44.936
Are you all right?

00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:48.580
I wouldn't be able to do my job if I paid attention to every single comment.

00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:50.938
Did you...

00:29:50.938 --> 00:29:54.500
Did you come here because you were worried about me?

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.470
I don't really worry about others.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.808
So, why are you here?

00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:01.629
Your article made things easier for our investigation.

00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:03.703
I didn't write that article to make things easier for you guys.

00:30:03.703 --> 00:30:06.769
But I'm sure you didn't write it just because you wanted to.

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:10.150
You wrote it because your boss said you could, right?

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:15.061
So, I came here to thank him.

00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:19.567
Hello, Senior Manager Yoo.

00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:21.009
Ah, who...?

00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:23.535
This is a detective from violent crimes at Incheon West Police Department.

00:30:23.535 --> 00:30:25.484
He wanted to thank us for the article.

00:30:25.484 --> 00:30:26.960
My name is Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.050
Jong Tae has told me a lot about you.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.092
Oh Jong Tae is my cousin.

00:30:32.092 --> 00:30:34.158
Ah, I see.

00:30:34.158 --> 00:30:36.089
Detective Oh, let's talk outside─

00:30:36.089 --> 00:30:38.922
I'm in a difficult position right now.

00:30:38.922 --> 00:30:42.406
Jong Tae is being investigated for conspiring to commit murder.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.504
And?

00:30:43.504 --> 00:30:45.012
What is up with you?

00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:46.168
You can talk to me instead.

00:30:46.168 --> 00:30:49.468
I heard you and Jong Tae are pretty close.

00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:52.758
He doesn't really listen to me.

00:30:52.758 --> 00:30:57.518
When you see him, could you talk to him for me?

00:30:57.518 --> 00:31:00.970
Tell him that he must pay for his crimes.

00:31:01.728 --> 00:31:03.420
Why would you say that to my boss?

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:05.110
Get out of here! Come on!

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.177
Please tell him.

00:31:07.177 --> 00:31:09.990
He's always like this.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.019
Let's go!

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:14.963
Come on!

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.410
Come on!

00:31:22.236 --> 00:31:25.888
Why are you talking to my boss like that?

00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:27.689
What would that make of me?

00:31:27.689 --> 00:31:31.729
If we don't get Jong Tae now, we'll never get him,

00:31:31.729 --> 00:31:33.928
and Lee Dae Cheol's case will be buried for good.

00:31:33.928 --> 00:31:35.828
Detective Oh.

00:31:35.828 --> 00:31:40.689
Do you seriously think my boss made a dirty deal with Oh Jong Tae?

00:31:40.689 --> 00:31:41.769
I have a strong suspicion.

00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.071
What about objective evidence?

00:31:43.071 --> 00:31:45.013
His brother is the Minister of Justice!

00:31:45.013 --> 00:31:47.040
He can get a killer out if he wants to.

00:31:47.064 --> 00:31:52.165
My senior manager isn't someone a lieutenant can mess with.

00:31:52.165 --> 00:31:54.637
And without any evidence at that!

00:31:54.637 --> 00:31:56.729
Then let's do this instead.

00:31:56.729 --> 00:31:59.361
I'll find the evidence, and you find the facts.

00:31:59.361 --> 00:32:01.815
We'll each finish our homework by the end of this week.

00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:02.880
Why should I?

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.240
Call me as soon as you finish your homework.

00:32:20.178 --> 00:32:25.464
The article you recently wrote about a death row inmate's victims' families...

00:32:25.464 --> 00:32:26.567
Someone ordered you to do it, right?

00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:28.828
Go interview the families of the victims.

00:32:28.828 --> 00:32:31.769
What that person wanted was Lee Dae Cheol.

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:33.508
The real killer isn't Oh Jong Tae.

00:32:33.508 --> 00:32:37.001
It should be someone with much more power than him.

00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:39.658
He has to shield him since he is his brother's Achilles heel.

00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:40.731
He has to shield him since he is his brother's Achilles heel.

00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:45.463
Wow, Oh Jong Tae had his hands on Yoo Jeong Ryeol and Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:50.060
You'll win if Lee Dae Cheol is found to be innocent?

00:32:55.094 --> 00:32:57.349
There's something I've been digging into.

00:32:57.349 --> 00:33:03.069
The central division has a case of an idol member involved with drugs,

00:33:03.069 --> 00:33:05.389
but they won't give the story to me.

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:07.717
They won't give it to us as an exclusive.

00:33:07.717 --> 00:33:10.162
Get a TV station and ask together

00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:12.166
under the condition that we're the only paper who gets the story.

00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:13.466
Okay.

00:33:13.466 --> 00:33:15.769
And let's ease off the police for now.

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:17.470
We've been on them too much.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.420
Yes, sir.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.919
Is there anything else to discuss?

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:23.216
Senior Manager, we got a complaint from the advertising department.

00:33:23.216 --> 00:33:25.956
Why did they talk to you? They should've talked to me directly.

00:33:25.956 --> 00:33:27.085
What's it about?

00:33:27.085 --> 00:33:29.000
It's a pretty big advertising sponsorship.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.257
But the company is Incheon Investment Trust.

00:33:32.257 --> 00:33:36.136
The company's CEO Oh Jong Tae would like to meet with you.

00:33:36.136 --> 00:33:37.301
Why does he want to see me?

00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:38.725
Senior Manager.

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:41.118
I would like to go with you.

00:33:42.433 --> 00:33:43.994
Why do you want to meet him?

00:33:43.994 --> 00:33:48.283
I've tried contacting him with stuff about the station, but he kept ignoring me.

00:33:48.283 --> 00:33:51.450
If you're not comfortable with seeing him, I'll go instead.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.940
Just set it up for me, please.

00:33:56.512 --> 00:33:58.778
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:33:58.778 --> 00:34:02.692
I'm glad because it would get rid of any source for misunderstandings.

00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:04.416
Yes.

00:34:05.657 --> 00:34:09.624
I'll pick a time and location and text it to you.

00:34:09.624 --> 00:34:11.376
Okay.

00:34:13.883 --> 00:34:17.682
Why don't you throw him some bait?

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:21.431
What kind of bait?

00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:25.140
Yoo Jeong Seok was at the scene five years ago.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.697
The day Detective Jang was murdered.

00:34:28.697 --> 00:34:30.970
At the scene of the crime.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.530
Why?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.060
Why was Yoo Jeong Seok at the crime scene?

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.517
He was there to meet someone.

00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:43.048
But it's almost the same location as the scene of the murder.

00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:45.208
And the time was the same too.

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:49.372
Are you saying that Yoo Jeong Seok killed Detective Jang?

00:34:49.396 --> 00:34:51.196
If he did,

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.252
he would take the bait.

00:34:58.245 --> 00:35:01.567
Now we're finally talking.

00:35:02.128 --> 00:35:04.103
Thank you, Doctor.

00:35:04.782 --> 00:35:06.849
I'll see you later.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.490
We don't need to come to the hospital anymore. I don't have any symptoms.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:21.365
The doctor said you have to keep taking your meds and monitor them (symptoms).

00:35:21.365 --> 00:35:25.089
He said keeping yourself calm is important. You heard him, right?

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:28.822
Don't get stressed and never drink or smoke.

00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:32.889
Hey, maybe you should quit your job too.

00:35:32.889 --> 00:35:36.220
You'll be in big trouble if you get worked up by a bad customer.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.509
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.

00:35:39.509 --> 00:35:40.727
It's because of your illness.

00:35:40.727 --> 00:35:43.018
Imagine if a pretty girl like you fainted in the streets.

00:35:43.018 --> 00:35:45.387
There are many bad guys these days.

00:35:45.387 --> 00:35:46.554
Ahjussi.

00:35:46.554 --> 00:35:47.740
What?

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.307
I've lived on my own for a long time.

00:35:51.307 --> 00:35:53.974
I'm not used to others nagging at me.

00:35:53.974 --> 00:35:55.764
Okay, got it.

00:35:55.764 --> 00:35:57.860
Then should we go eat?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.084
What do you like?

00:35:59.084 --> 00:36:00.292
I'll buy you something good.

00:36:00.292 --> 00:36:03.064
- I like eating by myself.
- By yourself?

00:36:03.064 --> 00:36:08.082
Okay, I got paid a lot for working overtime this month.

00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:10.232
I would like to buy you some clothes.

00:36:10.232 --> 00:36:11.832
Why?

00:36:11.832 --> 00:36:15.147
Why would you buy clothes for me?

00:36:15.147 --> 00:36:19.742
Well, then just tell me if you need something else other than clothes.

00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:23.542
I'm going to save up money to get a room on my own.

00:36:23.542 --> 00:36:30.311
All you have to do is just let me sleep at your house until then.

00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:31.873
Eun Hye.

00:36:31.897 --> 00:36:35.645
Are you uncomfortable with living with us?

00:36:36.578 --> 00:36:39.711
I keep thinking about my dad when I see you.

00:36:42.517 --> 00:36:45.535
Is it hard?

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:49.019
I'm sorry.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:52.602
I'm working the night shift again, so I need to get to work.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.200
Eun Hye, wait...

00:37:05.342 --> 00:37:09.257
I thought you'd be a guy because he said you were his hoobae colleague.

00:37:09.257 --> 00:37:11.680
We could move to a different place if you would like.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.056
No, it's fine.

00:37:14.056 --> 00:37:16.809
Spoken like a true journalist.

00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:20.090
Sometimes I come here to drink by myself.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.290
Don't get the wrong idea. This isn't bribery.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:27.114
Oh, if you don't want to drink, would you like some coffee or soda instead?

00:37:27.114 --> 00:37:29.535
No, I'll drink.

00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:34.786
It's nice to meet you two.

00:37:43.055 --> 00:37:45.119
You would like to help our paper?

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:46.619
Ah, yes.

00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:49.004
I'm thinking about starting a new business.

00:37:49.004 --> 00:37:55.647
I wanted to meet with you because I want to promote my business and return the favor.

00:37:55.647 --> 00:37:57.156
Return the favor?

00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:01.988
I haven't done anything that would call for you to return the favor.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.579
Oh.

00:38:04.579 --> 00:38:06.502
Wrong choice of words.

00:38:06.502 --> 00:38:11.080
I should call it apologizing for my mistake instead.

00:38:12.153 --> 00:38:13.453
CEO Oh.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:16.767
I have a few questions for you. Do you mind if I ask them here?

00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:18.249
What are they?

00:38:18.249 --> 00:38:21.315
A detective came to our office today.

00:38:21.315 --> 00:38:23.181
He said he was your cousin.

00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:25.281
Did you know about that?

00:38:26.588 --> 00:38:27.379
Yes.

00:38:27.379 --> 00:38:32.560
He said he suspects you of conspiring to commit murder.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.379
I think that's what she wanted to ask about.

00:38:37.888 --> 00:38:39.203
Is that what he said?

00:38:39.203 --> 00:38:40.963
You know who Jo Seong Dae is, right?

00:38:40.963 --> 00:38:43.753
He's the main suspect in Park Geon Ho's murder.

00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:46.118
And you know that Park Geon Ho was killed

00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:49.049
while claiming that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent.

00:38:49.049 --> 00:38:53.587
During Lee Dae Cheol's retrial, the defense pointed to you as the real killer.

00:38:53.587 --> 00:38:57.558
They've confirmed that the watch that was found at the scene was yours.

00:38:57.558 --> 00:39:02.206
And they claimed that the detective in charge helped you to get away with the murder.

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.006
Oh...

00:39:04.006 --> 00:39:07.547
So you're the one who wrote that article.

00:39:07.547 --> 00:39:12.166
If it's confirmed that you conspired to kill Park Geon Ho,

00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:16.745
it will prove that you were the real killer in Yoon Ji Seon and Jang Jin Soo's case.

00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:20.220
Do you have anything to say regarding that many charges?

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.271
So, Reporter Jin thinks that I'm the one who killed

00:39:27.271 --> 00:39:33.030
Yoon Ji Seon, Jang Jin Soo, and Park Geon Ho.

00:39:42.013 --> 00:39:48.496
If I did kill one of the three, the most plausible one would be Detective Jang.

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:50.170
Why?

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:55.403
Because he kept saying that I was the suspect even though I was innocent.

00:39:55.403 --> 00:39:59.640
Are you confessing right now that you killed Detective Jang?

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.080
You should tell the detectives to look into it.

00:40:02.104 --> 00:40:03.771
Maybe they'll find some evidence.

00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.371
That's enough.

00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:06.511
Senior Manager, I'm not done─

00:40:06.511 --> 00:40:08.411
I said that's enough.

00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:12.124
Thank you for the advertisement offer, CEO. We will accept it.

00:40:13.393 --> 00:40:14.318
Senior Manager.

00:40:14.318 --> 00:40:18.140
Let's go. You know the conversation today doesn't mean anything.

00:40:19.915 --> 00:40:22.811
We'll get going then.

00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:24.668
Sure.

00:40:27.303 --> 00:40:29.336
By the way, Senior Manager Yoo.

00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:32.436
Did you have a sister?

00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:38.161
I heard your sister had a bad experience with the police and killed herself.

00:40:38.161 --> 00:40:39.765
Is that true?

00:40:41.325 --> 00:40:44.592
You must have a big grudge against the police.

00:40:46.015 --> 00:40:51.214
Reporter Jin, don't trust everything that the police say.

00:40:51.214 --> 00:40:54.945
There are a lot of bad people among them.

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:16.871
It seemed like he was going to say something. Why did you stop me?

00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:18.983
I only met him because of the advertisement deal.

00:41:18.983 --> 00:41:21.257
That's enough. He won't reveal anything more.

00:41:21.257 --> 00:41:24.263
Then there was no reason for me to be there.

00:41:24.263 --> 00:41:26.824
Oh Jong Tae isn't someone who'll get played.

00:41:26.824 --> 00:41:28.548
You should end it here.

00:41:28.548 --> 00:41:30.315

Did Oh Jong Tae really kill Jang Jin Soo?

00:42:43.099 --> 00:42:46.465

Can you come out for a second?

00:43:11.573 --> 00:43:13.506

I was in the area so...

Yes. He's a famous troll.

00:43:40.347 --> 00:43:42.358
He only leaves vicious comments for female reporters.

00:43:42.358 --> 00:43:44.599

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:41.978
That will never happen.

00:50:41.978 --> 00:50:45.168
Countless people are waiting in line to eat with me.

00:50:45.168 --> 00:50:47.334
Okay, got it.

00:50:47.334 --> 00:50:49.363
Call me.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.795
- Are you going to get groceries?
- Yes.

00:51:14.795 --> 00:51:16.090
Where are you going to go?

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.653
Market.

00:51:17.653 --> 00:51:19.697
You don't need to go all the way there.

00:51:19.697 --> 00:51:22.521
You can just shop at the convenience store nearby.

00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:24.617
Do you know how expensive it is?

00:51:24.617 --> 00:51:26.416
They're double the market's prices.

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.188
Only kids go there.

00:51:28.188 --> 00:51:29.516
Why would I get groceries there?

00:51:29.516 --> 00:51:32.029
But still...

00:51:33.244 --> 00:51:35.185
You want me to buy stuff at Eun Hye's store?

00:51:35.185 --> 00:51:37.643
It's not as expensive as you think.

00:51:37.643 --> 00:51:39.036
There are a lot of varieties too.

00:51:39.036 --> 00:51:41.403
Especially booze. The thing you love.

00:51:41.403 --> 00:51:45.111
We feed her, let her sleep here,

00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:49.253
and now you want me to increase the sales at her work?

00:51:49.877 --> 00:51:51.377
Why?

00:51:51.377 --> 00:51:53.252
Why should I do that?

00:51:53.252 --> 00:51:58.120
- Why do we need to care for her like that?
- I'm just—

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:03.152
If you have time to care for someone else's child, you should take care of your nephew!

00:52:03.152 --> 00:52:07.580
Shouldn't you go meet with him as his uncle, since I can't go see him?

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.763
Why do you think I'm getting groceries?

00:52:09.763 --> 00:52:15.687
I'm trying to make some dishes that Jae Hong likes, so I can mail them to him.

00:52:15.687 --> 00:52:20.392
You used to love him so much. Have you cut him out of your life now?

00:52:20.392 --> 00:52:24.257
Is he a stranger now that I'm divorced?

00:52:25.047 --> 00:52:28.197
I think about Jae Hong all the time.

00:52:28.197 --> 00:52:30.159
I've just been busy.

00:52:30.159 --> 00:52:33.174
Jae Hong is my son, no matter what anyone says.

00:52:34.114 --> 00:52:37.115
I gave birth to him.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:54.280
Come here.

00:52:54.282 --> 00:52:55.882
Jae Hong!

00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:58.569
Jae Hong!

00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:06.166
What happened to your face?

00:53:11.048 --> 00:53:14.569
Are you sure your dad didn't hit you?

00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:16.633
Is that true?

00:53:16.633 --> 00:53:19.070
I got into a fight with some kids at school today.

00:53:19.094 --> 00:53:20.733
Really?

00:53:21.899 --> 00:53:22.924
Why?

00:53:22.924 --> 00:53:26.821
They just keep giving me a hard time.

00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:28.891
I didn't do anything to them.

00:53:28.915 --> 00:53:31.759
Those damn kids.

00:53:31.759 --> 00:53:33.101
Did you hit them too?

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:34.150
No.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.232
They're a lot stronger than me.

00:53:36.232 --> 00:53:37.747
Hey, Kim Jae Hong!

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.520
You don't know what you've got.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.484
You're Kang Eun Hui's son, right?

00:53:43.484 --> 00:53:47.387
Your mom fought 17 people by herself in school and destroyed them.

00:53:47.387 --> 00:53:50.521
She didn't have a single cut on her face.

00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:51.510
Really?

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.710
Of course!

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.310
Your mom is a judo gold medalist.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:57.833
There was no one in this country who could win against her.

00:53:57.833 --> 00:54:01.918
She'd throw them into the air as soon as she grabbed them.

00:54:01.918 --> 00:54:04.075
You should build up some confidence and fight them.

00:54:04.075 --> 00:54:06.676
Destroy all the kids who mess with you!

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:08.771
You're more than capable of doing that!

00:54:08.771 --> 00:54:10.856
You're Kang Eun Hui's son.

00:54:14.313 --> 00:54:19.347
Don't be too upset that you can't see your mom often.

00:54:19.347 --> 00:54:25.445
A judo gold medalist's blood runs through you.

00:54:25.445 --> 00:54:31.135
Your mom will always be inside of you.

00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:32.554
Got it?

00:54:32.554 --> 00:54:34.246
Yes.

00:54:36.591 --> 00:54:41.025
Let me know if there's anything else you want to eat after you finish that.

00:54:41.025 --> 00:54:43.357
I'll get it for you.

00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:47.891
Eat this too.

00:54:47.891 --> 00:54:49.657
Have both of the cokes.

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:57.416
You're sure we've sent the summons three times, right?

00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.150
And we've confirmed that he has received them?

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:00.784
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

00:55:00.784 --> 00:55:03.945
Make sure you tell him his charges when you arrest him!

00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:05.245
I said I got it!

00:55:05.245 --> 00:55:07.835
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to Oh Ji Hyeok!

00:55:07.835 --> 00:55:09.959
You've never followed protocol!

00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:12.354
You just arrest them.

00:55:12.354 --> 00:55:15.393
Hey, make sure you follow every step of the protocol

00:55:15.393 --> 00:55:18.443
so Oh Jong Tae's lawyer won't have anything on us.

00:55:18.443 --> 00:55:20.367
Yes, sir.

00:55:20.367 --> 00:55:21.408
Let's go.

00:55:21.408 --> 00:55:22.742
Protocols, my ass.

00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:25.207
I'm going to beat him up and bring him in.

00:55:25.207 --> 00:55:26.412
What?

00:55:26.412 --> 00:55:27.671
What did he just say?

00:55:27.671 --> 00:55:30.067
You better not do that!

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.983
Wow, you look like a real detective in here.

00:55:42.062 --> 00:55:44.429
And you look like a real criminal.

00:55:58.936 --> 00:56:04.745
He doesn't look anxious at all.

00:56:06.647 --> 00:56:09.783
Let's give him some time.

00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:12.273
So he can read what's going on here.

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:21.503
Have some tea while you wait.

00:56:21.527 --> 00:56:26.460
The detectives are working on another case because they just arrested the suspect.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.960
- Strike him out!
- Good defense.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.120
- Lee Dae Hyung (retired Korean outfielder)!
- No.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:41.400
- All right.
- Come on. Let's go!

00:56:47.573 --> 00:56:50.939
You should watch it too if you're bored.

00:56:50.939 --> 00:56:52.093
Wait a little bit more.

00:56:52.093 --> 00:56:54.715
Hey, just watching is not so much fun.

00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:56.780
Let's bet 10,000 won (~$10) on the score.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.320
- Deal!
- Sounds good!

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.300
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'm in.

00:57:10.486 --> 00:57:12.843
My goodness, my apologies.

00:57:12.843 --> 00:57:14.543
Sorry for the long wait.

00:57:15.547 --> 00:57:19.945
We're usually not busy during this time, but we had a lot of work today.

00:57:19.945 --> 00:57:21.592
Please have a seat.

00:57:27.393 --> 00:57:30.363
I'm really sorry. I know you're a busy man.

00:57:30.387 --> 00:57:31.445
Let's hurry this up.

00:57:31.445 --> 00:57:33.445
Sure.

00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:37.299
I'm sure you have an idea of what this is about,

00:57:37.299 --> 00:57:38.867
but we've arrested Jo Seong Dae.

00:57:38.867 --> 00:57:42.680
It seems like he has no intention of confessing his crime.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.131
You know him, right?

00:57:44.155 --> 00:57:47.707
I don't know him.

00:57:47.707 --> 00:57:50.710
He said he knows you. I wonder why you don't know him.

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:54.375
He said you two were very close.

00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:58.717
He said he did a lot of business with you, and you had drinks together quite a few times.

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:00.541
Me?

00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:03.460
Do I look like I would hang out with someone like him?

00:58:03.484 --> 00:58:06.084
Me and that piece of trash?

00:58:08.722 --> 00:58:13.033
We'll be able to figure out what the truth is if you two talk to each other.

00:58:13.057 --> 00:58:14.757
Hold on.

00:58:16.237 --> 00:58:17.706
Bring in Jo Seong Dae.

00:58:17.706 --> 00:58:19.406
What?

00:58:19.406 --> 00:58:22.877
Are you trying to have us confront each other without my permission?

00:58:22.877 --> 00:58:25.362
All you have to do is look at his face and tell me if you know him.

00:58:25.362 --> 00:58:28.526
We need to hurry up. You've been waiting for a long time.

00:58:30.477 --> 00:58:32.394
Hey, Seong Dae.

00:58:33.048 --> 00:58:34.773
Sit here.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.630
You said you know me?

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:53.237
Jo Seong Dae, you remember that we saved you from dying in a container, right?

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.849
Who do you think tried to kill you?

00:58:56.849 --> 00:58:59.449
What are you talking about?

00:58:59.449 --> 00:59:03.239
I came to give a statement as a witness.

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:05.639
Detective Oh asked you a question!

00:59:06.797 --> 00:59:08.288
Who tried to kill you?

00:59:08.288 --> 00:59:09.895
We saw it with our own eyes.

00:59:09.895 --> 00:59:12.519
You're still going to deny it?

00:59:26.893 --> 00:59:30.037
Why are you looking at him?

00:59:30.569 --> 00:59:33.323
Are you saying CEO Oh tried to kill you?

00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:35.023
I don't know.

00:59:35.023 --> 00:59:38.916
How would a piece of trash like me know that?

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:42.943
He's probably the one who told you to kill Park Geon Ho.

00:59:42.967 --> 00:59:45.365
And he tried to kill you because he didn't

00:59:45.365 --> 00:59:48.551
want you to talk about him if you got caught.

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:51.302
Why do you keep looking at him?

00:59:51.302 --> 00:59:52.453
We're asking you a question!

00:59:52.477 --> 00:59:54.426
That's enough!

00:59:57.157 --> 01:00:00.557
You guys are really making things difficult for me.

01:00:01.463 --> 01:00:03.858
I'll ask him myself.

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:12.828
Hey, did I try to kill you?

01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:22.405
And am I also the one who told you to kill Park Geo Ho?

01:00:29.774 --> 01:00:32.954
Answer the question! Yes or no!

01:00:32.954 --> 01:00:36.270
I shouldn't have to get humiliated like this.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.894
Hurry up and answer the question.

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:42.127
It was you.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.366
That's just his one-sided claim.

01:00:52.366 --> 01:00:54.761
I've told you that I don't know him.

01:00:54.761 --> 01:00:55.762
That's right.

01:00:55.762 --> 01:00:59.392
You'll have to talk to my lawyer from now on.

01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:02.012
Of course. We will.

01:01:02.012 --> 01:01:03.857
And lastly,

01:01:03.857 --> 01:01:07.952
I'll say one thing to Detective Oh Ji Hyeok.

01:01:08.695 --> 01:01:12.095
I already knew that your memory was bad.

01:01:12.095 --> 01:01:18.893
But you'll have to remember what you said to me before.

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:35.761
Remember what you said.

01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:37.476
Got it?

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:50.660
[The People's Police, A Righteous Republic of Korea]

01:01:50.662 --> 01:01:53.583
We finally got him!

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.210
We're not done yet.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.210
This is just the beginning.

01:01:57.904 --> 01:02:01.423
Look at that guy.

01:02:13.185 --> 01:02:14.862
What was her name? Jin Seo Kyeong?

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:16.721
She was pretty feisty.

01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:19.611
Did you talk to her after you left?

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.422
Not really.

01:02:21.422 --> 01:02:23.980
I was a bit flustered at the time.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.343
She hit me from out of nowhere.

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:31.259
Are you going to keep treating me like this?

01:02:31.259 --> 01:02:34.534
Will you be okay with having me as your enemy?

01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:38.001
Your brother became the Minister of Justice,

01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:43.254
so I think it's the perfect time for you to take over.

01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:46.864
I might be able to help you with that.

01:02:58.436 --> 01:03:03.256
Now we're partners.

01:03:39.118 --> 01:03:41.018
Hello?

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:44.791
The lawyer wanted more pictures of the scene.

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:48.318
I'll submit a request for an arrest warrant when I get back.

01:03:48.342 --> 01:03:49.942
Okay.

You can't die yet. You have to pay for what you did first.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.525
Get out of my life!

01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:38.461
There must be someone helping him like you said. This wouldn't make sense otherwise.

01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:39.834
Oh Jong Tae is a murderer.

01:04:39.858 --> 01:04:41.248
Why are you protecting him?

01:04:41.272 --> 01:04:46.393
Why are you letting people like him come here and spew nonsense at me?

01:04:47.136 --> 01:04:49.901
Your cup is too small to receive my drink.

You made a deal with Lee Dae Cheol beforehand, right? What did he offer you?

01:04:56.098 --> 01:04:58.584
Who told you to do this?

01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:01.438
Senior Manager, what the hell happened here?

01:05:01.438 --> 01:05:05.605
I want to find the person who killed Jang Jin Soo.
