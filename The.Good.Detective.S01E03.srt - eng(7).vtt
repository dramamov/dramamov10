00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.089
She has epilepsy.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.370
We'll have to run some tests to find the cause,

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.761
but in most cases, you can't find the exact cause.

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.066
It's a simple partial seizure.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.957
If she takes her meds, it will be better controlled.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.189
Yes, sir.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.266
Got it.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.147
Yes, sir.

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:33.016
Please admit her.

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.753
It's not severe enough to be admitted.

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.362
She can go after her IV infusion.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.542
Admit her.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.550
Excuse me, but her illness doesn't require hospitalization.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.459
A doctor shouldn't assume everything about the patient's illness.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:48.916
The cause is unknown.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.032
You need to investigate.

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:52.265
That's the reason for admission.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.780
The beef tastes good when you eat it at a time like this. Here.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.472
Why does everyone look so tense?

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.230
Do I make you that uncomfortable?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.932
That's not it.

00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:17.928
It's not because of you, sir.

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:21.153
Everyone, forget about the case and just enjoy the food.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:24.346
How often do you get to stuff yourself on expensive beef?

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:25.870
Sir.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.080
What?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.269
About Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:31.189
What is it this time?

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.058
What are you hung up on now?

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:36.339
Well, this time,

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:38.323
I don't think I can let it go.

00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:39.323
Hey, Do Chang!

00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:43.414
The chief came here to say thanks for all of your hard work.

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:45.716
Why do you have to ruin the mood—

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.550
- Violent Crime Team 2.
- Yes, sir.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.609
You bunch of idiots.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.534
It's hard for me to be nice to you guys.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:53.789
Do you know why?

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.169
It's because one of you guys acts like a fool.

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:00.706
He's making the rest of you look like idiots.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:02.438
Got that?

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.066
Are you following me?

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.791
Yeah.

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:08.908
Why?

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:12.278
You guys got what you wanted.

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:14.102
Not yet.

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:16.598
There's something you need to do.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:20.878
We need your testimony to lock up Park Geon Ho.

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.510
No. I'm done with giving testimony.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.834
I was worried you might say that.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:30.104
But you made things easy for me because you messed up.

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:34.342
Once your treatment is done, I can take you in. For theft.

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:35.997
How petty.

00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:38.988
The doctor said you need about a week of treatment.

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:41.288
So make sure you get all the rest you need.

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:44.790
I'm going to take you right when you get discharged.

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:49.159
Thanks. I'll be back.

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:50.432
Yes, sir. Wait—

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.448
What is she charged with?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.840
She's not being charged with anything.

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.797
This is to protect a witness.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:13.457
I wanted to have a nice dinner to improve my image.

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:16.346
But you guys ruined it again.

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.659
Keep it up.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.650
Let's see who gets hurt in the end.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.777
Kang Do Chang.

00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:27.230
This is why you can never succeed, you idiot.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.179
Your much younger juniors are climbing the ladder.

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.893
But you're still out in the field without a captain's badge.

00:03:35.988 --> 00:03:37.888
Chief.

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:38.988
- Sir!
- No.

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.042
- I don't feel like drinking anymore.
- Come on, sir.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.732
You can't just leave like this.

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:51.423
You've totally changed after becoming chief.

00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:52.316
What?

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:56.394
I said some crap because I've been dealing with Park Geon Ho all day.

00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.269
You can't just let it slide?

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.167
You used to let it slide when your juniors got angry.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.530
Fine.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.879
You can go if you want.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.948
We'll have more fun anyway. Hey, pass around the drinks.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.875
Drink up.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.956
Pour me a shot!

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:16.917
What are you waiting for? Just go before you ruin the mood!

00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:18.641
Hey!

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:23.483
Are you pissed?

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.534
Pissed? Whatever.

00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:29.754
You drive me nuts.

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:32.900
Why are you being so stubborn for?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.926
You're making me say harsh things.

00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:38.953
A man should change a little as he ages.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:41.382
I know

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:43.453
I need to change.

00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:46.170
That's how you survive.

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:51.852
Hey.

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:53.714
Everyone, change your glasses.

00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:55.509
Let's drink up tonight!

Have a shot.

Drink up.

Everyone!

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:22.253
The best idiots at our station!

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:29.870
You know I love you guys, right?

00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:31.494
Yes, sir.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.126
Violent Crime Team Two's Kang Do Chang!

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:39.069
You...

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:44.928
He's the best cop I've ever known.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.051
He's really the best! Do you know that?

00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:50.010
- Yes, sir.
- No, you don't.

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.328
I'm heading out.

00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:56.264
Goodbye, sir!

Bong Sik.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.840
Take the guys and drink up like there's no tomorrow.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.956
Don't worry about the cost, got it?

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:05.012
Thank you, sir!

00:06:05.012 --> 00:06:06.283
Have a safe ride home!

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.340
- Please take good care of him!
- Bye!

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.239
Goodbye, sir!

00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:14.978
Hey!

00:06:14.978 --> 00:06:18.891
You guys should learn a little something from the chief.

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:25.950
Hyeongnim, I like you a hundred times more than Chief Moon who is just all talk!

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.261
What's wrong with you?

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:30.542
I love him the most!

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.251
Get off me!

00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:35.189
Hyeongnim, I don't care about the chief.

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:37.915
I'm going to become a detective like you.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:39.172
Shut up.

00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:43.106
This is why he thinks you're idiots.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:44.109
Hey!

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:46.629
What took you so long? I called you a long time ago!

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.843
The chief already left!

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.770
I'm sorry, my work took some time.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.595
Wow, isn't our Detective Oh so cool?

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:58.593
"Y'all can kiss up to the chief."

00:06:58.593 --> 00:07:02.932
"I'm going to go my own way!"

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.831
He lives in a different world than us.

00:07:06.855 --> 00:07:09.859
He's so different.

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:13.310
Bur shouldn't we reinvestigate?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.660
Hey! Didn't you see the chief earlier?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.632
But we should look into it since we got a tip.

00:07:22.573 --> 00:07:26.292
Hey, why did you guys become cops?

00:07:27.144 --> 00:07:29.362
You're just trying to make a living.

00:07:29.362 --> 00:07:32.143
It will be over for you if you touch the case again.

00:07:32.143 --> 00:07:34.294
We'll all be dead.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:39.420
It came to my email, so I'm the only one who saw it.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.463
You guys can forget about it.

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:43.910
- Hyeongnim!
- Hey!

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:46.089
- We need to go for a second round.
- I'm good.

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:47.473
Hey, Jae Hong, get him a cab.

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:50.114
I got him. Hyeongnim, this way.

00:07:51.153 --> 00:07:53.112
This way.

00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:55.558
- Bye!
- Take care!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.460
Let's go for round two!

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.105
Let's go!

00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:08.595
Okay, when is the execution date?

00:08:10.317 --> 00:08:13.029
It's coming up soon.

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:15.799
Is Lee Dae Cheol on the list too?

00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:17.439
Yeah.

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:21.365
Okay. Thanks.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.362
The death row convict Lee Dae Cheol is innocent.

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:52.996
He's been wrongfully accused of being a killer for the past five years.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.706
Do you know Lee Dae Cheol?

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:58.558
I put him in prison as a death row convict when I was the head of the crime department.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:00.058
He's...

00:09:01.003 --> 00:09:02.621
innocent.

[The crime took place on November 3, 2015 at 03:00]

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.112
It came to your email?

00:09:30.338 --> 00:09:32.515
Just forget about it.

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:34.529
It will be better for you.

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.814
I don't want to get on the chief's bad side already.

00:09:37.814 --> 00:09:39.509
But won't it be hard for you?

00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:42.753
What? What will be hard for me?

00:09:42.753 --> 00:09:44.078
Letting it go.

00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:45.289
Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:49.821
You've never felt a little bit iffy after arresting a suspect?

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:53.416
No detective in this world would be able to sleep

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:57.006
if we thought about every little thing like that.

00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:58.488
I know.

00:09:58.488 --> 00:10:00.120
You have a hard time falling asleep, right?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.787
Why do you assume I have a hard time falling asleep?

00:10:03.787 --> 00:10:07.290
You can try all you want from down here.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.579
But you won't be able to do anything if your superior says no.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.593
It will only drive you mad, got it?

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:15.003
So what's the point?

00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:16.588
You can see how it's going to end.

00:35:52.438 --> 00:35:54.860
It's better not to be here at a time like that.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.386
I'll get it handled while you're away.

00:35:58.386 --> 00:36:02.440
So don't think about anything and just go fishing.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.461
Got it?

00:36:04.461 --> 00:36:05.608
Yes, sir.

00:36:05.608 --> 00:36:07.397
You can go now.

00:36:11.522 --> 00:36:13.122
Do Chang.

00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:17.461
The most dangerous thing to do at a time like this is to get ahead of yourself.

00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:19.461
Don't cross the line.

00:36:28.593 --> 00:36:30.593
Yeah.

00:36:30.593 --> 00:36:32.790
I'm just a salary man.

00:36:33.616 --> 00:36:37.064
Let's take it easy

00:36:39.868 --> 00:36:43.740
The Department of Justice has officially announced the execution order.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.541
The chief of the department held a press conference this morning

00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:52.028
and announced that the execution order of 12 death row inmates including Jo Byeong Gil

00:36:52.028 --> 00:36:54.489
has been sent to each prison.

00:36:54.489 --> 00:36:57.645
The death row inmates who will be executed

00:36:57.645 --> 00:37:00.662
include Jo Byeong Gil, who killed 11 people 7 years ago,

00:37:00.662 --> 00:37:04.520
Park In Seo, who shocked the world with a murder of a child,

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.412
and Yoo Jin Yong, who killed his own father.

00:37:08.412 --> 00:37:11.544
The department has stated that the executions will go

00:37:11.544 --> 00:37:14.910
as planned if there are no special circumstances.

00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:17.226
There's nothing to see.

00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:19.024
It's not something we need to worry about.

00:37:19.024 --> 00:37:23.094
It's natural for death row inmates to be executed.

00:37:23.094 --> 00:37:24.494
Right?

00:37:24.494 --> 00:37:27.733
Ji Woong, is Lee Dae Cheol on the list?

00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:29.365
Yes, he is.

00:37:29.365 --> 00:37:30.700
Fuck.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.715
Hey, I...

00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:38.297
got vacation leave.

00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:41.150
The chief wants me to take a break.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.923
Bye.

00:37:50.428 --> 00:37:51.502
What are you guys doing?

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.983
It's time to do your job, now that you've had your lunch.

00:37:53.983 --> 00:37:56.845
Everyone get up.

00:37:56.845 --> 00:37:58.670
Let's go day drink.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.700
What?

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.300
What?

00:38:02.933 --> 00:38:04.166
I want to come too.

00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:07.453
I feel like drinking too.

00:38:08.848 --> 00:38:10.415
Detective Sim.

00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:14.153
Do you have the file that was sent to Detective Kang's email yesterday?

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.820
Let's go.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.690
Keep going.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.820
Hurry up.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.350
Come on, hurry up.

00:38:39.355 --> 00:38:41.555
Excuse me.

00:38:41.555 --> 00:38:43.208
Could I borrow you for a second?

00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:45.721
I was just talking to a detective.

00:38:45.721 --> 00:38:46.863
A detective?

00:38:46.863 --> 00:38:48.587
Yes.

00:39:04.505 --> 00:39:07.503
Do you have a place to go if you quit being a cop?

00:39:07.503 --> 00:39:09.027
No.

00:39:09.027 --> 00:39:11.746
That's why I came back.

00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:13.198
Then stay out of this.

00:39:13.222 --> 00:39:15.890
I just boarded the bus, and you want me to get off?

00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:20.316
Let's ride together.

00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:22.228
Until the last stop.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.530
Psychopath.

00:39:31.058 --> 00:39:34.524
Why are you standing here alone, trying to look cool?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.530
Come on, let's go.

00:39:38.534 --> 00:39:43.454
Are you sure that Detective Jang Jin Soo is the one who got the footage five years ago?

00:39:43.454 --> 00:39:44.403
I'm sure.

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:47.170
I even saw Jang Jin Soo's business card.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:52.210
That means Detective Jang knew that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.421
Why did he hide it?

00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:57.817
I'm sure he wanted to have Lee Dae Cheol as the killer.

00:39:57.817 --> 00:40:01.150
Jang Jin Soo was my friend. He wouldn't do that.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:05.497
Team Leader Nam and Detective Jang were partners back then, right?

00:40:05.497 --> 00:40:06.498
Nam Gook Hyeon?

00:40:06.498 --> 00:40:08.700
Won't we get an answer if we ask Team Leader Nam?

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.062
If he had something to say, he would've told me five years ago.

00:40:16.683 --> 00:40:18.642
Reporter Jin!

00:40:18.642 --> 00:40:20.302
What are you doing here?

00:40:20.302 --> 00:40:24.102
I guess the email I received was also sent to you.

00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:28.393
I think it was Kim Gi Tae.

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:30.390
You're right.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.647
He did tell you that Lee Dae Cheol is innocent.

00:40:33.647 --> 00:40:38.795
He was in a position where he could acquire that kind of file five years ago.

00:40:38.795 --> 00:40:43.315
Are you talking about the district attorney general who was sent to prison recently?

00:40:43.315 --> 00:40:46.063
The person in front of you is the one who dug up

00:40:46.063 --> 00:40:49.346
his corruption and sent him to prison.

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:51.253
I met with Park Geon Ho this morning.

00:40:51.253 --> 00:40:53.415
He was booked without detention and got released.

00:40:53.415 --> 00:40:55.972
Already? Those jerks.

00:40:55.972 --> 00:40:57.761
Park Geon Ho was telling the truth.

00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:00.026
He sincerely believed in Lee Dae Cheol's innocence.

00:41:00.026 --> 00:41:01.955
Don't trust him. He's full of shit.

00:41:01.955 --> 00:41:04.861
Two people are claiming that Lee Dae Cheol is innocent.

00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:07.854
Kim Gi Tae and Park Geon Ho.

00:41:07.854 --> 00:41:10.311
What the two have in common is that they won't gain

00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:13.006
anything from Lee Dae Cheol being found innocent.

00:41:13.006 --> 00:41:15.862
And what they have in common is

00:41:15.862 --> 00:41:20.462
that they have a lot to lose if Lee Dae Cheol is found innocent.

00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:24.600
Who do you think I should believe?

00:41:26.055 --> 00:41:29.630
You know that Lee Dae Cheol is on the list for execution, right?

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:35.968
If the execution goes as planned, even though Lee Dae Cheol is innocent,

00:41:35.968 --> 00:41:39.454
wouldn't the two of you live the rest of your lives feeling guilty?

00:41:39.454 --> 00:41:41.154
Why?

00:41:42.492 --> 00:41:46.220
We wouldn't be able to do our work if we get hung up on unnecessary emotions.

00:42:54.877 --> 00:42:56.525
Why are you alone?

00:42:56.525 --> 00:42:57.908
Where's the other guy?

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.408
He said he would be here.

00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:03.920
But I think he changed his mind.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.980
I don't think he wants to see you.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.087
Who is it?

00:43:07.087 --> 00:43:09.101
Can you just talk to me instead?

00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:10.968
You just need to tell me how much you want.

00:43:10.968 --> 00:43:13.455
Hyeongnim, think about it carefully.

00:43:13.455 --> 00:43:17.004
The only information I can give to the police is your name.

00:43:17.004 --> 00:43:23.011
In other words, no one will know who he is if you disappear.

00:43:23.011 --> 00:43:27.682
You have to show me his face for your own safety.

00:43:27.682 --> 00:43:30.709
And it will give me an advantage too.

00:43:36.472 --> 00:43:39.105
Is he the real killer?

00:43:39.105 --> 00:43:42.090
Is that why he told me to kill Lee Dae Cheol?

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.086
I'll try to persuade him.

00:43:49.732 --> 00:43:52.311
He knows how crazy you are.

00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:55.549
So I'm sure he'll come to meet you out of fear.

00:45:47.546 --> 00:45:49.810
You're not going to write the article just yet, right?

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.955
No. It's not something I can touch on without being sure.

00:45:51.955 --> 00:45:53.479
Right.

00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:56.307
We're not sure that Lee Dae Cheol is innocent yet.

00:45:56.307 --> 00:45:58.126
- Let's be careful.
- Yeah.

00:45:58.126 --> 00:46:03.083
From now on, you should discuss with us before meeting anyone related to this case.

00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:04.161
Why should I?

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:07.129
Your poking around will hinder our investigation.

00:46:07.129 --> 00:46:08.030
What?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.573
Why would you put it like that?

00:46:10.573 --> 00:46:11.907
What he means is—

00:46:11.907 --> 00:46:13.726
You don't have to sugarcoat it.

00:46:13.726 --> 00:46:16.451
You're telling me to stay out of it because it won't do the

00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:19.653
police any good to have Lee Dae Cheol's case flipped over, right?

00:46:19.653 --> 00:46:25.306
I'm saying that your ambition to get the exclusive will hinder our investigation.

00:46:25.306 --> 00:46:27.668
Do you know why Park Geon Ho did that

00:46:27.668 --> 00:46:30.563
and didn't trust the police?

00:46:30.563 --> 00:46:32.772
It's because you don't think about the victim,

00:46:32.772 --> 00:46:35.538
but how to make sure the police look good.

00:46:35.538 --> 00:46:38.475
Did you believe Park Geon Ho so easily because you're looking

00:46:38.475 --> 00:46:42.227
at it from the perspective of a reporter who wants an exclusive?

00:46:43.628 --> 00:46:48.652
Park Geon Ho tried to kill Lee Dae Cheol in prison.

00:46:49.795 --> 00:46:52.642
But Lee Dae Cheol lied about it.

00:46:52.642 --> 00:46:56.002
That's when Park Geon Ho saw who Lee Dae Cheol really is.

00:46:56.002 --> 00:46:58.136
Why are you telling me this now?

00:46:58.136 --> 00:47:02.306
We promised to work together on this.

00:47:02.306 --> 00:47:04.818
Because there's someone I can't trust yet.

00:47:04.818 --> 00:47:08.721
And that person hates having reporters around.

00:47:08.721 --> 00:47:12.441
Hey, did you say something rude to her?

00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:18.462
This is Jin Seo Kyeong.

00:47:18.462 --> 00:47:21.765
I met him.

00:47:21.765 --> 00:47:23.170
I took a picture of him.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.376
Hello? Park Geon Ho?

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:26.559
It's you, right?

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:29.696
I don't have time to talk. I'll send you the picture first.

00:47:29.696 --> 00:47:30.696
Hello?

00:47:30.696 --> 00:47:32.812
Hello?

00:47:32.812 --> 00:47:34.380
What's wrong?

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.848
What about Park Geon Ho?

00:47:35.848 --> 00:47:40.211
Park Geon Ho told me he was going to meet the real killer in Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:43.340
He said he's going to send me a picture of him right now.

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:13.720
Didn't you say he was going to send it right away?

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:25.000
He's not picking up?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.431
Hyeongnim.

00:48:26.431 --> 00:48:28.932
I found out where he was calling from.

00:48:39.336 --> 00:48:41.689
We'll enter the zone where his call came from soon.

00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:43.298
He'll be here within a 1 km radius.

00:48:43.298 --> 00:48:46.522
We can go straight to him when he calls.

00:48:46.522 --> 00:48:49.709
Ah, I hope we're not getting played again.

00:48:50.225 --> 00:48:52.825
Why won't he send the picture?

00:48:52.825 --> 00:48:55.861
Maybe he doesn't trust Reporter Jin yet.

00:48:58.364 --> 00:49:03.489
Or he didn't have the time to send the picture.

00:49:35.214 --> 00:49:37.671
Damn it.

00:49:40.074 --> 00:49:42.527
Don't touch the body until the investigators come.

00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:44.051
Yes, sir.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.210
Ahjumma.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.305
Can we get a bottle of soju and coke?

00:49:58.305 --> 00:50:00.005
You've had enough!

00:50:00.005 --> 00:50:01.468
Please just get us some Sprite.

00:50:01.468 --> 00:50:05.692
Detective Kang... ran away, huh?

00:50:05.692 --> 00:50:09.730
He ran away because he's scared.

00:50:10.488 --> 00:50:14.153
I slept two hours a day

00:50:14.153 --> 00:50:18.025
to barely pass the police exam

00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:19.269
and finally joined the force.

00:50:19.269 --> 00:50:21.410
Hey, you're drunk. That's enough.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:25.571
After I joined, I looked at Detective Kang

00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:31.236
and thought to myself that all that studying was worth it.

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:34.806
I told myself it was good that I decided to become a cop.

00:50:34.806 --> 00:50:37.260
My dream was to...

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:43.791
become a remarkable detective like him!

00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:45.091
Damn it!

00:50:45.091 --> 00:50:46.843
Hey, hey, hey.

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.541
- Sorry, sir.
- My dream

00:50:48.541 --> 00:50:49.720
- Hey, hey!
- won't come true.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.801
What kind of violent crimes detective cries!

00:50:52.801 --> 00:50:54.917
It's because things feel so hopeless!

00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:56.573
I don't want to end up like that.

00:50:56.573 --> 00:50:59.133
He's losing it.

00:50:59.133 --> 00:51:00.332
- Hey.
- Come on.

00:51:00.332 --> 00:51:01.412
Get a hold of yourself!

00:51:01.412 --> 00:51:03.203
Can we get a cola, please?

00:51:03.203 --> 00:51:04.955
That's enough!

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.958
Let's end it here for today. Everyone, get up.

00:51:09.994 --> 00:51:11.097
I apologize, sir.

00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:12.950
It's on me, sir.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.160
Stop speaking nonsense.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.379
- Hey, Detective Oh.
- I have money.

00:51:18.517 --> 00:51:20.517
Are you sure it's Park Geon Ho?

00:51:29.676 --> 00:51:33.519
Do you see the wound on his left thigh?

00:51:34.577 --> 00:51:35.672
It's a stab wound.

00:51:35.672 --> 00:51:37.862
So it was a murder.

00:51:38.788 --> 00:51:40.488
Do you...

00:51:41.526 --> 00:51:43.210
know who did it?

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.501
The real killer.

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:45.860
What?

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.781
The real killer in Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:51:48.781 --> 00:51:51.045
Stop joking around.

00:51:51.045 --> 00:51:53.255
What does that case have to do with this?

00:51:53.255 --> 00:51:57.379
Do you think I would joke around in front of a dead body?

00:52:08.068 --> 00:52:11.287
If you had told us earlier what Park Geon Ho had told you,

00:52:11.287 --> 00:52:13.905
we would've tailed him.

00:52:16.323 --> 00:52:18.411
And Park Geon Ho wouldn't have died?

00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:20.357
Are you saying he died because of me?

00:52:20.357 --> 00:52:21.557
No.

00:52:21.557 --> 00:52:24.270
We would've been able to catch the killer.

00:52:25.945 --> 00:52:31.545
The only one who is responsible for someone's death is the one who killed them.

00:52:32.203 --> 00:52:34.670
It's no one else's fault besides the killer's.

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.930
What is this?

00:52:45.431 --> 00:52:47.187
How did they find out about this?

00:52:47.187 --> 00:52:50.754
I had to report it to the chief. It's a murder case.

00:52:50.754 --> 00:52:52.673
Damn it!

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.740
Shit.

00:53:01.793 --> 00:53:05.329
I'm sorry but this is our case.

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:07.564
You can stay out of it. Chief's orders.

00:53:07.564 --> 00:53:10.579
Come on, that's not right.

00:53:10.579 --> 00:53:14.130
- We're the ones who found the body. What the hell are you talking about?
- Hey, stop it.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:14.997
What did you just say?

00:53:14.997 --> 00:53:18.022
This is pissing me off.

00:53:18.022 --> 00:53:23.520
You're the head of division 1, not us. Don't order us around.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.266
Let's make that clear.

00:53:26.266 --> 00:53:29.414
Just do as I say and stay out of it.

00:53:30.669 --> 00:53:32.532
What if I don't?

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.384
- I said stay out of it.
- Stay back.

00:53:36.257 --> 00:53:37.957
- He smells of alcohol.
- What?

00:53:38.545 --> 00:53:41.145
You crazy bastard.

00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:46.296
Why did you hit him?

00:53:46.296 --> 00:53:47.852
Have you guys lost your minds?

00:53:47.852 --> 00:53:50.676
You came to a murder scene drunk?

00:53:51.413 --> 00:53:53.400
We drank because of you!

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.153
Get out right now!

00:53:55.153 --> 00:53:57.508
That's not what we're talking about.

00:53:57.508 --> 00:53:58.509
Get out!

00:53:58.509 --> 00:53:59.478
Get out!

00:53:59.478 --> 00:54:00.430
That bastard...

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.173
Hyeong.

00:54:02.711 --> 00:54:03.799
You need to go on your vacation.

00:54:03.799 --> 00:54:06.762
That piece of...

00:54:06.762 --> 00:54:07.906
Get out.

00:54:07.906 --> 00:54:09.517
I said get out.

00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:11.541
Yeah.

00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:13.301
I need to go on my vacation.

00:54:13.301 --> 00:54:15.000
Make sure you tape off the scene!

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.186
Don't let anyone other than my team in without my order.

00:54:19.186 --> 00:54:22.060
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.000
Reporter Jin.

00:54:47.426 --> 00:54:49.210
Reporter Jin, what are you going to do now?

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.844
To be honest, this is overwhelming.

00:54:51.844 --> 00:54:55.110
And I feel like this isn't something I should handle.

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:59.492
It's because I'm hungry. I'll feel better once I eat.

00:54:59.492 --> 00:55:01.751
What are you going to do, Detective Kang?

00:55:01.751 --> 00:55:03.593
I've got to catch the killer.

00:55:03.593 --> 00:55:05.522
That's my job.

00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:07.917
What about you, Detective Oh?

00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:11.075
I can just drop you off in front of the café, right?

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:14.431
Yes. Thank you so much.

00:55:18.966 --> 00:55:20.366
Yes.

00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:22.611
Oh.

00:55:24.202 --> 00:55:25.202
Got it.

00:55:25.202 --> 00:55:26.814
Bye.

00:55:27.834 --> 00:55:29.730
The phone is still here.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:31.394
So they haven't collected the phone yet.

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:34.785
- You said it was ringing earlier, right?
- Yes.

00:55:35.433 --> 00:55:40.066
I'm sure Park Geon Ho hid his phone without the killer knowing.

00:55:40.066 --> 00:55:44.499
When he called Reporter Jin, he already knew that he was in danger.

00:55:44.499 --> 00:55:47.764
Most people would've asked for help,

00:55:47.764 --> 00:55:51.027
but Park Geon Ho said he would send a picture first.

00:55:51.027 --> 00:55:56.830
It was more important for him to reveal who the killer was than to save his own life.

00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:05.470
Why did he sacrifice his own life to reveal Lee Dae Cheol's innocence?

00:56:38.198 --> 00:56:40.231
Which floor is this?

00:56:40.231 --> 00:56:41.546
Fifth floor.

00:56:41.546 --> 00:56:44.338
How many more floors are left?

00:56:44.338 --> 00:56:45.817
The building has 15 floors.

00:56:45.817 --> 00:56:48.217
Damn it.

00:56:48.217 --> 00:56:52.827
The people below will see us if we turn on the flashlight, right?

00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:56.274
Let's just wait here until the sun comes up.

00:56:57.127 --> 00:56:58.651
Sit comfortably.

00:56:58.651 --> 00:57:00.270
This is comfortable.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.829
Lean your back on the wall.

00:57:09.373 --> 00:57:11.340
What time is it?

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.868
Three.

00:57:12.868 --> 00:57:15.442
Aigoo, we have a long way to go.

00:57:15.442 --> 00:57:17.586
Why did you take a break from work?

00:57:17.586 --> 00:57:19.244
Did you get tired of the detective work?

00:57:19.244 --> 00:57:22.155
I thought you said it suits you.

00:57:22.155 --> 00:57:23.516
I got some money.

00:57:23.516 --> 00:57:25.068
What?

00:57:25.068 --> 00:57:27.824
Did you win the lottery or something?

00:57:27.824 --> 00:57:30.827
- I got an inheritance.
- How much?

00:57:30.827 --> 00:57:34.503
A lot more than I would get from winning the lottery.

00:57:34.503 --> 00:57:35.998
No wonder.

00:57:35.998 --> 00:57:39.950
I knew you had something to fall back on.

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.063
Then why are you working?

00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:46.328
I would just travel for the rest of my life and enjoy life.

00:57:46.328 --> 00:57:48.030
You have family, right?

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.442
Of course.

00:57:49.442 --> 00:57:52.285
No one who gives me money.

00:57:52.285 --> 00:57:57.421
Just little baby birds who suck me dry.

00:57:57.421 --> 00:57:59.973
I don't have any family.

00:58:00.938 --> 00:58:04.138
When I got rid of the detective title,

00:58:05.425 --> 00:58:08.358
all I had left was money, and I was gone.

00:58:10.372 --> 00:58:13.652
Give me a damn break.

00:58:14.433 --> 00:58:16.766
I can't talk to you.

00:58:17.943 --> 00:58:20.210
What time is it?

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.745
3:02am.

00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:24.322
It's only been two minutes?

00:59:09.398 --> 00:59:13.080
Send these to the investigation team and go explain to them what the scene was like.

00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:15.630
Tell them he probably got stabbed by a nail because it was a

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.991
construction site. Or they'll end up assuming the wrong thing.

00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:19.215
Yes, sir.

00:59:19.215 --> 00:59:21.012
Did you find any other belongings?

00:59:21.012 --> 00:59:24.794
We don't have his phone.

00:59:26.928 --> 00:59:28.526
That's no big deal.

00:59:28.526 --> 00:59:30.291
No need to worry about it.

00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:33.928
But I looked into where he made his last call, just to make sure.

00:59:33.928 --> 00:59:36.245
And it was near the scene of the crime.

00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:39.117
Someone else had requested the information before I did.

00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:40.018
Who?

00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:42.640
The new detective, Oh Ji Hyeok, from Team 2.

00:59:54.779 --> 00:59:56.379
Hyeongnim!

01:01:08.774 --> 01:01:12.397
Oh Ji Hyeok, this bastard hasn't been answering all day long.

01:01:12.397 --> 01:01:14.164
Were there any suspicious people around?

01:01:14.164 --> 01:01:16.736
No, sir.

01:01:36.577 --> 01:01:37.978
There's nothing here.

01:01:38.002 --> 01:01:38.927
Go up more.

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:40.627
Yes, sir.

01:02:47.859 --> 01:02:50.605
The district attorney wants to see me again?

01:02:50.629 --> 01:02:51.929
Why?

01:02:51.929 --> 01:02:53.926
I don't know.

01:02:53.926 --> 01:02:56.631
You should ask him yourself.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.774
[The Good Detective]

01:03:36.774 --> 01:03:39.442
~ Preview ~
Your dad is going to be executed soon.

01:03:39.442 --> 01:03:40.739
You're going to look into it?

01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:44.372
I don't know why that keeps bothering me.

01:03:44.372 --> 01:03:45.430
You bastard!

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:49.208
I didn't kill anyone! I didn't kill them! I had no reason to do that!

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:51.524
I came to see the boss. Joo Seong Dae is inside, right?

01:03:51.548 --> 01:03:54.283
Kill him!

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.161
I'm with the man from the picture right now.

01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:00.592
Help me, please.

01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:05.812
Park Geon Ho wanted to tell us something. He wanted us to start over from here.

01:04:05.812 --> 01:04:08.277
Once I start, I never let go.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.930
Until the other person gets locked up.
