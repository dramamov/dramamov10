[Episode 8]

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.440
Look, he's in pain. Did you give him enough anesthesia?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.860
I applied local anesthesia.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.660
Hey! Quit being a baby. He used anesthetics.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.040
I got stabbed with a knife. How would it not hurt?

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.180
Enough anesthetic went in. The pain will subside.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090
It really hurts!

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
How can I say it? It's like my large intestines are being twisted.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.540
Do you need to poop?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.280
Maybe?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240
It feels like it could be.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.220
Hey, Ji Man Goo, are you okay?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.790
It hurts a little, but I'm okay.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.850
- Is he really okay?
- Luckily, he doesn't have any internal damage.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.350
He's just lost a lot of blood. I think he'll be fine once the wound is stitched up.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.850
That's good.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.990
Ji Woong, what about Ji Woong?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.470
He got hit in the face, so it's a bit swollen, but...

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.580
We think patient Byeon Ji Woong needs to go into surgery.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.240
The MRI photo results came out, and there's cerebral hemorrhaging.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.430
What?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.790
What?

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.880
Man Goo? What happened to Man Goo?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.280
Man Goo is fine. Really.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.600
That happened because of me.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.460
He said, don't go.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.440
Man Goo. I'm worried about Man Goo.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.420
Man Goo is fine, so just take care of yourself first.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.770
Man Goo. Man Goo.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.690
Man Goo.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.350
You can't die, Man Goo.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.340
You have to live.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.970
You must live, Man Goo.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.040
Man Goo.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.230
You have to live, Man Goo.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.250
You can't die, Man Goo.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100
Man Goo.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.070
Bovie.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.990
Micro size, please.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450
Scalpel.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.040
Timing and Subtitles by the
⚖️🕵🏻‍♂️ The Incheon Case Crackers 🕵🏻‍♂️⚖️ @Viki.com

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.770
Are you having fun?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.140
Do we look easier than the West Incheon guys?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.180
Let's cut the chit-chat

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.020
and start focusing on the important cases.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.950
Did you kill Jo Sang Pil?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.710
No.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.670
Won't it just tire us both out if we go into additional investigations?

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.740
The big boss

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.060
was killed by the Rotary Gang.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.730
Should I just hand you over to Incheon?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.090
They'll be all over this.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.320
Should I just let you go?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.520
The East Gangnam guys will be excited to come running over with a knife.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.000
Team Leader,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.250
- a lawyer is here.
- I'm Choi Sang Ho.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.730
The client and I have some things to discuss, so would you kindly give us the room?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.210
[Choi Sang Ho]

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.020
Charges of organized crime

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.540
and assault and injury due to inter-organizational violence.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.150
Three years? Maybe,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.660
four years.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.710
I mean,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.470
why are you protecting that scumbag?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.050
He did some work for TJ for a while.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.980
What exactly? Something with more than a 3-4 year sentence?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.340
It's related to someone higher than me in my group.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.250
If it gets out, it'll create trouble for me.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.500
This related business,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.420
is it a serious crime like murder, or something worse?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.200
Not that far.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.100
Okay.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.590
I'll investigate, for now. However,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.310
if it's something more serious than what I'm thinking of,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.770
I have no choice but to be a dutiful police officer.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.990
Please understand that.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.790
What's the reason?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.570
It was an inevitable choice that was made for our family.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.810
What did Tae Ho do?

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.560
The McQueen headquarters chose Tae Ho as future CEO.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.060
It's just their decision.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.510
Team Leader Woo was planning to get Sang Woo arrested.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.440
McQueen Korea's chairman is my college friend.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.140
Through him,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.810
I found out that Tae Ho had a backdoor deal with McQueen.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.270
So?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.830
You're telling me that you and Tae Ho have no relation? Is that it?

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.230
You said it yourself, Chairman.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.610
The next supreme leader of TJ will be my brother.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.100
If he gets arrested, there's no future for TJ.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.720
TJ's future

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.000
is my future.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.270
For my future,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.980
I decided to divorce him. That's all.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.410
Could Tae Ho alone

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.400
have drawn such a big picture without you?

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.330
I still love him.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.300
For just a moment,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.760
I had to follow his lead.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.310
I'm sorry.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.030
I'm really sorry.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.480
I'm hurting.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.210
It was a very painful choice.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.450
But because of him,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.130
I didn't want to lose you and my brother.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.150
That guy

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.560
knows all of our dirt from the very bottom.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.040
Just because we cut him off

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.480
doesn't mean he's going to let this go easily.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.470
That's why I had to let him go.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.440
Because without me,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.370
he is nothing.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.300
It was an inevitable choice.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.430
We need to make you their target

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.680
to direct their focus away from us.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.910
Shouldn't you have discussed this with me at least once?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.720
It's just an interview on air that has no legal power.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.990
It can be taken back at any moment.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.230
Are you saying the pain you cause me doesn't matter at all?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.700
Are you so proud?

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.040
What?

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.700
I called the reporters. You'll do an interview on your own.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.750
Be sure to make yourself look like selfish garbage.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.870
That'll clear their doubts about you and me.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.260
Why should I do that?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.700
Because I will never leave you.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.900
Maybe you won't.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.520
Didn't it ever occur to you that I could leave you?

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.980
That's a no,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.200
because that would mean I lost to that lowly girl.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.080
Please don't do that.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.340
We are not

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.820
legally divorced yet.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.110
It is my fault.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.800
However, it's not a reason for divorce.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.080
I'll do my best

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.360
to reach an amicable agreement.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.150
What will happen if you can't come to an agreement?

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.360
That's difficult to answer right now.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.920
Are you going to go to court?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.810
That's hard to answer as well.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.700
However,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.400
the issue of responsibility for this unilateral divorce notice,
[TJ's Cheon Na Na's husband, Woo Tae Ho, refuses divorce]

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.290
and my legitimate rights will be addressed conscientiously.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.020
I'm sorry, this is all I have to say.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.270
Does that mean that you're publicly refusing the divorce?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.520
What about the settlement problem─

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.550
Dumping her husband too?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.020
Na Na, you...

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.770
But Woo Tae Ho

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.550
isn't acting like Woo Tae Ho.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.520
We removed the blood from the side that was hemorrhaged. The pressure in his brain has stabilized.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.810
We'll need to wait and see the results of the surgery, but the surgery itself went well.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.800
Doctor, could there be any aftereffects from the surgery?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.210
I can't tell you for sure. Because brain surgery, no matter how minor it is, could nudge a nerve.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.970
The anesthesia will wear off soon.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.750
If he says he feels pain, please contact the nurse's station.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.240
Okay, thank you.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.920
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.520
Yes. Thank you.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.540
He'll be fine, right?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.330
He didn't have any problems when he rolled around and got beaten up at crime scenes before.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.380
He won't have any complications.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.140
Maybe not physically, but he could have lingering psychological problems.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.590
That's true.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:05.050
Ji Woong Hyeong. He might look like a bandit, but he is surprisingly mentally weak.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.640
He was probably psychologically traumatized.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.730
Hey, how could a detective get traumatized by something like this?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.470
His brain is so simple, so there's no way.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.580
Even if the brain is simple, there can still be trauma.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.560
Why are you looking at me as you say that?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.060
Just...

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.030
Man Goo.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.940
Ji Woong, are you awake? Does it hurt anywhere?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.520
What happened to Man Goo?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.220
M-Man Goo?

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.170
Man Goo is fine. As good as new.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.140
You're lying, aren't you?

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.020
You're lying to reassure me, aren't you?

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.800
Man Goo's dead.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.450
Man Goo's dead!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.240
What do you mean Man Goo is dead?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.580
He bled a bit, so he got some stitches, and now he's fine!

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.540
Stop lying to me!

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.280
Man Goo's dead!

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.940
Man Goo!

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.680
Man Goo!

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.010
Hyeong!

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.390
I'm fine.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.880
Man Goo!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.480
You're not a ghost, right?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.270
It's not just m-m-me that can see him right now, right?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.720
I mean, I'm the one that got stabbed with a knife. Why are you over there like that?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.340
Come here.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.140
Come here, please! Hurry.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.970
Hyeong.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.390
You're Man Goo, right? You're not a ghost?

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.770
What do you mean ghost? I'm breathing. See?

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:55.020
I'm sorry. It's all my fault!

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.410
I'm so sorry, Man Goo!

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:03.680
Why is this your fault when your injuries are worse?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.900
You're severely injured because I got stabbed and fell.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.870
- It's all my fault.
- No.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.570
I'm sorry. I was so stupid.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.640
From now on, I'll do everything you ask me to.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.680
I'll follow you if you want me to, and I'll stay if you tell me to stay.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.320
I'm sorry!

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.660
Why do you keep doing this?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.700
You're the one with a hole in your head!

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.940
You're hurt worse than I am. Why do you keep apologizing?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.660
Stop.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.030
Thank you for surviving, Man Goo.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.800
Should we be crying with them?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:59.120
It's a bit touching. One got stabbed and one had a head injury, but why is it funny to me?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.550
This is the true friendship of detectives. It's not funny.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.940
- Man Goo.
- Yeah?

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:14.260
Don't get hurt. If you're hurt, I'll be hurt more.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.380
Hyeong,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.520
don't be in pain by yourself.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.330
Let's be in pain together.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.360
This is driving me nuts.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.470
- What should we do?
- Aigoo.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.920
Looks like he has psychological side effects.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.660
That bastard Gi Dong Jae needs to be arrested by us!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.410
Why do we have to hand him to the Seoul MIU after he did that to our boys?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.010
They're the ones who cuffed him. We have no right to take him.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.440
They stole him away on purpose so that we can't investigate.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.000
At least he was caught.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.480
Once they are done, we can bring him over!

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.130
They won't give him to us. Gi Dong Jae will refuse too.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.640
The prosecution won't take the additional indictment, either.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.950
I don't know about all that law crap, but I will get him even if I have to use force.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.160
I won't leave that asshole alone.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.020
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.950
You've already dealt with Team Leader Jang Gi Jin.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.010
Do you think he would listen just because we make a fuss?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:21.040
It's embarrassing! Our guys got stabbed, and one even needed brain surgery.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.030
Team Leader Woo is right.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.500
That bastard Jang Gi Jin won't even look our way, no matter how much we beg.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.500
We know him better than you guys, so we'll try to persuade him.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.670
You guys stay at the side of the injured guys.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.410
Hey. Be reasonable. Don't get emotional. That'll just make things worse.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.580
Of course, obviously.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.120
Those damn bastards!

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.240
How dare they?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.040
How dare they even touch my guys?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.500
They're all dead!

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.710
Gi Dong Jae! Gi Dong Jae! Gi Dong Jae!

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.570
They're all dead! I'm going to avenge them!

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.000
Gi Dong Jae! I'll make sure you never escape!

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.950
How dare they!

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.630
I'm going to put a hole in his head,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.360
and leave a stab wound in his stomach!

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.260
He'll never take his cuffs off!

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.500
All right, I'm good. Let's go.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.270
Yes, sir.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.490
I'm going to give it back to him.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.060
You should've been more careful.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.560
Why'd you break everything?

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.320
I'm gonna put a hole in his head and leave a stab wound in his stomach.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.100
Why did you guys

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.870
arrest Gi Dong Jae?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.590
If your allegations are the same as ours. We're willing to let you take care of Gi Dong Jae.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.620
You go first. Why were you chasing him?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.970
You don't have allegations, do you? You just caught him anyway, right?

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.790
I am showing extreme restraint right now. Before I explode, explain it so that I can understand.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.760
What are you doing?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.480
Don't you remember what you said before?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.380
"Even dogs don't bark at someone else's yard without permission."

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.990
It's because of Jeong Hui Joo's murder case.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.630
Do you know that we're in charge of that case?

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.830
You must've found something. Hand it over to us, and we'll investigate things further.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.910
That's a bit difficult because your reason for arresting Gi Dong Jae is a bit fishy.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.130
That bastard Gi Dong Jae has a past record.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.010
He got out of an allegation just by having Team Leader Choi Yong Geun on his side.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.270
Both cases are very similar.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.370
Aren't you close friends with former team leader Choi Yong Guen as his hoobae?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.080
I can't give you an answer because we're in the initial stages of the investigation.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.210
We'll see how it progresses, and if we need your input, we'll contact you.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.950
Two of our detectives are in the hospital because they got hurt.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Gi Dong Jae stabbed and beat them up like they were dogs.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.230
Those two are my colleagues,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.140
but they're also

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.410
your police colleagues.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.360
Let's focus on Gi Dong Jae.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.720
Our only way is to find evidence and get the prosecutor to bring more charges against him.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.560
There's a former prosecutor and chaebol's son-in-law behind this case.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.930
- Do you think that'll work?
- When have we ever looked behind while running forward?

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.970
If there's a wall, we can climb over it, and if it's too high, we can smash through it.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.960
You've grown out of your puberty stage. Now you just need to get over this midlife crisis.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.610
I'm not in a midlife crisis. I'm not even married. How could I be?

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.070
There are some cases like that.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.280
Cases where they don't get married and still go through a midlife crisis. It's the worst.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.260
No matter how much you make fun of me, I feel comforted when I see you.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.240
The present me is the future you.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.970
I know. You'll experience the same worst moment, just as I did.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.960
Why are you saying such a terrible thing?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.750
Wait for me, future Kang Do Chang. Do Chang!

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.650
- I hate it.
- Do Chang!

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.180
Do Chang!

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.850
The Incheon West Station guys were here.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.490
They're chasing you for murder.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:52.300
I told you that I didn't kill Sang Pil Hyeongnim.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.480
Not that, but the Jeong Hui Joo murder.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.380
Why are they accusing me of that?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.270
How am I connected to that woman?

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.460
What do you mean? You're connected to TJ.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.990
And your lawyer is also part of the TJ legal advisory team.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.450
I don't know. Talk with my lawyer.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.900
I won't talk anymore. I don't have anything else to say anyway.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.610
I see.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.100
You don't want to deal with someone so lowly as me?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.020
Who's behind you?

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.490
Where are you getting this confidence from?

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.540
Do you think that you can freely stab and beat the heads of detectives,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.520
and the person behind you will take care of it?

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.140
Does the world look so easy to you?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.450
Team Leader,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.570
don't make it complicated.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.260
I said I admit to organized crime.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.320
You just need to do as the lawyer says and─

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.760
Hey, get up! Hey!

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.910
Stand straight.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.450
Team Leader,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.990
this isn't right.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.310
What? Do you think it's unfair?

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.220
Okay. Then,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.100
here.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.790
You can

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.370
hit me, too.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.650
I'm a detective. Just like the guys you attacked.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.700
Hit me without any concerns, you bastard!

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.230
Why don't you stop? If you keep on going, I don't think this will be good for you.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.410
I know. But what can I do?

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.610
I'm too embarrassed.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.910
If I

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.950
leave a guy like you who treats detectives like dog shit,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.480
I wouldn't be able to live with myself because I'll be too embarrassed.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.110
Do you know what day and age it is?

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.480
How dare a detective physically harm a suspect!? Are you out of your mind!?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.990
That bastard went as far as stabbing detectives.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.050
One of them had to have surgery for a brain hemorrhage.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.430
None of them are us.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.200
I heard it was the West Incheon detectives! Why are you standing up for them?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.960
Whoever it is, they're also our police colleagues.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.210
So? It's revenge for your colleagues?

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.990
That's what thugs do. You're a police officer!

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.140
If you're a police officer, you should've taken care of it like a police officer!

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.370
What do you think is the reason I've been risking my life to survive in an environment like this?

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.840
It's because of the belief that my colleague, who eats the same meals here as I do

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.170
will protect me if something happens to me.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.240
If we let someone like Gi Dong Jae go without any retribution,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.650
would they...

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.290
Would they be able to trust me

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.620
and risk their lives and go into crime scenes?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.600
Gi Dong Jae's lawyer

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.710
will sue you for assault.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.710
I'll go to trial.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.430
Hand over Gi Dong Jae to another team, and you go back home and stay there.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.570
What are you doing?

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.770
Did you not tell your wife yet?

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.440
Hyeongnim,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.220
thank you for your kindness,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.550
but I don't think this is a place for me to live.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.720
It doesn't suit me.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.980
Hey,

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.970
I already took care of the lawyer too. Everything will go by without any trouble.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.620
No.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.160
I'll just take a break.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.050
I'm sick of it.

Can't you get rid of your overzealous personality?

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.160
It only works when you're young and healthy.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.740
Hey, your child is already...

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.170
Think of your child and push it down and live.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.520
The MIU Chief will hand over Gi Dong Jae to another team.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.970
I'm sorry I wasn't any help.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.780
I was hoping you would continue to be in charge of that case.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.140
That's going to be difficult.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.960
It's gotten really complicated.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.940
It doesn't look like the chief will let things slide.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.540
I want to keep you around.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.080
Hyeongnim, let's just

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.290
end it here.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.440
If we keep going, things will get awkward between us.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.470

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.380
Team Leader, the transfers were decided this morning.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.060
Already? Where to?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.390
I want to go somewhere far away where the air is clean.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.540
Not yours. It's the chief of the MIU.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:25.600
If I had known this was how things would be, I would've been better to you.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.020
You're the winner.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.920
Welcome, welcome.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.950
Come in, come in.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.730
Is this

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.090
something that can be leaked?

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.650
Isn't this the data from the police side?

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.950
Someone took it out and sent it to Gi Dong Jae.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.400
Gi Dong Jae saw the photos and manipulated them to look like a serial murder.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.510
That means someone from the police side is connected.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.060
There's a good chance it came from the Seoul MIU, who were responsible for the case.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.620
Are you certain that this came from Gi Dong Jae's computer?

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.870
Yes. It was on the computer in the factory where Gi Dong Jae was hiding.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.770
Okay. I think this is enough

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.480
for the prosecutor to allow additional charges. Do you think it's possible?

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.220
Something's missing.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.320
We're missing our big finisher.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.310
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.440
This is the last place that recorded what happened. Nothing else was captured.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.040
Have you checked the car?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.140
It's a stolen car.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.260
What about the camera on the other side?

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.120
It's not on there.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.110
They brought Jeong Hui Joo to the mountain and dumped her

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.210
and disappeared with the car.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.930
Hey, Ji Hyeok!

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.720
Hey.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.490
Seems possible.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.210
Jae Hong,

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.100
do you think it's possible to collect DNA?

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.820
It was in the water too long, so I think it'll be difficult to get any blood.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.150
Even hair might be hard to get because it probably drifted away.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.530
Hyeongnim!

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.870
- What is it?
- This.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.520
- Where did you find that?
- It's a lipstick cap.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.220
I found it wedged under the driver's seat.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.960
After going through such difficulties, we were able to obtain incriminating evidence.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.150
- You're saying that the lipstick cap was found in the car, right?
- Yes.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.550
Did the forensic results come in?

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.120
Yes. They said it was the same lipstick brand as the one used in Ms. Jeong's case.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.360
Then, that kind of puts the story together.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.770
Arrest Gi Dong Jae and interrogate him.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.360
The MIU has him, so we can't bring him right now.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.570
We have to give the evidence to the prosecution, get additional charges added,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.800
and get a separate arrest warrant, first.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.030
Did you find the motive for the murder?

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.820
It's not a solo crime by Gi Dong Jae. Somebody ordered him to do it.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.340
The motive will be revealed when we catch the person who gave the order.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.020
Who is it?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.860
I asked, who is it?

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.920
Either Woo Tae Ho, or Cheon Sang Woo, one of the two.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.260
The individuals I know, you know, and the entire world knows.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.300
That Woo Tae Ho and Cheon Sang Woo?

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.020
Are you going to send the person behind this to the prosecutor?

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.260
We should.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.850
You know that the prosecution doesn't allow additional charges that easily.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.240
It's hard, even if we send everything.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.660
Is there evidence that they're the people that orchestrated this?

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.670
I'll show you. If you see it, you'll understand.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.150

No, no, no, no, that's okay. It's okay.

I said it's fine.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.940
Hey, I'm sick of saying the same thing to you all the time,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.020
but are you doing this even with the knowledge of who they are?

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.060
We know them very well. They're big fish.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.980
My wife's younger sister's husband

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.240

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.080
If this goes south, my wife will kill me.

Rather than law and principles, capturing criminals is first and foremost for him.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.040
Is that so?

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.530
He's probably hard to tame. Okay.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.830
I'll take care of it on my own, so just pretend that you didn't hear anything from me.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.060
Okay.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.630
You can go.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.200
Yes.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.670
Right.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.600
I'm sorry, but why did you and Team Leader Woo Tae Ho...?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.260
I'm sorry. I should've told you earlier.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.880
However, that won't affect our goals.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.750
Then, will the team leader be leaving his position?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:37.670
Not yet. But he'll have to go someday.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.330
He has become a normal person who has nothing to do with TJ.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.600
Okay. I understand.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.620
I've shut the mouth of Gi Dong Jae for sure. You don't have to worry about him.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.540
You know it, right?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.840
If things go wrong, I won't be the only one falling into a shithole.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.740
Yes, I know that.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.590
Also, make sure that everyone close to this is kept quiet.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:18.040
Honestly, I'm more worried about the people on our side than the police.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.010
I'll make sure that doesn't happen. Don't worry about it.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.000
You're still here.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.500
Yes. I had something to get from Deputy Park, but it looks like he went home.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.060
Yes.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.680
Aren't you going home?

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.360
I should.

Yes.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.270
Wasn't the 6th floor of the basement designated for people that are directors and higher?

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:11.380
There wasn't any parking above it. I'll be careful from now on.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.490
I forgot I was meeting someone for drinks.

I'll need to meet with Gi Dong Jae soon.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:29.800
Last time, I think I said something I shouldn't have said to you.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.490
I don't think that counts as a reason to resign.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:37.790
I don't care about Dad's work, but I guess I'm his daughter.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.470
I keep thinking of Ms. Jeong Hui Joo's case.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:48.900
The police force that my dad is in, the company where you're at, it doesn't help either of those.

You keep thinking of Ms. Jeong Hui Joo's case?

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.270
It has nothing to do with company work.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.070
That case will be solved soon.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.650

[If you have a dream, you can start over]

I'm excited.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.400
I feel like I'm on a blind date, like back in college.

I'm Cheon Na Na.

You don't have to introduce yourself.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.690
Everyone knows who you are.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.800
I'm sorry, but I'm not here for a blind date.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.230
I can be the only one that's excited.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.410
What brings you here?

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.300
These days, I'm interested in someone called Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.120
You're his cousin, am I right?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.660
Oh Ji Hyeok, what a guy.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.050
He must be snooping around a billionaire's daughter now.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.820
The two of you don't have a good relationship, do you?

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.530
He's the one who shoved me into this place.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.510
There's no reason for me to like him.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.220
I'll hurt him in your place.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.130
Tell me where it hurts for him.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.990

I'm sorry, that's not it.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.670
Then it's no use.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.270
He doesn't get hurt easily, no matter where you nudge him.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:10.020
I stabbed him with a knife once,

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.670
but he didn't make a peep.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.130
He's a terrible little bastard.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.550

I'm satisfied with just meeting you in person today.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.770
Are you

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.870
confident that you can hurt him so much that he would want to die?

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:36.620
[If you have a dream, you can start over]

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.970
He strangled me first.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.110
I can't leave him be.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.890
Ji Hyeok,

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.490
dig deep inside of him.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.810
You'll see someone.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.030
His mom.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.690
She died because of her pathetic child.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.650
Ji Hyeok's mom.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.460
I didn't come to check on you recently, did I?

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.930
I was very busy. I'm sorry.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.880
I'm always grateful to you.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.960
Ms. Jeong Hui Joo spoke about you sometimes.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.550
That you're having a hard time because of your child.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.990
But she had nothing she could do to help,

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.090
so she felt sorry.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.290
Your hair on top is not quite settling.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:31.590
Should I cut it for you?

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.640
Did Ms. Jeong Hui Joo try to help you?

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.940
That's why she showed you the documents.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.190
I'll help you in her stead.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.200
I'll return the child to her mother's arms.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.730
Is that

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:49.480
even possible?

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.040
As long as we stop Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo from butting in, it's definitely possible.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.540
That man

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.420
has no right to be a father to a child.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.490
What

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.060
do you need?

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.160
You, Ms. Jeong Hui Joo, and Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.660
You just need to tell me what only the three of you know.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.390
Show this to Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:59.610
If he doesn't return your child, tell him you're going to publicize this.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:00.870
Hui Joo.

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.660
If I think about what you went through,

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:06.280
I want to take it to the police right away, so he'll get punished.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.040
But your child comes first.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.640
No.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.980
You're doing this because you don't know how scary that person is.

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.130
I can't do this.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.580
He won't leave me alone.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.080
I can't do it.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.780
I'm scared.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.010
Tell him I have it.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:33.150
That if something happens to you, I will go running to the police right away.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.020
If you do that, you and your child will both be safe.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.430
Hui Joo.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.950
I want to meet Soo Yeon, too.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.980
I bet she's very pretty because she takes after you.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.820
Hui Joo.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.800
I'm sorry.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.040
I'm sorry.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:14.700
Is this your father?

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.320
He has a kind face.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.810
I've been burying him in my heart too much.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.730
I decided to bring him out and keep him by my side.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.220
Yes. Your father would like that too.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.920
Hui Joo Eonni is such a pretty person.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.720
Yeah.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.600
She had pretty eyes.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.800
When I looked into her eyes, it made me feel peaceful.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.980
You drew it so well,

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.850
so it looks like he's smiling at you.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:49.420
Yes. He smiled whenever he saw me.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.040
Aren't you going to drink?

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.790
I'm sorry.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.850
I have to go back to the station.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.820
What a shame.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.730
What did you want to say?

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.700
You and I

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:36.730
seem very similar, don't you think?

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.350
You look like you have sadness in your eyes.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.280
I think you were as sad as I was.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.010
My mom died,

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.610
because of me.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.800
It flutters in my eyes all the time.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.990
I can't forget it.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.400
That face that looked at me

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.810
before she died.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.760
It was a face of resentment towards me.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.260
"I'm dying because of you."

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.180
Why are you

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.200
telling me this?

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.070
I told you.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.030
I saw my sadness in your eyes.

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:25.740
Did you

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:31.570
find out something about me?

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:37.980
I'm just talking about myself. I know nothing about you.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.290
