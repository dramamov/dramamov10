(The 33rd Miss Korea Pre-show)

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.300
What's this? Why isn't she leaving?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.170
- What are you doing? - What's wrong with her?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.650
Jong Hee.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.180
- Jong Hee. - What's going on?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.520
- Jong Hee! - What's wrong with her?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.020
Jong Hee, snap out of it.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.120
Jong Hee!

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.390
An ambulance! Someone call an ambulance, quick!

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.030
Hurry!

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.360
Jong Hee. What do I do?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.370
Back then, I had no idea.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.940
That the series of misfortunes that had befallen us...

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.710
was only just the beginning.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.440
And...

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.410
Just as it had been with Jong Hee,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.720
that those who leave always come back...

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.190
to the crossroads where our separate lives would meet.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.760
To the place our cruel fate was leading us.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.100
(Episode 12: The Unfinished Story)

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.660
Jong Hee, are you okay? Hey.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.930
Are you with me?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.510
It was him.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910
Him? Who are you talking about?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.910
The personnel manager.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.350
I'm sure it was him.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.690
He was staring at me like he wanted to kill me.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.260
The personnel manager?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.360
He went to see Mom.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.060
With my brother.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.340
Claiming I tried to kill him.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.310
If she didn't give him money, he'd go to the press.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.680
But why would he show up there?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.950
Because he knows he can't get anything out of my mom...

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.150
So he came to threaten me?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.380
That must be it, right?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.890
That's why he came for me, right? Tell me I'm right.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.920
Jong Hee, I need you to calm down.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.990
Here.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.690
- Have some water... - But I'm telling you, I saw him!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.790
So you're sure... it was definitely him?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.590
The personnel manager, or whatever his name is.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.130
He was glaring at me like he wanted to kill me.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.060
Like it was some kind of warning.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.230
What on earth is he planning?

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.200
Why would he show up there?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.670
That's enough. I don't want you to worry about this.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.980
I'll take care of everything.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.550
You just focus on the pageant.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.350
Whatever that scumbag has planned, I'll make sure it comes to nothing.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.860
In return, the star of the pageant must be...

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.300
my daughter, Seo Jong Hee.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.460
Understand?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.040
Hey, hold on.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.180
What is it? Who are you?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.410
What happened?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.910
"Miss Korea contestant Seo Jong Hee..."

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.880
"tried to commit murder in the past and now lives under a new identity."

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.850
You said a story this big would make the front page.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.150
But now there's nothing but radio silence.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.160
You think pushing a pen makes you a reporter?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.360
Look...

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.330
Sorry, but that's...

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.500
not something you should be taking up with me.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.830
Turns out there's something mightier than the pen.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.540
It's the money that makes the world go around.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.540
If you've got a problem with that, go become a chairman yourself.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.180
Me? I just do what my editor tells me to do.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.620
Make it look like suicide, so untie him. Quickly.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.860
All right.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.960
You sure he won't be able to get free?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.660
After all that booze? No way.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.670
- Hey, bring some more of the booze. - Got it.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.370
Come on, hurry.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.840
Hey, get a good grip.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.510
With how much he drank, it'll be a while before he wakes.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.650
We need to report to Chairman Yang, so let's get a move on.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.750
Right.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.420
Let's lift him.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.920
Throw him in here.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.280
That should do it, right?

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.030
You're sure he's taken care of?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.860
Of course. This isn't our first rodeo.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.700
So, about the payment...

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.400
I'll wire it to the account we agreed on.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.970
Thanks.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.280
You should've taken the warning seriously.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.680
Foolish.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.160
My, how the time just slips through your fingers.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.700
It's gone in a flash, you know.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.600
I can't believe the Miss Korea finals are tomorrow.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.240
I wonder if Yeong Rye is getting any sleep.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.310
You've been in that one spot for a while now.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.110
You're going to wear a hole in the floor.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.250
Careful, or someone'll report you as a spy.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.020
Just leave it be.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.750
Okay, out with it.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.090
Ms. Ma...

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.430
Something's clearly bothering you.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.460
Well...

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.430
Worried? About what?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.300
Just give it here.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.770
Huh? No way.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.600
There's definitely something.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.670
Could it be...

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.040
Is it about money?

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.570
Are you in a hole?

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.610
Money's not an issue. I have plenty.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.180
- Hurry, give it here! - See? I knew you were in a hole.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.450
- Hey, I told you I'm not! - Yes, you are.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.020
Hello, Ms. Lim.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.760
Jeong Bun is working late tonight.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.430
And Su Jin is asleep.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.700
Actually, today I'm here to see...

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.500
someone else.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.940
- About Su Jin... - About Su Jin...

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.010
Please, you first.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.080
No, I insist. You go ahead.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.010
Please. You've seen many more years than I have.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.010
Oh, I don't know about all that...

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.720
About last time,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.660
I wanted to say I'm sorry,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.760
and thank you.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.190
I should have been watching Su Jin more closely.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.200
I just looked away for a second.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.500
No, not at all.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.700
I was the one who failed my duty.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.970
Especially since Jeong Bun had asked me to.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.080
And...

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.260
Actually, on that day...

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.890
I was rather shaken up.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.700
When Su Jin went missing...

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.530
seeing you go pale,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.100
frantically searching for her,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.370
and then holding Su Jin, just sobbing uncontrollably...

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.580
Seeing you and Jeong Bun...

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.790
made me wonder if I deserve to be her father.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.090
That something stronger than blood...

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.830
could actually exist.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.400
And that maybe...

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.570
That's what a real family is.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.640
So...

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.810
I've done a lot of thinking.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.010
I...

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.380
I want to ask you, man to man.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.430
Jeong Bun and Su Jin...

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.130
Please, take good care of them for me.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.300
Please.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.090
Until that darn Cheol Gu gets here from Changwon,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.630
I have to stick it out here for a few more days.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.660
Walking on eggshells around here is killing me.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.170
Gosh, forget it. Whatever.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.040
Goodness.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.040
Hey, you're back?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.450
You look awful.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.720
What happened? Did you fall in a river?

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.860
Why on earth are you still here?

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.420
Get lost.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.830
I'm going to leave.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.200
A friend's coming from out of town in a few days,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.830
and I'll just stay until then.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.600
I told you to get lost!

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.840
Do I look like a pushover?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.010
Do I, you jerk?

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.880
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.680
Let go of me so we can talk.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.780
My life has been dragged through the mud.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.520
I'm just trying to get something back for it.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.520
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.090
Wrong enough to be killed for it?

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.840
This is wrong.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.770
You can't do this.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.040
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.750
I was born with nothing,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.420
but I still tried my best to get by.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
I did whatever the company told me,

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.300
and I worked my ass off like a dog. That's my only crime.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.350
Miss Korea?

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.590
Not a chance.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.890
I'm not going down alone like this.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.160
I'll kill them all.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.050
That was a close one. I almost died.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.200
(Miss Korea Pageant, the Final, at Seoul Cultural Center)

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.210
Miss Korea?

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.410
Not a chance.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680
I'm not going down alone like this.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.980
I'll kill them all.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.250
The look in his eyes was pure crazy.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.560
I thought he was going to do something terrible.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.730
Whatever.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.210
Why should I care about a girl who doesn't care for her brother?

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.960
Where are you?

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800
Can I help you?

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.070
One of the Miss Korea contestants, Seo Jong Hee...

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.570
She's Miss Seoul something, right? Anyway,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.040
I'm her older brother. I have to see her. It's urgent.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.210
I'm sorry, sir. That's not possible.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.310
No visitors are allowed during the pageant camp.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.910
As you know, today is the finals, so she can't see anyone.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.350
I know, but this is a real emergency.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.980
Look, I'll be honest.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.720
I'm a total jerk.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.460
I've never been a good brother to her, not once.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.490
But I've got a really bad feeling about this.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.960
I have to see her.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.500
Please! I'm begging you!

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.600
I'm telling you, I'm her brother!

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.300
God, you're not helping at all.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.840
There's nothing I can do, I'm telling you.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.510
Oh, come on, man!

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.810
Just... be reasonable.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.420
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon!

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.350
Hey, Seo Jong Hee!

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.790
Seo Jong Hee, stop right there!

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.940
We are live at the 33rd Annual Miss Korea Pageant,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.840
broadcasting from the Seoul Cultural Center.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.460
Jong Hee, if it hurts, let me know.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.670
Don't try too hard to relax.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.970
If you're nervous, just be nervous. Show them the real Koh Yeong Rye.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.510
Just speak your mind.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.450
The judges and the audience,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.980
they all want to see that kind of sincerity.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.780
Yes, Director.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.990
Gosh, it's hot.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.360
- Ms. Jo, her blush. - Yes.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.730
A little more colour.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.160
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.770
Our Jong Hee is the best!

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.510
Jong Hee, listen to me.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.880
Whether or not you win that crown...

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.510
Our salon's entire future is riding on it.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.320
You can't forget that. Understood?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.750
Yes, of course.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.020
A pin.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.780
(Daeyang Group, Chairman Yang Mi Suk)

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.420
(Hwashin Apparels, CEO Jeong Hyeon)

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.970
Oh, my goodness.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.970
It's not like I'm the one in this pageant,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.300
so why am I so nervous?

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.310
Hey, give me one of those.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.010
You're having another one?

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.510
I need it to calm my nerves.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.480
Mom, how many of those have you had? That's enough.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.990
Your heart's going to stop at this rate.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.590
Can I have one too? I'm so nervous.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.320
This isn't for kids.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.960
You just pray.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.500
I'll pray too.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.000
Please let Aunt Yeong Rye become Miss Korea.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.040
By the way, where is Jae Pil? Why isn't he here yet?

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.210
It's about to start.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.670
You're right.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.810
He said he'd slip out of work early.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.380
He's cutting it really close.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.280
I'll go check outside for him.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020
Su Jin.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.290
Su Jin, you be a good girl for Mom, okay?

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.090
I'll be right back.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.390
Let's sit up nice and pretty.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.530
Goodness.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.260
Sorry. Excuse me.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.200
The final call was ages ago. Is he stuck in traffic?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.460
He's running late.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.070
Hey, you're going to burn a hole through that clock.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.270
If you're that antsy, just leave it to us and go.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.170
The entire country knows the Miss Korea pageant is today.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.110
You're just itching to go cheer on your girlfriend, right?

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.550
Go on. Go.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.750
We can handle things here, so just go, all right?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.850
Are you serious? You really mean it?

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.750
Thank you so much. I swear, I'll never forget this.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.950
I owe you my life!

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200
Hold on tight.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.600
- Careful. - All right, easy now. Easy.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.310
One, two, three.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.780
What happened?

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.580
He was in a motorcycle accident at the Jeongyu-dong intersection.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.480
He lost consciousness from the impact.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.910
And he has fractures in his arm and leg.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.850
- What? - Unbelievable.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.950
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon!

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.550
Hey!

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.920
You think changing your name changes anything?

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.060
Get the ultrasound ready. Move it!

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.260
Let's go, let's go!

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.130
Come on. Hurry!

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.410
And now, we proudly present the 1989 Miss Korea Pageant.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.910
Let the glamorous festivities begin!

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.450
Oh my gosh, there she is, Yeong Rye! There she is, over there!

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.850
I see her! I have eyes too, you know.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.560
To think the girls we ate and slept side-by-side with in Room 3...

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.860
are now in the Miss Korea pageant.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.290
And two of them, at that.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.300
I'm feeling so ambidextrous about all this.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.830
You mean ambivalent, not ambidextrous.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.670
Ambidextrous, ambivalent. Tomayto, tomahto.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:31.870
Anyway...

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.000
Let's just pray.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.840
That one of them makes it.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.770
But it'd be even better if it was Yeong Rye.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.270
Sir, are you awake?

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.550
Do you know...

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.350
who I am?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.290
We met at the police station seven years ago, right?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.560
I wasn't sure at first, but it really is you.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.530
You were knocked out in the crash,

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.030
but luckily, your organs and brain...

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.030
are fine.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.430
The fractures in your arms and legs aren't too serious either.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.070
But you'll still need to be admitted.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.040
Since we know each other, I couldn't just leave.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.180
Right now...

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.510
I don't have time for this. I have to get to Jong Hee.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.720
If you mean the Miss Korea pageant, you can't go in your condition.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.150
It's not that.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.390
Jong Hee is in danger.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.350
What?

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.720
Who knows what that jerk will do? I have to go warn Jong Hee, quickly.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.600
Our next contestant is contestant number ten,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.770
from Seoul, Seo Jong Hee.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.170
A physical education major at Youngin University,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.240
her special talent is equestrianism.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.750
Hello, everyone.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.820
With a beauty from a balance of mind, body, and character,

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.620
I am contestant number ten, Seo Jong Hee.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.260
I also want to share Korea's beauty with the rest of the world.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.990
That is a cherished dream of mine.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.790
Thank you.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.470
Next, we have contestant number 11, from Seoul, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.470
It's Yeong Rye!

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.110
The eldest daughter in a family of four children,

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.880
she currently works as a hairstylist.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.350
I believe that what's on the inside...

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.220
is more beautiful than what's on the outside.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.690
I am contestant number 11, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.030
As Miss Korea, I will embody that value.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.760
Thank you.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.840
She's so pretty. Our daughter is so beautiful.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.460
That punk, the personnel manager...

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.900
He's lost his mind.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.000
He doesn't care about the pageant. He said he's going to kill everyone.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.900
I even saw him grab a knife.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.050
And now, the eight who will be Miss Korea for one year,

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.110
share our country's beauty...

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.020
with the world and at international pageants.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.450
I will now announce their names.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.900
Contestant number 15, from Daegu,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.360
Kim Hye Jin.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.950
Contestant number 40, from New York,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.120
Pyo Se Rim.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.160
Contestant number 36, from South Jeolla Province,

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.930
Hyun Hae Kyung.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.890
You can't go in right now.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.360
But...

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.730
I have an invitation.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.330
Even with an invite, you can't enter.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.900
- The show is on the air. - But please.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.130
This is an emergency.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.130
You can't, sir. You just can't.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.410
(1989 Miss Korea Pageant)

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.620
The seventh finalist is...

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.450
Contestant number ten, from Seoul...

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.160
Seo Jong Hee!

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.960
Alright, only one spot left.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.860
And our final contestant is...

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.200
Contestant number 11, from Seoul...

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.800
Koh Yeong Rye!

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.970
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.430
All right. For the eight finalists we just announced,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.260
let's have a huge round of applause!

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.910
Now, let's have a little chat with our eight finalists.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.050
And as the host, I'll be choosing the order at random.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.360
Okay, first up,

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.520
Ms. Seo Jong Hee from Seoul.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.460
Yes, hello.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.770
I imagine this is your first time on such a big stage.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.800
A lot of memories must be running through your mind.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.580
So, Seo Jong Hee, what does "memory" mean to you?

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.550
To me, a memory is...

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.150
a bus that's already left.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.660
A bus that's already left?

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.030
That's an interesting answer. Why is that?

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.330
Because a bus that has left...

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.070
will never come back, no matter how hard you chase it.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.070
That's why...

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.910
instead of living in the past, I choose to live in the moment...

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.940
and look forward to the future.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.480
For example?

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.510
If I had a time machine,

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.580
I'd go five minutes into the future...

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.820
to see whether I'll be the one wearing the crown tonight.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.760
Why not take a peek?

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.830
That was a very clever answer from Seo Jong Hee.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.270
All right, next up,

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.310
Miss Seoul, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.210
A moment ago, Seo Jong Hee mentioned a time machine.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.480
If a time machine appeared in front of you right now,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.220
Yeong Rye, where in time would you go?

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.930
I would...

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.060
go back to the time when I was...

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.170
working as a bus conductor.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.810
Oh, so you used to work as a bus conductor.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640
Yes.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.980
For me, that time...

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.920
was the prime of my youth.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.790
And it was...

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.760
when I met my most...

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.860
precious friend.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.930
It sounds like you have many wonderful memories with your friend.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.430
I'm envious.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:32.870
So if you took that time machine back to those days,

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.710
what would you want to do, Yeong Rye?

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.540
If I went back,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.380
I would want to hold...

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.550
that friend tightly.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.890
Back then, I didn't understand...

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.430
what she was going through.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.030
I'd tell her she didn't have to.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:03.970
That she shouldn't be unhappy...

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.400
because of me.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.670
I'd tell her I'm sorry...

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.240
and that I'm grateful.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.710
That's what I would want to tell her.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.760
And finally...

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.460
a bus that has left may not return,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.070
but if you wait patiently where you are,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.200
it will eventually come back around.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.810
That's what I'd want to tell her.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.580
That's a beautiful sentiment.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:56.420
Now, for Koh Yeong Rye's courageous confession,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.850
let's give her a huge round of applause!

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.740
All right, now for the 1989 pageant,

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.440
we'll start by announcing Miss Korea Mi, the 3rd place.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.350
And Miss Korea Mi is...

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.360
Contestant number 19, Miss Incheon, Kim Hyeon Yeong!

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.760
Congratulations.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.250
And now, all that's left is the coveted Miss Korea Jin title...

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.060
and Miss Korea Seon.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.390
The winner of Miss Korea Jin will go to an international pageant,

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.430
receive a 15,000 dollar scholarship...

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.260
and be awarded an additional prize and a trophy.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.930
The award will be presented by last year's winner...

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.370
Miss Korea 1988, Hwang Seon Ah.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.420
She's pretty.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.260
Alright.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.370
Let's see who it is.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.150
And the title of Miss Korea 1989 goes to...

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.400
Contestant number 10, Seo Jong Hee from Seoul!

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.730
Congratulations!

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.010
Contestant number 11, Koh Yeong Rye from Seoul,

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.050
automatically becomes the first runner-up.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.090
Congratulations!

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.630
What about you?

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.630
Do you have a dream?

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.530
Of course, I do.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.870
I...

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.200
I might just become Miss Korea.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.010
Gosh, that's amazing.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.310
I bet you'll actually do it.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:19.660
And now,

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.820
let's hear the acceptance speech...

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.390
from our new Miss Korea 1989,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.960
Seo Jong Hee.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.480
Thank you.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.850
This is such an overwhelming night.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.820
I will never forget this moment.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.790
Thank you.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.690
You both did so well.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.620
Yeong Rye.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.930
Yeong Rye.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.570
Yeong Rye!

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.350
Yeong Rye, look at me.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.550
Yeong Rye.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.060
Yeong Rye. Stay with me.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:09.730
Yeong Rye.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.260
Yeong Rye, look at me.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.590
- Jong Hee. - Yeong Rye.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.360
I told you, didn't I?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.670
I had a feeling you'd make your dream come true.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.970
That you'd become a star that shines brighter than any other.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.540
I wanted to be there to see it happen.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.680
More than anyone else,

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.110
I wanted to congratulate you in person with all my heart.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:34.950
Will I...

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.120
be able to do that?

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.990
Will I ever...

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.560
see you again?

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.940
And in our next story.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.280
An update on the recent incident at the Miss Korea pageant.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.750
A Mr. Noh, who rushed the stage in a stabbing attack...

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.710
and then fled the scene,

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.220
has been arrested by the police.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.150
Police are interrogating Mr. Noh to determine the motive,

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.160
and a thorough investigation is underway.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.330
(Yeong Sik's Restaurant)

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.900
(Closed for personal reasons)

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.010
Darn it all.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.280
You can't even go outside, just lying here all day,

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.350
and your hands get this filthy even after just one day.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.980
I can't tell if this place is just dirty,

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:45.050
or if you're secretly getting up and sneaking around when I'm gone,

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.890
only to lie back down and pretend you haven't moved an inch.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.400
I almost wish that were the case.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.540
Visiting hours are over, ma'am.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.510
I'll stay here, so why don't you go get some rest?

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.080
You're the one who needs to get some sleep.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.390
You haven't slept in days.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.990
Between work and watching Yeong Rye, you must be exhausted.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.230
You're going to collapse before she even wakes up.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.530
No, I'm not.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.170
I'm okay, really.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.280
Hey.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.850
Isn't that the girl who just won Miss Korea?

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.790
Oh, I think you're right.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.630
Excuse me.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.200
You're Seo Jong Hee, right?

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.740
This year's Miss Korea.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.010
You look like you can hold your liquor. Why are you all by yourself?

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.980
Want to join us?

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:17.610
I'd rather drink alone.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.820
Oh, come on. Have a drink with us.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:24.090
Right. What's the fun in drinking alone?

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.220
Join us, won't you?

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:27.920
I said I want to drink alone.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.430
So stop bothering me and go try someone else.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.800
Look, I get that you're going through something.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.910
But it's dangerous for Miss Korea to get wasted in a place like this.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.810
Especially since you almost got stabbed.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.580
We're saying we'll be your bodyguards.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.480
It's free, and you'll be safe.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:54.650
Killing 2 birds with 1 stone, right?

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.650
Get lost.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:58.550
I don't need it.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.430
Now you're just making us look like creeps.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.200
We just asked for one drink. Why are you playing so hard to get?

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.300
Who are you?

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.470
I'm with her.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.210
Get up. Let's go.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.060
Come on, let's go.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.430
I need to take you home and then get to the hospital.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.610
But...

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.480
Don't you hate me?

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.190
This is all my fault.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.460
I was supposed to get hurt, but Yeong Rye took my place.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.800
And do you know what I said to her?

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:21.900
I told her it was all her fault.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.710
That I was miserable all over again.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.750
That I felt so lonely I could die, so pathetic.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.320
I told her all of that was because of her.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.690
I said it was all Yeong Rye's fault.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.140
I don't know everything that happened between you two...

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.410
But I don't want you to torture yourself with guilt.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.710
You both made your own choices.

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:03.980
And this is what happened.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.090
It's just the way things turned out. It's nobody's fault.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.590
Yeong Sik.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.660
I'm so scared.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.500
What if Yeong Rye never wakes up?

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.440
What if I never get to see her again?

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.140
I never even got to say I was sorry.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.450
Or that I still loved her the most.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.580
That's why I hated her even more. I never got to tell her how I felt.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.620
But if she never wakes up, what am I going to do?

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.460
That's not going to happen. This is Koh Yeong Rye, after all.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.600
Yeong Rye will wake up soon.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.900
She will.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.050
She has to.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.700
So, are we sure they've left the country?

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:32.430
If they get caught, I'm in danger too.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.270
Even an attempt, I can't escape a solicitation of murder charge.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.810
I should've made sure he was finished back then.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.040
I gave him an excuse to retaliate, and Jong Hee almost died.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.380
What are you talking about?

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.050
Jong Hee.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.090
What did you just say? Solicitation of murder?

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.160
Don't tell me...

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.670
Mom, did you hire someone to kill the manager?

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.540
Is that why it happened?

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.780
Is that why that man tried to kill me?

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.180
I had no other choice back then. It was to protect you.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.490
How was that protecting me? How?

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.060
Because of what you did, my friend got stabbed instead of me.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.260
She's still unconscious, lying there in a vegetative state.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.770
Her family is worried sick.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:40.540
How...

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.510
How was that protecting me?

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.880
That's not what that was.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:52.610
That's not love.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.820
Jong Hee.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.420
Jong Hee.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.650
Just calm down first, okay?

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.160
- Just calm down. - No.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.220
Jong Hee.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.760
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:17.670
Jong Hee.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.540
Jong Hee, don't do this, okay?

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.340
Don't do this, Jong Hee. Please.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.310
You're just upset right now.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.280
Let's talk about this calmly with me and work it out, okay?

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:29.750
No.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.120
You know it too.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.190
This "perfect daughter" act you've staged...

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:41.460
is over now.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.940
If you walk out that door,

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.810
I'll never see you again.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:54.080
You're going to regret this, Seo Jong Hee!

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.050
Jong Hee.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.970
Are you Yang Mi Suk?

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.840
We're from the Jung-gu Police Station.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:47.760
(Customers will come back when they leave with a smile.)

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:03.180
(Closed for personal reasons)

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.080
Stay here for a while.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.420
Just until Yeong Rye comes back.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.750
If you need to apologise to her...

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.990
When Yeong Rye wakes up and comes home,

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.720
You can tell her you're sorry to her face then.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:38.130
Yeong Rye.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.310
Yeong Rye.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.710
It's a great song, isn't it?

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.310
No matter when I hear it...

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.760
You know...

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.160
I listen to this song hundreds of times a day.

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.570
Somehow, I feel like you're playing it for me.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.880
Like you're right here next to me.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.680
If I don't at least listen to this,

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.950
I can't function.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.460
So...

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:23.100
So you have to hang in there too.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.570
Listen to this song...

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.880
One, two, three.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.550
- Let me try one more time. - Okay.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.450
- Go for it. - Give me the camera.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:25.630
Here.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.430
See that? Did you see? I did it again!

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.710
Jong Hee!

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.680
Han Jae Pil.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.610
Ma Sang Cheol.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.750
Where did everyone go?

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.260
Stop joking around.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.530
Seo Jong Hee!

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.700
Jae Pil.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.540
Jae Pil.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.010
Jae Pil!

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.860
Ma'am, are you waking up?

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.690
Doctor! Doctor Han!

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:47.220
Hello?

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060
Yes.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.430
Oh, thank goodness.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:04.670
Thank you so much.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.510
Wait, wait! Mr. Ma!

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.550
Mr. Ma! I'll go get Mr. Ma!

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.260
- Jong Hee! Jong Hee! - Jong Hee!

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.850
(1 year later)

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.920
In a novel, characters...

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.460
are the key element that drives the narrative forward.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.330
For example,

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.330
in Lee Mun Yol's "Son of Man..."

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.500
The protagonist, through various social...

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.500
and personal conflicts,

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.530
demonstrates growth.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:08.100
This internal transformation of the character...

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:10.170
and the reflection of their external situation...

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:13.640
are what gives the novel its depth.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.550
Characters aren't just there to have things happen to them.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.280
Yeong Rye, come on, we'll be late for the wedding.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:25.250
I'm sorry. I had a last-minute make-up class.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.190
After Jong Hee gave up her scholarship grant for you,

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.520
I couldn't just skip class, right?

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.930
- Get in. Wait, hold on. - What?

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.660
Where's your dress?

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.360
Ho Sook is bringing it straight to the venue.

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.700
Wait, are you sure it's safe for me to get on this?

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.700
Why?

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.630
I'm asking if I can really trust you with my life.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.000
Fine, then you can take a taxi. I'm leaving.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Wait!

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.440
Oh, whatever.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.310
I already cheated death once. Might as well leave it to fate.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.780
Let's go! Go, go!

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.820
All right, great!

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.090
Big smiles from both of you!

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:06.690
- Groom, give me a big smile. - Okay, okay.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.900
- Try to relax. - Okay.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.460
Let's take one more.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.230
Smile!

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:16.040
You've got to do something about those hiccups.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.510
You're making me nervous too.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.510
Want another glass of water? I'll get it for you.

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:22.510
I can't drink anymore.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.910
I already drank so much.

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:27.880
I think my bladder's about to burst.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.850
You're a doctor, aren't you?

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.390
Can't you do something?

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:35.420
It's not really something a doctor can do anything about.

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.690
It's psychological.

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:39.690
You're just feeling temporary stress and anxiety.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:41.760
It seems like your diaphragm isn't working properly right now.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.260
Let's do a breathing exercise. Copy me.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.270
Okay.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.770
I'm sorry. I'm not too late, am I?

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:52.010
Well, well. If it isn't Miss Korea.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.510
The taping for my show ran late. I was afraid I wouldn't make it.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:56.610
Honey.

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:59.750
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.080
I think I need to go to the restroom.

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:04.750
Just wait here, okay? I'll be right back.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.490
But it's about to start...

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:09.320
Come on, honey...

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:10.590
You're not running away, are you?

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.130
Hey, your dress! The dress!

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.860
Hey! I wanted to get a picture...

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.460
Wait!

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.630
What's the point of all of us rushing over there?

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:21.540
Let them work it out on their own.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.540
Still, I feel like I should go check on them.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.810
What's wrong? Why are you acting like this?

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.050
It's just...

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.780
You look especially beautiful today.

01:08:38.190 --> 01:08:39.790
I've wanted to do this for a while now.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.060
This is nice.

01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:50.200
I can't wait.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.530
I was going to give this to you after the ceremony.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.640
What... What is this?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.810
I went to buy a tie, but I saw this and thought it was pretty.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.750
It's my way of calling dibs, to let everyone know you're taken.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.160
You can't take this off, all right?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.830
It's so beautiful.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.670
Honestly, I wanted to give you a ring,

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.700
but I thought that might be too much pressure for now.

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.670
After you finish school,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.940
and when I become an attending physician,

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.280
let's get married then.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.550
I mean, it is a proposal, but...

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.260
this isn't the official one. I'll do that properly later.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.790
But if I don't at least do this,

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.730
I'm just so worried someone else will snatch you up.

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:20.450
(Gimpo International Airport)

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.130
After your meetings, you're stopping in Europe, right?

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.660
For how long?

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.930
About a week or two?

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.730
What? For that long?

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:33.500
Things have been crazy, launching the apparel line.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.600
I've already spoken to my father, so cut me some slack.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:39.370
And as for me,

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.580
don't you think I need some time to get my head on straight?

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Excuse me?

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.690
All fairy tales have pretty much the same ending.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.290
Even "Daddy-Long-Legs."

01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:01.960
"And they all lived happily"

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.200
"ever after."

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640
The End."

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.910
All right, friends and family.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:24.220
Please stand next to and behind the bride and groom.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.890
Big smiles, everyone!

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.320
Nice and bright now. Okay, let's take another one.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.130
Okay, one, two, three!

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.000
Hey, the groom's side over there.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.670
Could you squeeze in a little tighter?

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.910
Yes, and the bride's side, could you move in a bit too?

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:46.670
All right, perfect.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:50.080
All right, perfect. Taking the shot. One, two, three!

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.480
You, there, at the end of the front row.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.420
You're blocked. I can barely see you.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.750
Could you move in a little?

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:01.160
Closer, closer.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.290
Come over here, Jong Hee.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.360
Yes, right there. That should work.

01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:13.370
Yes, great. Okay, hold it right there.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.040
Okay, everyone, smile!

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.000
Everybody, smile!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.640
- Smile! - Smile!

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.810
Absolutely perfect!

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.810
Whoever wants to catch the bouquet, please come forward now.

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:34.190
All right, Bride. As we practised. A gentle toss over your shoulder.

01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:35.520
Ready?

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.330
One, two, three!

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.770
It's all good.

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.710
All's well that ends well, right?

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.580
It found its rightful owner, so it's all good.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:01.920
I got it!

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:04.950
Perfect!

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:07.020
And for the last shot, let's get another one with everyone.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:09.790
One, two, three!

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.160
- Smile! - Smile!

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.400
Bigger smiles! Just one more.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.400
Okay, really, this is the last one.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.600
Be happy.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.400
- Okay, big smiles! - Choi Jeong Bun.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.910
And you too, Su Jin.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.950
Have a good trip, Mom.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.620
Okay, I'll be back before you know it.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080
You know the old saying.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.320
"You follow your love wherever they may go."

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.650
So no more bickering, you two. Live a happy life together.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.220
I'll take good care of Su Jin, so don't you worry.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.960
While you're on your honeymoon, give Su Jin a little sibling.

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:47.800
What do you call it?

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:50.560
- A honeymoon baby? - Right, that's the one.

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:53.200
Why don't you bring one of those back with you?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.770
Oh, Mom.

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.140
- We'll give it our all! - Go for it!

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.070
Hey, you better get going before the sun sets.

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.910
Have a great trip! And take lots of pictures.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.140
- Have a good trip! - Bye!

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:03.810
- Have a safe trip. - Su Jin.

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.810
Be a good girl for Grandma, okay? We'll be back soon.

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.650
- Go on, you'll hit traffic. - Okay.

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.150
- Go on, go! - Okay, we're going.

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:11.420
- Bye, Mommy! - Bye!

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.550
Goodness. They tied so many cans to the car.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.030
I'm so jealous.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.660
They're hitting Gangjin, Tongyeong, and Gangneung on their trip, right?

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.870
Yes. A road trip like that was always Sangcheol's dream.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.670
You have the whole day off today, right?

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.140
Want to get out of the city for a bit?

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:34.810
Okay.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240
Let's do it.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:53.230
Gosh, the sea at Incheon. It's been forever.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.360
Tell me about it. It really has been a while.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.300
Jong Hee.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.440
- You know what? - What?

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.970
Why don't seagulls fly over the bay?

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.470
"Why don't seagulls fly over the bay?"

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:10.380
I don't know, why?

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.680
Because...

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.480
Then they'd be bagels!

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.590
Get it?

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:21.660
Over the bay, so they'd be bagels.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.830
You think that's funny?

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.130
Gosh, don't tell jokes like that.

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.030
Seriously, they're not funny at all.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.570
What? Jae Pil thought it was funny.

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.300
Right, Jae Pil?

01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:38.540
Hey, you two. How could you put me on the spot?

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:41.410
Who knows?

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.510
- I'm out of here! - Hey!

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:44.610
Hey!

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:47.180
Your bag's going to get soaked!

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.920
We're not going to chase you!

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:53.790
We're not chasing you!

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:55.560
- Let's go, let's go. - So long!

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.760
Come on, let's go.

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.660
And so, this is how our story ends.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.590
The story of our youth. It was exhausting and shabby.

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:46.100
But it sparkled and shined because we had each other.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.140
Of you from those brilliant days.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.140
Of me.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.140
And...

01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:58.680
of us.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.620
In the years to come,

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.950
we will be hurt by life's rough seas,

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:06.290
and we will heal.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.020
We will cry, and we will laugh.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.160
But we are not afraid.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.560
Because we will always be together.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.670
And so,

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:23.300
perhaps,

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:26.140
our story is not over yet.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.110
