00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm Su Yanjin,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.000
greetings to you all.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.400
What?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.960
You are Su Yanjin?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.040
The great scholar Su?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.440
Indeed.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.960
How will you prove it?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.440
The General token is here.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.980
(Su)

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.040
You are from a noble family.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.600
A man of upright character.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.040
Then why

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.360
do you call yourself Fu Qinghuai?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.120
Fu was my sworn brother.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.200
He fell victim to the bandits

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.400
and has passed away.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.960
I took on his entrusted duty

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.660
to look after his family.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120
So that's how it is.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.520
It was Tian Xifeng and Pan Cai

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.800
who clouded my judgment.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.080
Thankfully,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.560
the wrongdoers have faced justice.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.280
At least you were spared

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.080
such unwarranted accusations.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.240
I only wish

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.680
that those without power can also

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.440
be free from false charges.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.680
That's only natural.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.680
Natural indeed.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.860
Let's be on our way.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.720
Wait a moment.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.280
The Fus' matter still needs a resolution.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.680
He Qingqing is, after all, a stepmother,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.600
not a blood relative of the Fus.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.140
Should we entrust Xiaosheng

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.480
with running the household?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.160
After all, he is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.760
the Fu Family's only male heir.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.720
So what you mean is...

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.720
Qingqing can't manage the household?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.840
We all know how Qingqing

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.480
treats the children.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.240
She's their mother.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.840
She keeps

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.960
the family affairs in order.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.080
Fu Qinghai

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.480
would surely be glad to see this.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.880
Why can't she take charge?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.440
- Exactly.
- That's right.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.680
The Fu Family owes

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.720
some credit to Qingqing.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.480
She's even helped all of us here

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.680
to live better lives.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.940
- She's capable.
- Absolutely.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.280
But an outsider

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.800
taking charge...

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.440
It just doesn't follow tradition.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.960
Why can't a woman head the household?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.480
I want my mother to take charge.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.680
Whatever a man can do,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.480
a woman can do just the same.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.560
My mother can even do it better.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.680
This...

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.920
Exactly, who says we are less than men?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.400
Who says we are less than men?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.080
Alright, alright.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.920
Everyone speaks with reason.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.880
It makes sense.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.920
He Qingqing's skills and dedication,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.120
I have witnessed them clearly.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640
Since everyone

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.400
holds such respect for Qingqing,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
then naturally she should

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.680
remain as head of the Fu Family.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.780
That's more like it.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.040
Your father often

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.600
shared little stories about you with me.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.220
(In Memory of Father Fu Qinghuai
and Mother Chen Yue)

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.320
He always kept you in his thoughts.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.320
Father.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.040
Xiaosheng.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.520
Mother.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.280
Let's not tell Tangbao, alright?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.400
She knows nothing about it.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.760
Things can stay as they were.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.760
She can keep living happily as before.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.760
Alright.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.920
We promise you.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.240
Xiaosheng.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.680
Even a true man

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.760
can shed tears
when he feels like crying.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.040
Everyone has the right
to feel vulnerable.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.680
You've done an amazing job already.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280
I'm proud of you.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
If you feel like crying,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920
just cry.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.680
Mother.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.320
Father is gone.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280
Please don't leave me, alright?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.880
Alright.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.000
We won't.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.480
You must be exhausted.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.120
Tangbao.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.880
Mother.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.720
You're finally back.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.160
Sorry for keep you waiting.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.400
Good girl.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.880
Can I still call you Father?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.040
My silly girl.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.160
Of course you can.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.720
Father.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.200
He Qingqing.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.120
Did you come to mock me?

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.600
It's all because of you

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.320
that I've ended up like this.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.040
Even to this point,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.560
you're still clinging to your old ways.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.000
Back then, my family was raising

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.320
silver for my brother's marriage gift.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.320
They married me down into your family.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.560
I thought life would be good.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.320
But He Datian had big ambitions
but no skill.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.400
I could only watch our days grow worse.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.000
Why is that?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.880
We were traded away by our families,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.440
yet you ended up living better?

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.720
You have your chains of circumstance,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.880
but why bear grudges against me?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.320
I suffered the same fate as you.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.160
You have everything,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.840
while I have nothing.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.980
All I can do is fight for it.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.600
Is it wrong for me to take what I want?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.200
Fighting for yourself is never wrong.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.980
But it should be against this cruel world,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.200
against the fate.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.000
You and I are both women.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.280
We should stand by each other.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.320
Why make life harder for us?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.880
Tell He Datian.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.720
I have never carried a child.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.120
All that talk is...

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.200
just a lie to make him dance to my tune.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.000
Let him settle into resenting me.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.720
Time to go.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.080
The truth is Tian Xifeng

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.000
actually has something.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760
Her heart holds grudges.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.240
Her eyes see only thorns.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.000
She's bound by jealousy,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640
blinded by resentment.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.420
(Fengyang House)

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.440
Fengyang House is finally redeemed.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.720
Kids,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.880
remember this historic moment.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.200
Open the doors!

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.170
Alright.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.880
Let me do it, let me.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.800
Slow down, you two. No running.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.800
This room is huge.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.800
Quite impressive.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.520
Tangbao.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.560
This is the place
to serve tea to the guests.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.800
You two, slow down.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.200
Alright, stop running.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.440
Here we come.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.080
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.400
It's getting chilly.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.800
Keep yourself warm.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.320
Rock.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.880
Scissors.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.520
Paper.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.680
Alright, alright, it's okay.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.880
Mother will cover your ears.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.800
Tangbao.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.120
You scare so easily.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.020
Xiaosheng, come here.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.520
Or the noise will blow your ears out.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.600
Look.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.200
Such beautiful fireworks.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.480
They're breathtaking.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.200
Tangbao

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.360
likes

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.440
being here with Father and Mother.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.240
Go on, sleep.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.960
Qingqing.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.160
I may have to leave soon.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.530
What?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.540
Under your care, the Fu Family

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.800
has grown orderly and strong.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.880
I suppose that means

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.960
I've honored Fu's last wish.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.960
But still, I must go.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.240
Otherwise my father

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.320
will never let matters rest.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.680
When that time comes...

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.880
it would drag you all into trouble.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.800
I'm not afraid of that.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.880
Even so, I can't take that risk.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.440
Whether you are Fu Qinghuai

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.000
or Su Yanjin,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.400
I have the strength to protect

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.320
you and the children.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.560
Don't underestimate me.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.560
I have never underestimated you.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.120
In my eyes,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.680
you're the sunshine.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.320
You need no borrowed light.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.080
You shine on your own,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.640
radiant and striking.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.600
And I

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.200
have always wished to be your wings.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.800
If Heaven could grant me

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.540
one wish for the rest of my days,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.200
I would only wish

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.120
to stay with you

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.200
through spring, summer,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.360
autumn, winter...

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.990
always.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.200
Then stay here

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.920
for your sunshine.

The Village Chief said

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.480
a distinguished guest

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.880
asked to meet you, the shop owner.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.360
Then make me a dish

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.920
that could

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.480
bring a wayward child back home

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.120
and change his mind.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.840
But I truly can't make it.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.960
So please,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.320
seek someone more skilled.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.960
You stubborn child.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.120
He has his own dreams.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.040
His own way of life

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.280
simply didn't follow

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280
the path you set for him.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
How does that wrong?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.640
And you would forsake yourself

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.440
for the sake of a village woman

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.000
who lost her husband.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440
She is not terrible.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.120
On the contrary,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.160
she is the brightest soul

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.880
I've ever met in this world.
