00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:24.814
I slept with a woman...

00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:26.334
This is insane.

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:28.854
How could I let that happen?

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:08.974
Did she get so shy that she had to leave?

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:15.214
[RAM2 Hospital]

00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:27.974
What an early visit.

00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:30.334
Don't act so nonchalant.

00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:32.814
I have a ward round today.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.454
A 7:30 one?

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:36.334
Huh?

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:37.934
I feel like doing an early one.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:42.854
I doubt your patients
are early birds, Dr. Premsinee.

00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:51.414
Prem, what happened there?

00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:54.054
Yeah, you're right.

00:03:54.454 --> 00:03:56.541
Huh? What happened?

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:58.054
Where?

00:03:58.294 --> 00:03:59.294
On your neck.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:09.614
It's just a rash.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:15.638
I don't think it's a rash, though.

00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:18.774
Rash would have looked different,

00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:21.494
but this looks like a contusion.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:28.067
Wait, is this...

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.774
What is it?

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:31.614
It's a hickey!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.094
Prem, tell us who gave you that hickey!

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.614
Yeah, who?

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:38.134
Uh... it's...

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:39.254
It's...

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:41.254
What's with the stuttering?
Just spit it out!

00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:43.614
Say it!

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:46.374
I was just having fun.

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:51.094
What did I just say?

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:55.774
Don't say that, Dr. Premsinee.

00:04:55.814 --> 00:04:57.334
You're not the type to act on impulse!

00:04:57.934 --> 00:04:59.454
- I...
- Was it a mistake?

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.774
Have you taken morning-after pills?

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:04.368
Don't go silent now!

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:05.534
Have you?

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:08.494
I haven't.

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:11.934
It's almost time for the ward round.

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:13.534
Let's just go and do our job.

00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:16.414
We can talk later.

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:22.634
Tan,

00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:24.214
please tell me that was just one bad joke.

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.334
Bow,

00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:27.414
she probably thought it out.

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.094
She'll probably tell us when she's ready.

00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:34.054
I don't think I can just let this go.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:35.934
We've gotta help her.

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:44.974
What are you two even thinking about doing?

00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:46.294
Tan, is anyone around?

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:48.854
Nada.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:49.894
The coast is clear.

00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:51.454
Alright, then, go be on the lookout.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.094
What's the matter with you?

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:00.494
Here are morning-after pills.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.014
Tan and I bought them for you.

00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:05.774
- I...
- Don't say no.

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:06.854
I understand everything.

00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:08.614
But just hurry and take one now,

00:06:08.654 --> 00:06:09.774
or there'll be a bun in your oven!

00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:12.494
- But...
- Here, take them!

00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:15.654
Prem,

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:17.694
I'm dying to know who that man was.

00:06:20.574 --> 00:06:22.654
Yeah, who?

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:28.894
- What?
- Prem!

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.054
Don't forget your pills!

00:06:33.614 --> 00:06:35.134
Who even is that man,

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:37.334
and why is she hiding it from us?

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:39.694
Yeah, that's odd.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.254
Come in.

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:32.854
Doc?

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:37.174
Uh...

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:41.014
Here are the patient files for today.

00:07:42.014 --> 00:07:42.894
Right.

00:07:43.374 --> 00:07:45.934
Are you okay, Doctor?

00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:47.174
I...

00:07:47.814 --> 00:07:49.454
I need to take a quick break.

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:41.614
Am I going nuts?

00:08:49.614 --> 00:08:50.614
Hello.

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:52.694
Am I seeing things again?

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:56.374
Oh, Miss Pat!

00:08:56.414 --> 00:08:58.774
Does your mother
have an appointment with Dr. Prem today?

00:08:59.554 --> 00:09:00.654
That's in the flesh!

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.534
No, she doesn't.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.414
I'm here to see Dr. Premsinee.

00:09:06.454 --> 00:09:07.774
Is she here today?

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:09.334
She is,

00:09:09.374 --> 00:09:10.854
but she's on a break.

00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:12.294
Please sit tight, Miss Pat.

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.774
She'll be back soon.

00:09:14.394 --> 00:09:15.144
Sure.

00:09:34.134 --> 00:09:35.614
- Doctor...
- Don't say a word.

00:09:36.154 --> 00:09:37.534
Just listen to what I say.

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:39.414
Tell that woman

00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:41.174
I already left.

00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:45.134
Understood?

00:09:46.134 --> 00:09:47.294
Why don't you say something?!

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:49.534
You told me to just listen!

00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:53.374
So you got it?

00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:55.014
Yes, I got it!

00:09:57.934 --> 00:09:59.134
What was that?

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:07.574
Uh... Miss Pat?

00:10:07.614 --> 00:10:12.254
It turns out Dr. Prem said
she had something coming up

00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:13.934
and wouldn't make it back in time.

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:14.894
Right.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.694
Last night, you and Dr. Premsinee...

00:10:51.094 --> 00:10:52.454
slept together?

00:10:54.574 --> 00:10:55.694
Good job, girl,

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:59.694
for cracking such a tough nut like her!

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.934
You crushed it, sis!

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:03.354
For sure.

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:06.054
I think she gets so shy
that she can't look me in the eye.

00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:07.934
I have no idea where she went.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.534
What do you mean?

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:12.614
Well, this morning when I woke up,

00:11:13.054 --> 00:11:14.574
she wasn't there anymore,

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:17.334
and she was nowhere to be found
at the hospital.

00:11:17.994 --> 00:11:18.934
Wait,

00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:20.354
isn't that weird?

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:22.214
Weird how?

00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:25.214
It's like she's purposely avoiding you!

00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:26.534
Avoiding me?

00:11:26.774 --> 00:11:27.654
Why?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.334
We had an amazing time last night!

00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:31.694
How could you be sure?

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:33.934
Did you do something bizarre last night?

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:37.996
People who feel something for each other

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:39.934
don't just disappear like this.

00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:36.254
Why didn't it open?

00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:37.734
The password isn't wrong...

00:12:41.774 --> 00:12:42.814
Prem!

00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:44.014
Prem!

00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:45.774
Are you alright?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:46.779
Prem...

00:12:47.014 --> 00:12:48.014
Prem!

00:12:48.694 --> 00:12:50.294
Prem, would you open the door for me?

00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:51.654
Prem, what's wrong?

00:12:55.854 --> 00:12:56.814
Prem!

00:12:57.294 --> 00:12:58.334
I'm begging you,

00:12:58.374 --> 00:12:59.854
please open the door!

00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:01.134
Prem!

00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:02.614
Prem!

00:13:03.474 --> 00:13:04.474
Prem!

00:13:04.854 --> 00:13:06.174
Prem, what's happening?!

00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:08.454
Prem, open the door for me...

00:13:08.894 --> 00:13:09.894
Prem!

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:11.814
Prem!

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:13.774
Prem, what's wrong?

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:14.894
Prem!

00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:18.574
Prem, please open the door.

00:13:18.614 --> 00:13:19.534
Prem...

00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:20.734
Prem...

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:22.494
Please, I'm begging you...

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.054
Open the door for me.

00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:26.214
Prem!

00:13:26.534 --> 00:13:27.454
Prem!

00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:48.294
You scared me.

00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:50.054
Are you alright, Prem?

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:51.614
Are you hurt?

00:13:59.614 --> 00:14:00.774
That's enough.

00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:02.894
Don't come see me ever again.

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:08.934
I don't understand.

00:14:09.854 --> 00:14:11.414
Why would you say that, Prem?

00:14:12.614 --> 00:14:14.494
And why can't I say that?

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.294
Prem, what's wrong?

00:14:17.694 --> 00:14:20.094
Did I do something
you didn't like last night?

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.334
Let me make it up to you.

00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:23.894
What did I do wrong?

00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:26.614
It has nothing to do with that.

00:14:27.474 --> 00:14:29.074
So what's the matter?

00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:34.174
Please say something.

00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:35.694
If you don't tell me,

00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:37.934
then how am I supposed to know
what my mistake was?

00:14:39.454 --> 00:14:40.454
It wasn't you.

00:14:41.774 --> 00:14:43.294
The one who made a mistake

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:44.454
was me.

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:47.574
I was the one who lost my senses.

00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:49.974
I don't understand.

00:14:50.694 --> 00:14:52.614
What happened last night

00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:57.054
was the biggest lapse
of judgment in my life.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.694
That's not true...

00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:01.374
It was just an impulse.

00:15:02.414 --> 00:15:03.414
You're lying!

00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:07.614
I know you were fond of it.

00:15:07.814 --> 00:15:08.974
Just stop talking!

00:15:09.014 --> 00:15:10.014
I won't.

00:15:12.354 --> 00:15:14.214
I know we felt the same last night.

00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:16.774
I didn't feel anything,

00:15:17.894 --> 00:15:20.134
and I didn't feel
even a bit of happiness, like you said.

00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:22.654
Being close to you

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.814
has only been intolerable.

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:27.894
Let's not see each other again.

00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:29.414
Let this be the end of it.

00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:31.974
No, I won't accept that.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.094
Please!

00:15:34.374 --> 00:15:36.214
Get out of my face...

00:15:37.314 --> 00:15:39.014
Your face

00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:41.654
is only a reminder
of everything that went wrong,

00:15:42.814 --> 00:15:45.414

This way, you can also prove
how Dr. Prem really feels about you.

00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:47.075
you can talk to me.

00:30:48.155 --> 00:30:49.275
I'm willing to listen.

00:30:52.015 --> 00:30:52.595
Of course.

00:30:59.935 --> 00:31:00.935
Sita.

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:07.475
You didn't sleep with a man,

00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:09.635
but a woman?

00:31:11.275 --> 00:31:11.915
Yes.

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.115
I guess Bow and Tan could be at ease now.

00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:18.355
No, Sita.

00:31:18.635 --> 00:31:20.435
They can't know about this.

00:31:20.755 --> 00:31:21.755
Why not?

00:31:22.475 --> 00:31:25.835
Is it that you are reluctant
about the relationship,

00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:31.795
or are you appalled
by the thought of being with a woman?

00:31:33.995 --> 00:31:35.515
It's not like that, Sita.

00:31:36.515 --> 00:31:38.035
I'm neither reluctant

00:31:38.535 --> 00:31:40.395
nor appalled.

00:31:41.315 --> 00:31:42.315
It's just...

00:31:42.675 --> 00:31:44.515
she is like...

00:31:44.555 --> 00:31:46.475
a chaos in my life,

00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:48.955
but, all of a sudden,
I feel something for her.

00:31:49.555 --> 00:31:51.275
Can I ask who she is?

00:31:52.975 --> 00:31:54.715
She was the person who ruined my wedding.

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:00.555
I feel that

00:32:01.915 --> 00:32:03.355
after the wedding was crashed,

00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:05.315
my life has been a mess.

00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:09.435
Nothing goes as I planned anymore.

00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:12.315
That's just the way life is.

00:32:12.915 --> 00:32:14.715
Things don't always happen in order

00:32:14.755 --> 00:32:16.795
or go according to plan.

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:19.515
But it's driving me nuts, Sita.

00:32:20.255 --> 00:32:22.035
I was the one pushing her away,

00:32:22.935 --> 00:32:23.875
but now I...

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.053
Miss her?

00:32:25.955 --> 00:32:27.795
What is it that you're worried about?

00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:30.395
I'm worried that

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.875
if I let her be in my life...

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.535
Will everything fall apart
like last time, Sita?

00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:41.635
I'm wondering if this is what I really want?

00:32:43.475 --> 00:32:45.795
Are you happy being with her?

00:32:46.775 --> 00:32:48.835
If you can answer yourself

00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:51.995
whether or not you're happy being with her,

00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:54.795
I think that's enough.

00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:56.755
Is that so, Sita?

00:32:59.955 --> 00:33:00.715
Prem,

00:33:01.495 --> 00:33:04.555
as a doctor, we face
matters of life and death every day.

00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:06.435
I've seen it all,

00:33:06.475 --> 00:33:09.395
how people regret things in their lives

00:33:10.015 --> 00:33:12.275
on their last day.

00:33:12.855 --> 00:33:16.395
We don't know if something good

00:33:16.915 --> 00:33:18.555
or bad awaits

00:33:18.895 --> 00:33:21.635
until you open your heart.

00:33:25.195 --> 00:33:27.220
Please don't run away
from your feelings, Prem.

00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:58.056
Pat, you've gotta double down.

00:33:58.256 --> 00:34:00.056
Don't show your face to her at all!

00:34:00.223 --> 00:34:01.296
Ticha,

00:34:01.536 --> 00:34:03.296
I can't take it anymore.

00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:04.536
I miss her.

00:34:25.336 --> 00:34:28.016
Didn't you tell me
to hold the hands that want to hold mine?

00:34:49.976 --> 00:34:51.896
Didn't you say you wouldn't go anywhere?

00:34:52.896 --> 00:34:54.336
You miss me?

00:34:58.896 --> 00:34:59.776
Yes,

00:35:00.656 --> 00:35:01.656
I miss you.

00:35:03.036 --> 00:35:04.236
A lot, actually.

00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:38.936
I've never thought

00:35:38.976 --> 00:35:41.096
I could miss anyone this tremendously.

00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:43.176
You started this, Prem.

00:35:44.336 --> 00:35:54.056
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

00:35:54.096 --> 00:36:04.056
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

Please don't run away from me again.

00:39:54.816 --> 00:39:56.456
Since when did you wake up?

00:39:57.416 --> 00:39:58.816
A while,

00:39:59.636 --> 00:40:01.056
but I don't want to get up.

00:40:02.536 --> 00:40:04.416
I'm afraid you'll disappear again.

00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:14.456
I'm not going anywhere.

00:40:14.896 --> 00:40:15.896
Really?

00:40:18.656 --> 00:40:19.696
I promise.

00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:25.885
Promise.

00:40:28.456 --> 00:40:30.016
You're the cutest.

00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:38.496
Prem.

00:40:39.056 --> 00:40:39.856
Hm?

00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:42.976
I don't wanna get up.

00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:46.016
I wanna stay in bed like this all day.

00:40:46.856 --> 00:40:49.616
Well, you're in luck

00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:52.216
because I don't have any patients today.

00:40:52.656 --> 00:40:53.575
Yes!

00:40:53.896 --> 00:40:55.716
You really don't?

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:00.816
That thrilled, huh?

00:41:03.696 --> 00:41:06.256
But you've gotta go take a bath.

00:41:06.536 --> 00:41:08.336
You're accumulating germs!

00:41:08.736 --> 00:41:11.056
Are you calling me a germ?

00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.776
You decide.

00:41:16.176 --> 00:41:17.816
A grown adult

00:41:17.856 --> 00:41:19.456
will figure it out.

00:41:21.816 --> 00:41:23.376
But a germ like me

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.216
is not easily detected.

00:41:28.496 --> 00:41:30.696
I'm fully equipped

00:41:38.216 --> 00:41:39.336
with beauty,

00:41:48.016 --> 00:41:49.016
sexiness,

00:41:58.356 --> 00:41:59.841
and hotness.

00:42:02.376 --> 00:42:04.176
Go take a bath!

00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.256
Fine...

00:42:10.296 --> 00:42:12.296
Miss Spotless.

00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:14.281
Go.

00:42:15.056 --> 00:42:16.456
Come take a bath with me, then.

00:42:19.896 --> 00:42:21.976
Why would you be shy

00:42:22.376 --> 00:42:23.936
when I've seen everything?!

00:42:24.656 --> 00:42:25.918
No comments.

00:42:30.096 --> 00:42:31.536
Prem!

00:42:32.576 --> 00:42:33.549
Yes?

00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:37.016
Please take a bath with me...

00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:38.496
No.

00:42:39.576 --> 00:42:40.456
Yes.

00:42:42.096 --> 00:42:43.496
Doc!

00:42:43.536 --> 00:42:44.656
Yes?

00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:49.496
You need to own up to what you did.

00:42:54.256 --> 00:42:55.256
Alright.

00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:05.136
Are you gonna keep staring?

00:43:06.136 --> 00:43:08.096
Well, I can't help that you're so pretty.

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:11.976
I'll never get tired of the sight of you.

00:43:21.616 --> 00:43:22.776
Prem...

00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:24.070
Huh?

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.416
I'm so happy

00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:30.136
that you don't shut me out again.

00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:37.576
I'm sorry.

00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:39.616
It's just...

00:43:41.556 --> 00:43:43.056
I was confused

00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:45.656
about what to do next.

00:43:48.036 --> 00:43:49.336
But...

00:43:49.816 --> 00:43:51.136
you figure it out now, don't you?

00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:13.256
I love you, Prem.

00:44:21.096 --> 00:44:22.416
Prem.

00:44:23.696 --> 00:44:24.490
Hm?

00:44:24.976 --> 00:44:27.216
I have another favor to ask.

00:44:27.776 --> 00:44:29.016
What favor?

00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:33.336
Can you call me 'Pat,'

00:44:34.576 --> 00:44:36.456
not 'Miss Pat'?

00:44:37.136 --> 00:44:38.979
When you say that,

00:44:41.016 --> 00:44:43.216
we feel so distant from each other.

00:44:47.416 --> 00:44:48.336
Pat...

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:50.322
Do you like it

00:44:50.856 --> 00:44:52.176
when I call you this, Pat?

00:44:54.135 --> 00:44:55.135
What?

00:44:55.816 --> 00:44:57.776
It sounds so cute!

00:44:57.976 --> 00:44:58.976
Do you like it?

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:00.056
Yeah,

00:45:00.756 --> 00:45:02.856
I like it very much!

00:45:03.176 --> 00:45:04.366
Can you say that again?

00:45:04.696 --> 00:45:06.256
Of course.

00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:10.216
I... will do what you please, Pat.

00:45:19.916 --> 00:45:21.296
Let's say that

00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:24.296
we're girlfriends now.

00:45:24.656 --> 00:45:27.416
You're all mine,

00:45:27.896 --> 00:45:31.016
and I'm all yours.

00:45:33.496 --> 00:45:36.256
You can't look at anyone ever again.

00:45:38.056 --> 00:45:40.296
Neither can you, Pat.

00:45:42.336 --> 00:45:43.336
Of course.

00:45:43.936 --> 00:45:45.336
- Promise?
- Mm,

00:45:49.016 --> 00:45:50.176
I promise.

00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:06.096
So this is love.

00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:08.336
How sweet.

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:42.677
[Agreement on Parental Responsibility]

00:46:44.157 --> 00:46:45.437
What is this, Thawat?

00:46:45.957 --> 00:46:46.957
An agreement

00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:50.677
saying I'll support the child financially
until they're of legal age,

00:46:52.437 --> 00:46:53.917
as long as you stay away from me.

00:46:59.477 --> 00:47:01.477
What I want is not financial support;

00:47:01.517 --> 00:47:03.357
it's you, Thawat!

00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:06.114
Are you thick in the head?!

00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:07.967
With you, it's just for fun!

00:47:08.637 --> 00:47:10.637
I was never serious!

00:47:12.477 --> 00:47:15.637
Stop building castles in the air
about us getting married.

00:47:16.237 --> 00:47:17.285
Why?

00:47:18.397 --> 00:47:20.717
How am I less of a person
than Dr. Premsinee?

00:47:20.957 --> 00:47:22.557
You still have the nerve to ask?

00:47:24.517 --> 00:47:25.517
What do you have?

00:47:26.757 --> 00:47:27.757
A family name?

00:47:30.957 --> 00:47:31.957
Wealth?

00:47:34.717 --> 00:47:36.037
Social status?

00:47:36.677 --> 00:47:37.797
None,

00:47:38.557 --> 00:47:42.117
while Prem has everything I need.

00:47:44.397 --> 00:47:47.997
The only way for you to be worthy of me

00:47:48.797 --> 00:47:50.837
is to die and pray for the next life.

00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:57.037
I'll have a new copy sent to you;

00:47:57.077 --> 00:47:58.597
if you still can't come to your senses,

00:47:59.237 --> 00:48:00.757
just raise that child by yourself.

00:48:54.877 --> 00:48:55.637
Pat!

00:48:55.917 --> 00:48:57.597
Open the door for me.

00:48:57.637 --> 00:48:58.397
Pat!

00:48:58.757 --> 00:49:00.717
Pat, what took you...

00:49:01.637 --> 00:49:02.637
Who are you looking for?

00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:05.557
Isn't this Pat's place?

00:49:05.597 --> 00:49:06.917
No. Pat who?

00:49:07.317 --> 00:49:08.717
This is Pat's place!

00:49:08.757 --> 00:49:10.397
I'm always here, so I would know!

00:49:11.957 --> 00:49:13.357
I don't know any Pats,

00:49:13.997 --> 00:49:16.837
and I'm now the new owner of this place,

00:49:16.877 --> 00:49:17.877
okay?

00:49:22.117 --> 00:49:23.397
"The new owner of this place"?

00:49:24.417 --> 00:49:25.677
Where's Pat, then?

00:49:34.477 --> 00:49:36.117
I ordered this for you:

00:49:36.497 --> 00:49:37.837
some clean food,

00:49:37.877 --> 00:49:40.477
perfect for someone as healthy as you.

00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:44.677
You know me so well!

00:49:45.757 --> 00:49:47.597
Well, I really do.

00:50:03.237 --> 00:50:04.637
Is it bad?

00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:08.797
But the last time I ordered this,

00:50:09.477 --> 00:50:11.397
it was yummy...

00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:28.917
I think this is
much more pleasant to taste.

00:50:31.917 --> 00:50:33.957
You're quite a naughty one, aren't you?

00:50:46.177 --> 00:50:47.757
Prem.

00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:49.277
Yes?

00:50:50.397 --> 00:50:52.797
I want this love

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.717
to be serious

00:50:56.517 --> 00:50:57.757
and healthy.

00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.797
It will forever bond us with one another.

00:51:02.477 --> 00:51:04.157
We will not get separated.

00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:07.357
Right.

00:51:07.897 --> 00:51:09.477
We will not get separated.

00:51:24.637 --> 00:51:25.917
Who's calling?

00:51:26.477 --> 00:51:29.797
[Nam]

00:51:39.917 --> 00:51:40.917
You're not gonna take it?

00:51:42.077 --> 00:51:42.997
No,

00:51:44.917 --> 00:51:47.197
I don't want anything ruining our time.

00:51:50.717 --> 00:51:51.639
Alright.

00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:06.957
[Nam]

00:52:10.037 --> 00:52:11.037
Hello.

00:52:11.437 --> 00:52:12.557
Ticha,

00:52:12.917 --> 00:52:15.157
I can't get ahold of Pat.

00:52:15.477 --> 00:52:19.037
Do you know where she moved to?

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:23.557
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

00:52:23.957 --> 00:52:26.077
What I do know is that
you should stop bothering her

00:52:26.297 --> 00:52:27.957
because she's happy

00:52:28.477 --> 00:52:29.957
with her new love now.

00:52:30.077 --> 00:52:31.757
- "New love"?
- Yes.

00:52:31.797 --> 00:52:34.077
Pat has a new love?

00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:35.357
Who is it?

00:52:35.797 --> 00:52:37.917
Gotta go, too busy to talk.

00:52:43.637 --> 00:52:44.917
Pat has a new love?
