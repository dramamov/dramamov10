Enjoy.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.058
Help yourselves.

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:23.477
- One here.
- Okay.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.354
- Hurry up, please.
- Okay.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.068
One sausage, please.

00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:31.653
Okay. Thank you.

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:33.530
Oh, gosh.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.159
- I told you to sit down and wait.
- What?

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.912
Don't wait standing up. Sit down.

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:41.330
Is it going to take long?

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.249
- Sit down and wait.
- Is it going to take a lot?

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:46.086
It's packed. Wait here.

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:38.312
The sons of guns.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.108
What's he digging?

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:52.203
Honey.

00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:17.231
I had no idea.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:19.400
I never thought it'd be a fraud.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:22.279
Who'd spend 100,000 dollars
to do that?

00:02:22.404 --> 00:02:23.530
Did he have a problem with you?

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:25.157
Was he trying to make you
shut down?

00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:26.909
No. Not at all.

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:29.120
Do you know who told me
about this?

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.122
Joo Jung-gi was nothing.

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:33.416
Someone bigger is behind him.

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:34.793
That guy ordered Joo Jung-gi

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:37.212
to run into you.

00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:40.800
How do you think I felt
when I heard that?

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.009
Mr. Lee.

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:46.890
Oh, Mr. Lee.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.603
What if you fall for it
without any idea?

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:54.607
That's why I'm here
in the middle of the night.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.071
So you were worried about me?

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.614
Yes.

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:07.747
I can handle two,

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.417
but what should I do with you?

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:14.338
It's not like I can bury you.

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:17.800
I can't burrow a grinder
at this hour.

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:21.888
I said that to survive.

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.849
Mr. Lee.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.228
Will you help me get up?

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:28.896
I have something to tell you.

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:30.231
You were talking fine
on the ground.

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.359
I know a way for both of us
to survive.

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:35.195
I can't dare to tell you that
on the ground.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.364
- We can't both survive.
- We can.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.366
Mr. Lee, I'm a prosecutor.

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:40.826
We can both survive.

00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:42.870
So? Do you want to hear it?

00:03:57.262 --> 00:03:59.056
I'll say these bodies are unnamed.

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:07.232
This is the reason
you had to live like this.

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:09.484
For a decade,

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.278
you cooked for strangers

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:13.197
and couldn't escape
from this deserted place.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.200
Mr. Lee.

00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.786
10 years mean

00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:20.914
you basically served your time.

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.169
So, since you're a prosecutor,

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.463
you'll say I'm acquitted

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:29.590
and say these bodies are unnamed?

00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:30.800
Oh, gosh.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.387
How generous of you
on the verge of death.

00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:36.306
Forget it.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.518
I'll get rid of those bodies

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:40.686
legally.

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:46.610
You've never been caught
or chased before, right?

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.987
You've never been doubted
or suspected, right?

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:50.030
But here's the thing.

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:52.241
A crucial piece of evidence
will tie you down.

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:53.367
Even if there are tons
of evidence for murder,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.827
people are set free
if no body is found.

00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:58.081
But for you, the crucial evidence
is right here.

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.542
I'll say these bodies are unnamed.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.253
Unidentified bodies,
unidentified reason of death.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:04.213
So cremate it and enshrine.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.053
Then finally, it's over.

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:11.471
It's that simple.

00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:14.183
Only if I say it's unnamed.

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.769
That document is

00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:18.646
in my office.

00:05:23.318 --> 00:05:24.528
What do you mean

00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:27.072
it's in your office?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.077
I'll head to the office...

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:33.288
Go where?

00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:34.498
To your office?

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:37.334
Just tell me to go
to the police station.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:38.961
- That works too.
- You prick.

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:40.212
I have to.

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.382
I have to go there
or there's no other way.

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:43.550
Court, prosecution,
police, prison.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:45.302
I can only get an access
to it in those four organizations.

00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:47.346
Even if I want a warrant, I have
to do it within the building

00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:48.847
because no outside access is
allowed.

00:05:48.972 --> 00:05:50.558
To get rid of the bodies,
I have to go

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.184
whether it's the police station
or prosecution service.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.859
You think I don't realize

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.238
how absurd this sounds?

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:03.990
But it's the truth.

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:06.826
I have to go there
if I want to handle it.

00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.122
I have to download the form.

00:06:10.247 --> 00:06:11.874
But

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:14.627
once I download it,

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:16.128
it won't take less than a minute.

00:06:16.754 --> 00:06:17.755
Then

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.300
you'll be free.

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:22.177
Free. Understood?

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:29.310
How can I trust you?

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.897
Do you want to come with me?

00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:35.567
I won't let you go alone.
We have to go together.

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:37.987
What do you think my brain is for?

00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:39.113
Did you think

00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:41.449
I'd let you go alone
for rambling on?

00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:45.203
How would I ever know

00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:46.872
what you might do there?

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:48.373
And how am I supposed to
trust you?

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:51.377
What if you kill me
after I set you free?

00:06:51.502 --> 00:06:53.671
I'm a prosecutor
who executes the law.

00:06:53.796 --> 00:06:55.924
Yet I'm trying to find you a way.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.551
Why would I go through that hassle

00:06:57.676 --> 00:06:59.428
when you got caught
with two murdered bodies?

00:07:01.847 --> 00:07:03.641
Because I must survive.

00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:07.437
I can't let my kids live
without their dad like me.

00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:11.650
My life depends on this.

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:13.652
It's your turn to tell me.

00:07:13.777 --> 00:07:15.488
How are you going to
let me walk out of this?

00:07:29.212 --> 00:07:30.588
This is getting complicated.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:50.444
Get up.

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:52.738
Get up.

00:07:57.369 --> 00:07:58.286
Hold it.

00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:11.802
Come here.

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:31.074
Why don't you

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.577
tell someone to bring the form?

00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:38.165
There's no one.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.126
Everyone went home.

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.095
If you're fooling me,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.641
we're both dead.

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:54.642
Got it?

00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:06.197
Well...

00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:11.620
I almost died in the past before.

00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:14.874
By the kid who took revenge

00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:16.834
on those who bullied him
at school.

00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:19.838
He killed all the bullies.

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:22.966
When I noticed it,

00:09:23.592 --> 00:09:25.260
he kidnapped me and abandoned me
in the mountain.

00:09:25.803 --> 00:09:26.762
The main police force was out

00:09:26.887 --> 00:09:29.640
to find me.

00:09:29.766 --> 00:09:32.894
Because a prosecutor
went missing--

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:34.104
So?

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:35.564
Are you telling me to serve you?

00:09:38.984 --> 00:09:42.030
No, you reminded me of that kid.

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.247
It's dangerous and...

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:53.543

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:46.695
Hey.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.989
Hey.

00:16:10.847 --> 00:16:11.765
Hey.

00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:15.603
Hey.

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:20.275
Prosecutor Seo.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.362
- Mr. Lee?
- Sung Si-woon.

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:28.576
Don't follow me.

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:37.878
Press the elevator.

00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:41.674
Don't follow me.

00:16:42.717 --> 00:16:44.427
First floor.
Press the first floor.

00:16:45.387 --> 00:16:47.764
Don't follow me.
If you follow me, he dies.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.266
- Get your hand off.
- Off.

00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:50.893
Don't kill him. He's still young.

00:16:51.018 --> 00:16:52.478
Get your hand off the elevator.

00:16:52.937 --> 00:16:54.063
I swear

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:55.815
I will kill you.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.444
Guard.

00:17:01.113 --> 00:17:02.198
Hey.

00:17:02.323 --> 00:17:03.616
Damn it.

00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:05.243
Where did he go?

00:17:05.868 --> 00:17:07.579
How can you miss him?

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.372
I called the police already.

00:17:09.498 --> 00:17:11.250
Where is he? Take the lead.

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:23.055
What the hell?

00:17:24.056 --> 00:17:24.932
Is it broken?

00:17:25.432 --> 00:17:26.809
Mr. Lee.

00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:29.604
- What?
- The emergency bell.

00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:34.151
(Emergency Call)

00:17:34.276 --> 00:17:35.527
Hello?

00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:38.614
It's okay. I'll do the talking.

00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:40.783
I'll talk.

00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:43.536
Is everything okay? Hello?

00:17:47.124 --> 00:17:48.083
Hello.

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:50.503
This is the number three elevator.

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.602
Why is this broken?

00:18:06.062 --> 00:18:08.106
- Sung Si-woon.
- Prosecutor Sung.

00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:09.483
- Who are you?
- Are you okay?

00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:10.817
- Sung Si-woon.
- Prosecutor Sung.

00:18:11.652 --> 00:18:13.112
- 911.
- Prosecutor Sung.

00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:14.280
Are you up?

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.034
The paramedics are here.
Arrest the suspect.

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:19.035
Yes.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.161
Hey.

00:18:23.248 --> 00:18:24.792
- The blood.
- What?

00:18:24.917 --> 00:18:27.670
He's bleeding. Hello? Anyone?

00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:29.923
Over here.

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:32.092
- Take the suspect first.
- Can you get up?

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:33.593
He's going down.

00:18:33.718 --> 00:18:35.554
Hurry.

00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:38.682
Police. Get your hand off.

00:18:40.434 --> 00:18:42.228
Hurry.

00:18:42.353 --> 00:18:43.897
Get on the bed.

00:18:47.067 --> 00:18:48.861
This way.

00:18:56.995 --> 00:18:58.205
Hey.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.331
Over there.

00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.126
Damn it.

00:19:03.586 --> 00:19:05.213
What was the way

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.257
when you said you'd let me
hit the jackpot?

00:19:13.597 --> 00:19:14.890
Watch the news

00:19:15.975 --> 00:19:18.019
in prison.

00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:20.355
Hey!

00:19:30.116 --> 00:19:31.034
Yes, sir.

00:19:31.993 --> 00:19:33.912
Two bodies were found.

00:19:34.329 --> 00:19:36.081
One of them belonged to
the original owner

00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:37.541
of the diner who was
known to have fled.

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.045
Is that why that old man
refused to sell it?

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:43.006
I knew it.

00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:45.050
There's always a reason
when one refuses money.

00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:46.969
That's not all.

00:19:47.094 --> 00:19:50.264
Now that I think about it,
I could've been killed.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.517
Hey, no...

00:19:52.642 --> 00:19:54.018
I could've been found dead

00:19:54.143 --> 00:19:56.897
when this place was getting
redeveloped.

00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:00.234
Okay. I'll pay you for your work.

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:02.820
That wasn't what I meant,

00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:05.073
but thank you.

00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:06.032
Good job.

00:20:10.787 --> 00:20:12.164
Seo Dong-jae.

00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:17.503
What a strange way to help me.

00:20:21.007 --> 00:20:22.092
1, 2, 3.

00:20:25.429 --> 00:20:26.472
Let's turn him around.

00:20:31.352 --> 00:20:32.145
Honey.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.690
- Yes.
- Sir, stay down.

00:20:36.108 --> 00:20:37.234
Clear the way.

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.158
Last night around 11 p.m.,

00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:44.618
Criminal Department 1 prosecutors
of Cheongju District

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:48.122
who were working late
worked together

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.790
to arrest the suspect.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.959
As it was a powerful suspect,

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.419
he fought against us violently,

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.755
and one of the prosecutors was

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.549
injured while arresting him.

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.970
However, we, prosecutors, who
lured the suspect

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:04.182
to the prosecution office
that was off the grid for 10 years

00:21:04.307 --> 00:21:07.394
gathered together
with a strong will to catch him

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:09.396
and succeeded in arresting him
in the end.

00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:10.439
Prosecutor Jo.

00:21:10.564 --> 00:21:13.067
Reporter Shin,
what are you doing here?

00:21:13.192 --> 00:21:15.069
Are you here for the briefing?

00:21:15.194 --> 00:21:16.070
What happened?

00:21:16.195 --> 00:21:18.323
How did you bring the murderer
to the prosecutors' office?

00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:21.159
Oh, no. The murderer happened
to be stupid.

00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:24.204
How did he dare to come here?

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:27.166
In fact, he must've only worked
out his body, not his brain.

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:29.544
He was way too strong.

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:32.881
You know I'm not weak enough
to be pushed.

00:21:33.006 --> 00:21:35.425
But when I faced the murderer...

00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:38.387
Gosh, I almost got killed.

00:21:38.512 --> 00:21:40.431
Were you the first to find him?

00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:41.516
Was it me?

00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:44.895
Well, I was the first
to jump into the scene.

00:21:50.317 --> 00:21:53.821
He was swinging the sickle
before my face.

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:55.740
The sickle was rusted.

00:21:55.865 --> 00:21:57.909
Even a graze would cause tetanus.

00:21:58.035 --> 00:22:00.120
I guess you didn't hear that
in the briefing?

00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:02.289
All your eyes are
shining brightly.

00:22:03.082 --> 00:22:04.417
Good job.

00:22:04.542 --> 00:22:06.169
If we mention Seo Dong-jae's name,

00:22:06.294 --> 00:22:09.047
someone will bring out
what happened in the past.

00:22:09.172 --> 00:22:10.632
I think

00:22:10.757 --> 00:22:13.636
we can compensate Prosecutor Seo

00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:14.887
internally.

00:22:15.012 --> 00:22:16.472
Yes, sir.

00:22:16.597 --> 00:22:18.308
Bring back the diner lady,
murderer.

00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:20.810
Were you cooking with those filthy
hands of yours all these years?

00:22:20.936 --> 00:22:22.312
Bring back the diner.

00:22:23.146 --> 00:22:25.065
How do you feel right now?

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.609
Don't you feel bad
for the victims?

00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:27.526
Did you know you were too stupid

00:22:27.652 --> 00:22:29.362
to enter the prosecutors' office
on your own?

00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:32.073
You've become the dumbest murderer
in history, you know.

00:22:32.198 --> 00:22:34.493
- What?
- Stop him.

00:22:37.913 --> 00:22:38.831
What?

00:22:38.956 --> 00:22:40.875
Seo Dong-jae.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.377
Didn't he just say Seo Dong-jae?

00:22:42.502 --> 00:22:44.045
Isn't he that prosecutor?

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:48.592
(Pretending to be a kind
diner owner after the murder)

00:22:48.717 --> 00:22:49.677
(Cheongju Police Station)

00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:51.804
Lee Kyung-hak, you have a visitor.

00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:56.184
My apologies, Mr. Lee.

00:23:01.565 --> 00:23:02.316
Oh, what?

00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:05.737
I acted up without any idea.

00:23:05.862 --> 00:23:06.905
I'm sorry.

00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:09.324
I'll kill you today.

00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:10.784
Let's all die together.

00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:13.954
Calm down. Sit down first.

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:16.374
Why die? You must live.

00:23:16.499 --> 00:23:17.667
Who the hell is this prick?

00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:19.836
Sit down first.

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:24.174
Thank you for your service.

00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:26.969
We're good here. You may leave.

00:23:27.762 --> 00:23:28.846
Okay.

00:23:32.851 --> 00:23:33.727
Here.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.647
I'm Joo Jung-gi, attorney at law.

00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:37.940
(Attorney at law, Joo Jung-gi)

00:23:38.858 --> 00:23:40.777
- A lawyer?
- Yes.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.195
You're lucky.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.239
If you hire me,

00:23:44.364 --> 00:23:46.199
I'll defend you with my best.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.367
Ha!

00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:50.079
You're the reason
I ended up in here,

00:23:50.204 --> 00:23:51.789
and you want to defend me?

00:23:51.914 --> 00:23:53.207
Yes.

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:56.503
Jail, detention center, prison.

00:23:56.628 --> 00:23:58.630
No other place upsets you more

00:23:58.755 --> 00:24:00.466
with food and clothes
than those places.

00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:01.842
But if you have money,

00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:04.554
people will clean up your dishes

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:06.431
and even your restroom

00:24:06.556 --> 00:24:08.016
like a hotel.

00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:08.975
How much do you want?

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.727
Who the hell is this prick?

00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:13.105
Happiness Diner.

00:24:14.273 --> 00:24:15.441
It belonged to your wife,

00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:17.944
but because you killed her,
you don't have the right anymore.

00:24:18.069 --> 00:24:19.070
So what's the conclusion?

00:24:19.195 --> 00:24:22.074
You have no right
to that property now.

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:23.116
Understood?

00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:25.786
You wish.

00:24:35.047 --> 00:24:36.173
Sell it to me.

00:24:36.924 --> 00:24:38.134
Sign the paper.

00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:39.510
What the hell?

00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:42.013
Didn't you just say I had no right
to it with your own mouth?

00:24:42.138 --> 00:24:44.516
I'll take care of it.
Just sign the paper.

00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:46.435
The lawyer
and your life in prison.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.770
I'll cover it all.

00:24:49.563 --> 00:24:51.190
I can help you hit the jackpot.

00:24:51.315 --> 00:24:53.067
I'll help you make billions.

00:24:54.277 --> 00:24:56.363
I get it now.

00:24:59.158 --> 00:25:00.784
It was the land, huh?

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.912
When he said
I could hit the jackpot.

00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:04.831
Joo Jung-gi was nothing.

00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:07.083
Someone bigger is behind him.

00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:08.919
And you're behind him?

00:25:09.044 --> 00:25:10.879
You told him to scam me?

00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:13.007
Huh? What's he saying?

00:25:14.049 --> 00:25:15.885
I get it.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.307
So that prosecutor wasn't
all about lies.

00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:35.657
It's not so hard to sign it.

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:38.202
Seo Dong-jae.

00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:39.704
Only if you kill him.

00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:48.756
Kill a prosecutor?

00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.841
I'm not a lunatic like you.

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:52.427
How much is it worth

00:25:52.552 --> 00:25:54.554
that you had to chase me here?

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:57.641
And you even suggest
supporting a stranger in prison.

00:25:58.809 --> 00:26:00.227
You're desperate.

00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:05.108
Spend that effort
to kill a prosecutor.

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:06.192
Then...

00:26:08.987 --> 00:26:09.988
I know you're a lunatic,

00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:12.700
but don't cross the line.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.702
Jerk.

00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:18.540
We'll come back tomorrow.

00:26:22.878 --> 00:26:24.338
Seo Dong-jae.

00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:29.135
(For jail visitors)

00:26:35.517 --> 00:26:38.521
(Cheongju General Hospital)

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:40.898
Every corner of my body aches.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.321
Huh? The bowling alley...

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.910
Shoot.

00:27:09.806 --> 00:27:11.558
- Boyfriend?
- No.

00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:17.190
Wait. This is my room.

00:27:25.658 --> 00:27:27.869
Wait. What happened to your face?

00:27:27.994 --> 00:27:30.038
Did that guy do that to you?

00:27:30.163 --> 00:27:30.914
No.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:31.915
No?

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:36.962
Gosh.

00:27:37.713 --> 00:27:38.923
How did you get hurt?

00:27:39.048 --> 00:27:39.924
Are you sure it wasn't him?

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:42.177
No. Can I stay here for a sec?

00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:46.014
No. I'm going to rest.

00:27:46.139 --> 00:27:47.850
I got hurt from riding a scooter.

00:27:53.648 --> 00:27:55.734
I think he left.

00:27:58.612 --> 00:28:00.739
You can't sleep here.
You're a girl.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.533
You're a prosecutor.

00:28:07.747 --> 00:28:09.708
Did you study all night long?

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:12.920
I made money.

00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:27.562
Here.

00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:48.877
It's nice to eat sweets
all you want.

00:28:50.755 --> 00:28:51.714
Are you on a diet?

00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:53.800
You'll know what I mean
when you get old.

00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:27.213
(Cheongju General Hospital)

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.645
Did you get some sleep?

00:29:41.062 --> 00:29:41.938
Yes.

00:29:42.772 --> 00:29:44.608
Is it quiet there?

00:29:44.733 --> 00:29:45.567
What?

00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:50.614
It never happens to anyone,
but why do you...

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.701
Did your office put guards on you?

00:29:54.953 --> 00:29:57.622
I'm finally taking a break in
the hospital. No needs for guards.

00:29:58.165 --> 00:30:00.125
That's not good.
I'll go there tomorrow.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.421
No, it's the midterm period.

00:30:03.546 --> 00:30:05.423
I'm fine.
I'm leaving the hospital soon.

00:30:05.548 --> 00:30:07.634
A serial killer shouted
your name out loud.

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:09.720
Who knows what might happen?

00:30:10.387 --> 00:30:12.014
Don't leave your room.

00:30:12.139 --> 00:30:14.392
Don't let anyone in, okay?

00:30:14.517 --> 00:30:16.477
Okay. Bye.

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:23.444
(The murderer said something
when he was being dragged)

00:30:24.695 --> 00:30:26.405
Seo Dong-jae!

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:29.325
You must've heard the name

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.077
Seo Dong-jae the murderer said.

00:30:31.202 --> 00:30:32.954
That's right.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.582
Remember how a prosecutor
was kidnapped and abandoned

00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:37.460
in 2019?

00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:39.253
It's Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae

00:30:39.378 --> 00:30:40.671
who noticed the murder
that almost got buried

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.758
and resolved it.

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:47.596
However, he received
media's attention

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:50.808
for receiving bribery.

00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:52.518
The 2017 special appointment

00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:54.354
that started with Park the briber.

00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:57.149
That brought multiple prosecutors'
corruption to the surface.

00:30:57.274 --> 00:31:00.361
And Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae was

00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:02.363
on the list.

00:31:10.914 --> 00:31:12.124
Hey.

00:31:12.249 --> 00:31:13.167
Huh?

00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:15.586
Get out of my way.

00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:17.672
What's he doing? Move your car.

00:31:18.381 --> 00:31:19.174
Hey.

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:20.717
(Cheongju General Hospital)

00:31:24.054 --> 00:31:25.055
Come in.

00:31:27.892 --> 00:31:29.644
- Good to go?
- Yes.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.106
You can leave now.

00:31:34.483 --> 00:31:37.152
Why did you waste your money?
I know this is expensive.

00:31:37.611 --> 00:31:39.405
Someone gave it to me
just outside the door.

00:31:40.823 --> 00:31:41.741
Who?

00:31:43.159 --> 00:31:44.494
It's from Ehong Construction.

00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:46.788
Ehong...

00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:50.543
Throw it out. You eat it.

00:31:50.668 --> 00:31:51.961
Why did you take it?

00:31:52.503 --> 00:31:54.464
I thought you should decide
after checking the envelope.

00:31:54.589 --> 00:31:56.216
Check what? It's obvious.

00:31:56.341 --> 00:31:57.968
It might be a letter of gratitude.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:00.930
Open it.

00:32:01.055 --> 00:32:03.391
If it's a letter,
you're my senior.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.059
Excuse me.

00:32:14.904 --> 00:32:16.531
Those pricks.

00:32:16.656 --> 00:32:17.699
I'll return it.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.506
Where are you?
Send me your address.

00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:32.716
Wait right there.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.305
I thought it might mean
something to you.

00:32:38.431 --> 00:32:39.891
Perhaps you helped them

00:32:40.016 --> 00:32:42.143
or worked off their grudge.

00:32:42.268 --> 00:32:44.437
If that's the case,
I shouldn't send it back.

00:32:44.563 --> 00:32:45.397
But

00:32:46.481 --> 00:32:48.776
it has 200 dollars. I'm sorry.

00:32:50.486 --> 00:32:52.321
- You...
- Yes?

00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.033
Never mind. Call the cab.

00:32:55.158 --> 00:32:56.952
I brought my car.

00:32:57.077 --> 00:32:58.328
You had a car?

00:32:58.453 --> 00:32:59.496
I got it yesterday.

00:33:00.372 --> 00:33:01.207
Call the cab.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.128
So he wants to see
who I used to be?

00:33:05.253 --> 00:33:07.756
Fine. The most expensive suit.

00:33:22.189 --> 00:33:25.109
(Club Pitch)

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.382
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
just arrived.

00:33:45.507 --> 00:33:47.092
Okay.

00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:50.388
Stay outside for a second.

00:34:10.118 --> 00:34:11.036
Hi.

00:34:22.132 --> 00:34:23.675
It's for your business.

00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:26.804
A construction worker outside
the city worked his ass off

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.264
inhaling rock dust
to make this money.

00:34:29.182 --> 00:34:30.433
How can I spend
that precious money?

00:34:31.726 --> 00:34:33.645
- How dare you play a trick on me?
- No wonder.

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:37.858
You're about to get billions.

00:34:38.734 --> 00:34:39.986
This is nothing compared to that.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.410
Do you really not remember?

00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:50.373
Right. It was almost a decade ago.

00:34:50.498 --> 00:34:53.751
Still, how can you forget
my gratitude completely?

00:34:53.877 --> 00:34:55.754
I gave you an obvious hint,
but you just don't get it.

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.005
Geez.

00:35:02.345 --> 00:35:03.304
Cheongju.

00:35:04.722 --> 00:35:06.391
9-3 lot in Gokjung-ri.

00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:10.771
When it was only 150 dollars
per 3.3 square meter 10 years ago,

00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:12.773
I, Nam Wan-seong, the Cheongju
construction worker presented it

00:35:12.898 --> 00:35:16.527
to you, Prosecutor Seo
from West Proescutors' Office.

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:22.868
Look, prosecutor.

00:35:23.827 --> 00:35:25.162
That land is

00:35:25.788 --> 00:35:27.582
getting redeveloped.

00:35:28.124 --> 00:35:31.378
It's right next to
that damn diner.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.010
Were you disregarding it
because it's in the countryside?

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.720
Or

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:42.432
did you take so many

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:44.017
that you don't even remember
the small ones?

00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:46.728
Too bad now.

00:35:47.855 --> 00:35:51.234
It increased by hundreds of times
just overnight.

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.735
Wow.

00:35:55.697 --> 00:35:59.243
It became a huge bribe. Damn!

00:36:06.376 --> 00:36:07.711
I'd forgotten.

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:09.630
That's how pointless it was to me.

00:36:09.755 --> 00:36:12.591
And I didn't get you anything
in return.

00:36:12.716 --> 00:36:13.801
It doesn't meet the condition

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:16.137
of bribery.

00:36:16.262 --> 00:36:17.513
Even if it's not a crime,

00:36:18.723 --> 00:36:20.267
you think I have no alternative?

00:36:23.437 --> 00:36:26.565
So? Do you want me to lie down
in your office?

00:36:27.149 --> 00:36:28.276
No.

00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:31.237
Humiliation isn't enough.

00:36:32.197 --> 00:36:35.826
What if I say you took it
from me by force?

00:36:35.951 --> 00:36:37.203
Not that I gave it to you
voluntarily.

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.455
I mean, it's nothing impossible

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.332
considering how you've been.

00:36:41.875 --> 00:36:43.877
Mr. Corrupted Prosecutor.

00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:45.796
- You piece of...
- Calm down.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.256
Calm down.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:50.426
The land

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.723
is yours. I know nothing about it.

00:36:55.515 --> 00:36:58.101
Whether you sell it or keep it,
it's up to you.

00:37:00.354 --> 00:37:01.313
But

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:04.859
make sure I get

00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:07.863
the old man's diner site.

00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:13.369
Hey.

00:37:14.495 --> 00:37:18.082
Did you think a mere prosecutor
was that amazing?

00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.960
Did you seriously think

00:37:20.085 --> 00:37:21.378
I could swap and steal everything?

00:37:21.503 --> 00:37:23.589
Seo Dong-jae.

00:37:24.048 --> 00:37:25.841
Seo Dong-jae!

00:37:26.342 --> 00:37:28.344
That damn old man

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:31.222
went wild and shouted
your name on TV with grudges.

00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:33.183
Seo Dong-jae.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.230
Tell him

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:40.733
that I sent you.

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.069
Beg him with your all.

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:46.490
Whether you go on your knees
or cry your heart out.

00:37:46.615 --> 00:37:48.617
It costs you nothing,
and it's not illegal.

00:37:49.493 --> 00:37:50.536
Then

00:37:51.537 --> 00:37:53.456
you'll never have to see me again.

00:38:00.422 --> 00:38:01.632
Kiss my ass.

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:07.722
Gosh, I had no clue 10 years ago.

00:38:07.847 --> 00:38:09.933
I never expected it
to turn out like this!

00:38:14.105 --> 00:38:14.939
Hooray.

00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:17.734
Yes!

00:38:29.455 --> 00:38:31.958
Hey! West Prosecutors' Office.

00:38:32.417 --> 00:38:34.002
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:38:57.362 --> 00:38:58.739
Kill them all.

00:38:58.864 --> 00:39:01.701
- Get your tools.
- Let's kill them all.

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:04.662
Have a good time. I'm off now.

00:39:06.498 --> 00:39:07.832
How tiring.

00:39:10.669 --> 00:39:11.754
What the hell?

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.634
You prick.

00:39:16.759 --> 00:39:17.760
Get your ass over here.

00:39:19.763 --> 00:39:21.014
Hey, Park Chan-hyuk.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.814
- You can't pass through.
- I have to go.

00:39:27.939 --> 00:39:29.899
What's up? What brings you here?

00:39:30.024 --> 00:39:31.401
Oh, no.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.781
Don't be scared. You expected us

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:36.949
when you backstabbed us.

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.826
No.

00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:41.079
- Come here, punk.
- No.

00:39:47.544 --> 00:39:49.004
Believe me.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.050
I didn't siphon it. It got stolen.

00:39:52.175 --> 00:39:54.386
Right? Who dares to mess
with Choi Geum-ho's item

00:39:54.511 --> 00:39:56.680
in Cheongju?

00:39:56.805 --> 00:39:57.723
The thieves spread

00:39:57.848 --> 00:39:59.641
what's out in the market, huh?

00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:00.893
Yes.

00:40:01.018 --> 00:40:02.853
Trust me. It wasn't me.

00:40:02.979 --> 00:40:04.772
You little...

00:40:04.897 --> 00:40:05.940
Please.

00:40:14.575 --> 00:40:16.327
- Hurry up.
- Get in there.

00:40:16.452 --> 00:40:18.413
Two here. Two there.
To your right.

00:40:18.538 --> 00:40:20.373
Sir, the police are here.

00:40:20.499 --> 00:40:21.291
Damn it.

00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:23.585
Tell Choi Geum-ho it's him next.

00:40:24.253 --> 00:40:25.379
Let's go.

00:40:27.757 --> 00:40:29.259
Shoot.

00:40:32.053 --> 00:40:33.388
(Mr. Won's boys were here.
And the police too)

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.351
Over there.

00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:40.521
Get him.

00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:45.569
He took off again.

00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:47.237
- What the hell?
- They all took off.

00:40:47.363 --> 00:40:49.490
Tell me your name. What?

00:40:50.157 --> 00:40:51.409
What's your name?

00:40:52.035 --> 00:40:52.952
Park Chan-hyuk.

00:40:53.077 --> 00:40:54.621
He's the puppet boss
Choi Geum-ho hired.

00:40:54.746 --> 00:40:56.373
He's Choi Geum-ho's
brother-in-law.

00:40:56.498 --> 00:40:59.835
The paper says the bar belongs
to Park Chan-hyuk,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.463
but it's where Choi launders
the money he made with drugs.

00:41:02.588 --> 00:41:04.590
It's impossible for the police
not to know.

00:41:04.716 --> 00:41:06.676
The police were probably after
the Cheongju head drug dealer.

00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:08.261
I think they'll summon Choi
to investigate--

00:41:08.386 --> 00:41:09.388
Why did they raid it?

00:41:09.513 --> 00:41:11.014
I'll have to find out. So--

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.058
You have a snitch there.

00:41:13.184 --> 00:41:14.518
- What did he say?
- I can't get ahold of him.

00:41:14.644 --> 00:41:17.564
We should've declined
the warrant request.

00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:18.815
If the police get their hands
on it,

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.525
Choi will take off at that moment.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.319
Don't let the police
approach Choi.

00:41:22.444 --> 00:41:23.487
Thank you, ma'am.

00:41:24.321 --> 00:41:25.865
- Captain.
- Spill it out.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.866
One second.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.706
The bar search warrant
was declined.

00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:34.291
Gosh.

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:35.542
Is it the one in charge of drugs?

00:41:35.668 --> 00:41:37.169
Yes, Jo Byung-gun.

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:39.547
Why not? Request it again.

00:41:40.882 --> 00:41:41.966
Request it until we get it.

00:41:43.093 --> 00:41:44.094
Yes, sir.

00:41:59.403 --> 00:42:01.572
- Geum-ho.
- Don't get up.

00:42:01.697 --> 00:42:02.990
Okay.

00:42:04.325 --> 00:42:08.079
They were mistaken big time.

00:42:08.663 --> 00:42:10.499
They think we stopped selling it
to them

00:42:10.624 --> 00:42:13.002
because we joined hands
with a new dealer.

00:42:18.174 --> 00:42:19.217
Geum-ho.

00:42:19.342 --> 00:42:20.510
(Dong-pal)

00:42:20.635 --> 00:42:21.553
Only if

00:42:22.846 --> 00:42:24.807
I hadn't passed out...

00:42:24.932 --> 00:42:27.560
The number you have dialed is...

00:42:27.685 --> 00:42:29.145
Look at this prick.

00:42:31.189 --> 00:42:32.107
Take care.

00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:34.943
No, Geum-ho.

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:36.278
You should...

00:42:36.904 --> 00:42:39.157
They said you're next.

00:42:42.953 --> 00:42:44.371
Keep your eye on him.

00:42:54.841 --> 00:42:55.884
What if that jerk is mistaken?

00:42:56.009 --> 00:42:57.469
Because he bribed so many.

00:43:27.128 --> 00:43:30.465
Prosecutor Seo, let me get you
a glass of water.

00:43:31.258 --> 00:43:32.134
Prosecutor?

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:34.845
Drinking from early morning...

00:43:44.022 --> 00:43:44.981
Here.

00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:49.028
- I don't take this.
- It's okay.

00:43:56.578 --> 00:43:59.456
Cheongju. 9-3 lot in Gokjung-ri.

00:44:00.207 --> 00:44:03.044
When it was only 150 dollars
per 3.3 square meter 10 years ago,

00:44:03.169 --> 00:44:05.213
I, Nam Wan-seong, the Cheongju
construction worker presented it

00:44:05.338 --> 00:44:08.800
to you, Prosecutor Seo
from West Prosecutors' Office.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.849
(Gokjung-ri, Jangam-dong,
Cheongju-si, Chungcheong Province)

00:44:16.267 --> 00:44:18.687
(Seller Nam Wan-seong,
Buyer Seo Dong-jae)

00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:21.356
Buy this land no matter what.

00:44:22.065 --> 00:44:23.943
He happened to take the best part.

00:44:24.235 --> 00:44:25.236
But

00:44:25.611 --> 00:44:27.697
drag it out as much as we can.

00:44:27.822 --> 00:44:29.324
Make sure to keep solicitors out.

00:44:29.449 --> 00:44:30.283
Yes, sir.

00:44:30.825 --> 00:44:33.537
What if the prosecutor decides
to sell it for a high price?

00:44:34.246 --> 00:44:35.414
If he wants to charge you
for how much it went up,

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:37.291
there's no point in retrieving.

00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:40.294
Buy it.

00:44:44.674 --> 00:44:46.593
If Prosecutor Seo insists

00:44:46.718 --> 00:44:49.263
on making a profit,

00:44:51.682 --> 00:44:54.060
our relationship will
continue to prolong.

00:44:55.395 --> 00:44:58.482
Gosh, I had no clue 10 years ago.

00:44:58.607 --> 00:45:00.609
I never expected it
to turn out like this!

00:45:02.236 --> 00:45:04.238
I was the clueless one.

00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:07.158
Because I continued
to live like that.

00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:14.667
(Wife)

00:45:19.464 --> 00:45:20.966
Hey.

00:45:21.633 --> 00:45:23.677
Yes, I'm driving.

00:45:24.595 --> 00:45:26.138
I'll be home soon.

00:45:26.597 --> 00:45:28.057
Okay. Bye.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.453
It increased by hundreds of times

00:45:46.578 --> 00:45:48.330
just overnight.

00:45:48.455 --> 00:45:49.832
Wow.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.462
It became a huge bribe. Damn!

00:45:55.922 --> 00:45:57.132
I never asked for it.

00:45:59.551 --> 00:46:01.220
I didn't take it
because I wanted to.

00:46:03.264 --> 00:46:04.557
He forced me!
