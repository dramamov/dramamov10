[Intensive Care Unit]

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.040
What's the situation?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.110
He went in for an operation, so we'll have to wait and see.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.950
How was Kim Hyeong Bok's status in the ambulance?

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.160
The emergency medical team must've explained the situation, right?

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.750
It's not looking good.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.440
Yes?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.110
I'm a little busy right now.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.830
I'll call you later when I have time─

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.330
Excuse me?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.660
I think the person who stole it put it back.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.520
It's almost the same amount that was stolen.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.700
I'll give you three days.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.280
Put the ginseng you stole back in the field within that time.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.990
If you sold them, buy them back and return them. You have three days. Leave.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.450
Excuse me?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.750
It's Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.240
He's the one that brought them back here. He's...

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.550
just a simple thief.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.180
For now, let's go back to the hospital.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.560
I don't think we need to go back.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.070
I just got a text. He passed away.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.140
Our members didn't do anything that would be a problem at the scene, right?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.400
No. Not at all. He got in an accident while running away.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.030
That's good then. Good.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.570
Kim Hyeong Bok...

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.730
Shouldn't we contact his family?

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460
Of course, we should.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.480
I'll call Kim Hyeong Bok's mother then.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.140
No. Telling her in person is the right thing to do.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.160
We also have to explain the situation.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.960
Hey, Byeon Ji Woong, Ji Man Goo, you two go.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.030
Why us?

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360
Do you think Do Chang's rank is low enough to do such grunt work?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.100
You should've been volunteering, even if I didn't make you do it!

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400
That's true, but I have an upset stomach.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.200
My shoulder's been hurting these days.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.370
So? Are you saying you don't want to go?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.050
No, it's not that I don't want to go.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.010
She reminds me of my mother.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.150
Stop it. Hyeong, you and I should go.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.510
Jae Hong and I will go.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.850
Hey! I have to write the incident report.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.780
Don't worry about the report. I'll write it for you, so you two go.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.810
Hey, Byeon Ji Woong, Ji Man Goo,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.300
you don't see me as superior anymore now that you've worked here a few years?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.760
I guess I should recalibrate your sense of high and low today.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.060
Follow me with your eyes down.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.200
What? Why are you going and turning this into some '88 vibe?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.130
What, you bastard? What did you just say?

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.600
- What?
- Ji Man Goo. Eyes down. I said, eyes down.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.150
Close your eyes, you bastard!

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.090
- Why do I need to close them?
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.750
It's fine. This is something I have to do anyway.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.970
I can go on my own.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.970
I'll come along.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.030
Everyone, attention!

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.180
I heard you guys caught Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.580
Yes, but Kim Hyeong Bok is a little─

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.210
In any case, you guys caught a serial killer.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.980
Chief, Kim Hyeong Bok, he's─

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.930
Hey, don't think about it too much.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.860
We caught someone even the MIU couldn't catch after working three months straight.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.650
Good job.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.950
Team 2, it's been a while, but you've lived up to your reputation.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.540
Good job. Especially you, Kang Do Chang.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.040
Someone has died.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.340
Let's keep some basic respect as humans.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.520
As expected, Kang Do Chang.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.950
You're full of charisma!

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.430
Don't you think he's full of humane charm?

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.310
Dead or alive,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.240
we detectives just need to capture the perpetrator.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.790
The guy who catches the perpetrator takes it all in this profession!

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.950
Winner takes all!

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.950
You know?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.530
I was too hasty.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.500
I should've waited until the others came, and blocked off the escape route before catching him.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.480
It's my mistake.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.810
If we hadn't chased him

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.910
and let the MIU take care of it, things wouldn't have gone this far.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.600
But because we made a fuss saying we would catch him first...

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.180
Chief,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.830
I'm still a bit concerned about MIU.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.770
Shouldn't we let them know as quickly as possible?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.800
We should. We just need to let them know, whatever the method, right?

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.690
Hey, Reporter Jeong, do you think you can gather all the authorized reporters today?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.780
Come on,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.170
what does it mean when a chief is stepping forward?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.850
Do you think I would contact the reporters if we caught some random thief?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.780
Why?

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.220
Did my Hyeong Bok─

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.810
Well... Ma'am... It's...

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.000
- Mr. Kim Hyeong Bok passed away due to a traffic accident.
- What?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.790
Wait.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.700
What happened to my Hyeong Bok?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.900
The truth is... we...

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.830
Kim Hyeong Bok was illegally crossing the road, trying to avoid a police chase,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.500
and after being hit by a car, he was moved to the hospital and died during the operation.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.980
If there is any doubt about the cause of death or whether it was negligence,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.310
we will send you the document with details of the incident at a later date.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.540
Hey, you...

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.570
Where... where is he? My Hyeong Bok,

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.120
where is he right now?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.070
Please get out of here.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.140
I have something to tell my Hyeong Bok,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.150
so get out. Get out.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.020
I said get out.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.990
Isn't it enough that you caught my son as a murderer?

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:57.340
Stop terrorizing my son and get out, please!

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.490
Hyeong Bok...

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.390
you met such a bad mother,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.150
and all you did was struggle.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.000
If you are reborn,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.000
meet good parents

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.300
and live a happy life. Okay?

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.510
And don't ever, ever do anything sinful.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.070
Okay?

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.410
Hey,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.970
did you have to talk like that to a mother who just lost her son?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.330
He died because of us. Do you even have an ounce of remorse─

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.900
It's not something you should feel remorse about.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.010
You made up that feeling on your own.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.260
Kim Hyeong Bok was a simple thief. He wasn't a killer. He shouldn't have died like that.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.470
It's not a situation you created.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.130
Why do you keep making things bad for yourself? Why?

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.610
If I... was just a little bit more attentive back then.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.770
Then go and tell his mother.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.120
"I killed Hyeong Bok."

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.710
Stop making up a crime that doesn't exist,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.060
and putting it on yourself.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.480
It's the same thing

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.000
as a detective convicting an innocent person.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.340
I'm sorry.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.630
I'm so sorry.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.430
There's nothing to be sorry about.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.050
He has paid for his sins.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.600
I believe he was punished.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.910
Ma'am,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.190
Hyeong Bok is not a murderer.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.860
Don't believe what they say on the news.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.020
I'll make things right.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.160
It's okay.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.770
What difference... would that make?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.780
At about 14:00 (2:00pm) today,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:41.390
Kim Hyeong Bok, a suspect in the White Gown Serial Murder case, which had four different incidences,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.840
has died at a hospital under the jurisdiction of the Incheon West Police Station.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.250
Suspect Kim Hyeong Bok died in a car accident while running away

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.020
from our team's persistent pursuit.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.900
Do you have any questions?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.870
Yes?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.000
Seoul MIU released a national manhunt notice just today.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.570
You were able to find the suspect in such a short amount of time?

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.130
Yes.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.290
At the time, we happened to be already investigating Kim Hyeong Bok

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.920
for a case unrelated to the serial murders, and due to my judgement,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.550
we were convinced that he had a connection to the serial murders.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.540
Yes?

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.360
According to the information we have gathered

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.900
- No, I'm sorry. We didn't know.
- on Kim Hyeong Bok,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.960
- We have the evidence,
- the violent crimes team stayed up at night,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.150
- so we will do the official briefing─
- and narrowed the investigation.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.180
- Coffee?
- That is how we were able to

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.160
- Yes. Let's go.
- finally find the suspect.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.350
Are there any other questions?

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.040
So, if not,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.940
the Incheon West Violent Crimes team and I

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.960
will strongly stand against violent crimes

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.120
that make our citizens shake in anxiety.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.930
- Thank you.
- Damn it!

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.430
Yes?

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.840
Hey.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.260
- Are you studying?
- Yes.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.370
Now that I think of it, you have your GED exam soon, don't you?
(GED = General Educational Development)

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.850
Yeah.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.630
Don't be too anxious, and just do the best of your capabilities.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.190
I'm sure you'll make it then.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.210
Don't stay up too late.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.520
Okay.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.270
- Ahjussi.
- Yes, what? Do you need something? Ask me for anything.

Her face was too pretty to be in a legal team.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.090
According to the police report, a year before the incident happened,

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.460
Kim Hyeong Bok had a record of stalking a nurse.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.660
That became the motive to put white gowns on the victims and murder them.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.560
So then why did the perpetrator

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.820
not commit any crime against the nurse that he stalked,

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.710
and instead chose unrelated women as victims?

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.420
There's a tendency for people to mistake serial killers as impulsive,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.250
but that's not true at all.

- Hello, Hyeongnim. What can I do for you?
- he knew that he would be found out quickly...

Then why?

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:46.370
Why did he come to the company that Jeong Hui Joo worked at?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.860
He has found something.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.620
The really funny thing is,

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.900
that I wasn't a nurse when I was dating Hyeong Bok.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.880
I was preparing to become a nurse at the time.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.150
We broke up after just a few months,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.380
so he never even saw me wearing a nurse uniform.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.410
Did you tell that to the MIU detective too?

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.340
Yes, of course.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.830
They acted like they understood back then,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:20.860
but then on the news, they're saying that he put on the white gown and murdered them because of me.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.310
So it's been weighing me down.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.810
Are the reports that he stalked you true?

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.220
Excuse me?

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.550
Do you know why I broke up with him?

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.170
It's because when we were in a relationship, he was seeing another woman.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.410
Why would a person like that stalk me?

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.730
According to the phone records, he kept calling you, though. Why was that?

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.130
He kept asking me to give him back the ring he gave me while we were dating, like a loser.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.620
I didn't answer the phone. I would be crazy to give it back.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.440
It's better to sell it.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.000
Can you see how full of holes the Seoul MIU's suggestion for

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.380
Kim Hyeong Bok's motive was?

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.030
So what are you trying to say?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.550
Kim Hyeong Bok is not the perpetrator.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:14.200
Hey, a detective is supposed to find evidence that proves guilt.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.520
Why is a detective finding evidence that proves that they aren't guilty? Why?

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.770
Are you guys defense lawyers?

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.700

Well,

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.580
I'll give you some advice as a seonbae.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.470
If, by chance, Kim Hyeong Bok is not the real perpetrator,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.030
this is a perfect crime for the real perpetrator.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.930
What's the chance that he would commit another crime? None.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.970
Bury it. All of it.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.530
He's the real one. There's no reason to bury it on purpose.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.260

Oh Ji Hyeok, and his partner Kang Do Chang.

Keep them safe and give them back to us when we find the real perpetrator of the serial murder case.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:16.120
I'll treat this as a crazy outburst after day-drinking.

Take these back, please. I beg of you.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.600
Kim Hyeong Bok is not a serial killer.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.060
The Seoul MIU found evidence.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.240
They said that the button that was found at the crime scene came off Kim Hyeong Bok's shirt.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.410
I ripped it off him when I was chasing him.

You know that we caught him near the crime scene as well.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:41.100
MIU made Kim Hyeong Bok into a killer.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.550
I'm warning you.

If you bring that case up again...

Kang Do Chang, the people who work under you,

If you go that far, then I have no choice.

I don't want to overdo it and make them suffer, however,

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.930
Oh Ji Hyeok is the problem.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.120
What about him?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.960
He doesn't even know how much the salary that goes into his bank account is.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.100
He doesn't care because it's such a little amount.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.070
He wouldn't have any issues living even if he quit being a detective.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.180
And? So what?

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.430
I'm saying he's uncontrollable.

If he decides to go to the media and tell them about what we just said along with the data we gathered,

how would that make you look? The chief, who publicly briefed that we caught the perpetrator.

Hey, Oh Ji Hyeok, what was your nickname at MIU? Was it "Headache"?

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.670
No... not just a normal headache.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.430
It was "Mega headache."

The fact that he gave you a week off... Give me this.

Right, this. Doesn't he want you to drop this investigation?

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.840
It means that he won't care what we do during this week off.

Probably Hui Joo couldn't leave yet either.

You deleted all the data, right?

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:58.990
Yes. The other guys deleted everything on their computers, and I checked personally.

Wait a moment. I'll deal with it.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.590
Let's talk.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:08.620
Can you explain the reason why you became the first witness?

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.650
You know Jeong Hui Joo, right?

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:15.400
Her grandfather said he wanted to see the crime scene, so we came with him and found this.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.030
You weren't here due to other information?

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.870
Not at all.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.740
I heard you were digging into this case on your own.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.790
Aren't you here because there's something else?

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.190
Did you hear about me from Team Leader Choi Yong Geun?

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.870
You must be close with him.

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.760
Don't change the subject and tell me the truth.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.360
You knew something about the guy who committed this crime, didn't you?

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.530
We would have said something if we knew anything.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.100
There's no reason to hide it when we're both cops.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.650
The only thing we know is

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:47.400
that Kim Hyeong Bok is not the real perpetrator.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.790
Isn't it time you accept this fact?

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.260
The culprit is using this case to say,

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.590
"The real culprit isn't Kim Hyeong Bok, it's me."

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.970
What do you know about the case to make such a fuss?

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:02.560
This is my case! It's not your case!

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.990
Don't you dare jump to conclusions and make trouble.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:10.380
Also, Kim Hyeong Bok, if you had given him to us to handle, he wouldn't have died.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.180
What? You bastard...

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.550
Really, you little...

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.740
- Let go! Seriously!
- Stay still.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.280
What good did you do?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.300
You're the one who made the innocent Kim Hyeong Bok into a killer, you bastard!

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.260
Since we're done with the witness testimony, can we leave?

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.210
Take all your people, too.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.840
We'll take over the crime scene.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.530
- What? Hey, what do you think you're saying?
- Hyeongnim,

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:35.550
let me talk.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.440
You closed the serial murder case, and thus this is a separate case.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.050
Why should we hand over the case?

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.210
You'll get an official statement later.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:49.350
If you have any objections after taking a look at that, send it through your team leader.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.980
Okay, understood. Let's go.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.440
Hey! Why do I have to listen to this bastard?

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.630
He's saying it's h-h-his case.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.890
This means that he doesn't see this as a separate case from the serial murder case.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.950
He just accepted it, so we should let him have it. Let's go.

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:08.620
Let's go.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.370
Why is this your case, you bastard?

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.060
This is the victim and their family's case!

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.180
You bastard, your thoughts are rotting away!

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.770
- Let's go.
- You bastard!

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.530
Hyeongnim!

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.810
What a mess it is over there.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.110
Hui Joo,

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:38.240
I think...

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.930
I have to meet you a little later.

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.950
We will catch them first for sure this time.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:57.890
They're holding the crime scene.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:59.980
They'll get the confirmation of the victim's identity,

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.240
and get the crime scene evidence first as well. We're already late from the start.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.900
None of that matters.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.170
The person who moves their feet first will be in the lead.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.290
Hey, Ji Woong, when you get to the station,

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:17.710
check all the missing persons reports near the crime scenes for women in their twenties.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.620
What are you going to do?

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.650
The commissioner trusts that we caught the culprit.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.770
There's no evidence that Kim Hyeong Bok is not the culprit.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.190
He's dead, you idiot!

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.410
Do you think a dead person did something like this?

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.970
Before you catch the real culprit,

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:45.330
first think about how we're going to deal with

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:47.500
this crappy situation.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.260
Team Leader, the media has gathered down there.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.210
What?

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.420
Which bastard...?

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:05.120
They can find out the identity in two hours if they're quick.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:09.700
Don't worry. They'll take longer because their attention is diverted.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.010
- What did they say?
- They were able to reach their daughter 30 minutes ago.

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:19.110
She called from her friend's phone because her battery ran out.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.030
All missing person reports so far have been checked, right?

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.060
Yes. So far.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.630
One second. They got a missing person report just now.

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:27.040
A female college student in her 20's. After leaving a meeting on campus

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.150
and heading home, that was the last contact with her.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:30.530
The address is

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.870
the same place as the first murder scene.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:37.310
We don't have much time, so let's divide the workload.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:39.870
- Why won't they let us in?
- Let us through.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.850
Reveal the crime scene quickly!

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:45.020
Who's the person in charge here? Come down and tell us!

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.680
- What's the reason for not telling us anything?
- Give us information!

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.550
There! Here they are! There he comes!

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:55.100
While we haven't found out the identity of the victim yet,

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.050
the victim was wearing a white gown,

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.380
and she was found with red lipstick on her lips.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.420
- Is it the white gown murderer?
- White gown? What?

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.430
So, are you saying that the white gown serial killings have started again?

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:06.910
We're still investigating.

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:11.290
So then, you're saying that Kim Hyeong Bok, who was caught as the culprit, is not the perpetrator?

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:15.060
Isn't it true, then, that you made a random person into a perpetrator so you could close the case?

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:19.730
If that's true, this means that you deceived the nation. Is that what you're saying?

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:25.210
The place where the body was found is the exact same place as the fourth murder.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.310
We need to investigate further,

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:31.050
but this kind of situation has never happened in a serial murder case before.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.320
In my personal opinion,

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.490
I think it's a different perpetrator than in the last murders.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:40.510
Then, are you saying this case is separate from the White Gown case?

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:42.480
There's a big possibility

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.800
that the perpetrator is a person

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.130
who is copying the White Gown serial killer.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:50.430
A copycat?

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:02.630
She hasn't come home yet, and her phone is off too.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:08.410
I checked the photo, and it's almost an exact match to the victim's face we saw at the scene.

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:09.580
It's her.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.280
Did you check the security cameras nearby?

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.070
There are none here.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.990
This is the victim leaving the campus at around 17:00 (5:00 pm).

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.020
And her leaving a café near the school at around 19:00 (7:00 pm).

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.940
And...

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:39.040
she got on the bus around 19:30 (7:30 pm),

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:44.610
and around 20:00 (8:00pm), she was filmed arriving at the bus stop near her home and getting off.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:46.440
No footage from near the bus stop?

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.290
We checked with the district office's situation room, but they said there are no CCTVs there.

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.510
At all the presumed abduction sites of the victims of the murders that have occurred

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.550
there aren't any security cameras.

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.030
It means that the culprit committed the crime after checking everything in advance.

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:01.680
Anyway, doesn't that mean that the crime took place between the house and the bus stop?

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.770
Then, don't you think it might have been caught on the dashcams of parked cars there?

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:07.260
There weren't many cars because it's a narrow street.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.300
They probably kept even that in mind.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.630
Then...

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:14.950
this is as far as we can go.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:19.990
[Kwon Jae Hong]

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.830
Let's take just one more step further from here.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.250
You said Seongwol-dong, right?

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.600
Yes. Around 20:00 (8:00 pm).

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:41.500
Yes, we have it. Seongwol-dong, Daeju St 13-4, 19:20 (7:20 pm).

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.480
Seongwol-dong, Daeju St 25-1, 20:10 (8:10 pm).

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.250
There are those two.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.190
There's nothing, even though we kept rewinding it.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.690
This is the 20:10 (8:10 pm) one, right?

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:59.660
Yes. It was 20:05 (8:05 pm) when the victim got off the bus,

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.600
so it should've been caught on this if it was caught at all.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.580
Let's check the 19:20 (7:20 pm) one too.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.770
Don't you think the time gap is too big?

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:11.560
Let's check, just in case.

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.550
Okay.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.720
Wait. Back. Can you go back?

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.440
Right here.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.200
There wasn't anyone caught just now.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.410
Can you close up on this part?

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.890

What do you think? Can you smell the culprit?

I have to catch him with my own hands.

If I don't, I'll be embarrassed as a detective for the rest of my life.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.020
You two, you learned something on the crime scene that day, didn't you?

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.340
Someone who's not on people's minds even if they're on the bus' security camera all day long.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.400
Who was the driver of that bus?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.130
Stop the bus now!

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.730
It's about time for a change. Time to shuffle the business team of TJ.

Find out who that is.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.150
Isn't there a high possibility that it's a copycat crime?

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:30.160
I'm concerned that I'm making the wrong person the perpetrator.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.290
You made a mistake.
