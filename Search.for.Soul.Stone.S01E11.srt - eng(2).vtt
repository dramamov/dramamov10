00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.439
What if I insist on going in?

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:56.960
Alright.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.399
You can't win against them.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.920
Let Madam Tang come in.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.040
Sorry about this, Madam Tang.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:23.920
This outfit...

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.239
I'm not dressed to greet you.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.040
Would you like a drink?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.359
Where's Jia Yuer?

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:31.359
No idea.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.359
My niece...

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.400
She's not my responsibility.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.359
She and Meng Yan barged into our Tang family.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.000
They took Yu Yan away.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.159
What does that have to do with me?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.359
The younger generation's business...

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.480
I never interfere.

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.599
I suggest you do the same.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.599
At their age,

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.359
they're especially rebellious.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.920
Shen Tianyi has his eyes on Meng Yan.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.680
Aren't you worried they're with Meng Yan?

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.200
Of course I'm worried.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.599
How could I not be?

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.760
I think what Madam Tang fears most

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.439
is probably Shen Tianyi.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.199
Tell your daughter what happened back then.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.159
Speaking of that...

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.639
Jia family head, you must share my pain.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.759
Aren't you afraid of Jia Yuer?

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.840
What should I be afraid of?

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.680
Six years ago,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.400
I wasn't even in Myanmar.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.599
All those dirty things my brother did...

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.439
What do they have to do with me?

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.120
That's true.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.319
But if your niece finds out,

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.000
will she trust her playboy uncle

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.120
and believe what you say?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.759
If Meng Yan finds out

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.240
what your brother did back then,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.800
can he forgive Jia Yuer?

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.879
What exactly do you want?

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm going to find Shen Tianyi.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.479
Take care of yourself.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.719
Why are you looking for him?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.080
To beg him.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.479
In these Shen family files,

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.319
there's no info on the Gifted.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.719
Why don't you pull that cloth aside and look?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.000
Oh.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.159
These are all from the past few years,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.759
the Shen family info we've found.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.360
By the way...

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.599
What exactly is Shen Tianyi's gift?

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.599
No one knows what Shen Tianyi's gift

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.680
actually is.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.680
We only know he's extremely powerful.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.639
My mom once said

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.599
even if she gave it her all,

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.599
she could only fight Shen Tianyi to a draw.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.159
And it's strange...

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.400
Shen Tianyi's appearance—

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.400
I've seen him since I was a child,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.599
and he hasn't changed at all.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.879
He should be,

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.719
by now, over sixty.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.360
No matter how young he looks,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.400
he should at least have some gray hair.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.159
But now he looks

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.560
like he's just in his forties.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800
I've seen him since I was little,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.759
and his looks truly haven't changed.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400
It's really bizarre.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
And look at this—

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.519
This address left by Shen Jingshi

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.240
belongs to a Shen family Jadeite Factory.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
The location...

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:23.879
is right here.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.279
Every day, jadeite rough stones from the mine

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.680
are shipped here.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.480
And it's also equipped with

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.000
a jadeite exhibition hall.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.800
This place is crucial to the Shen family.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:33.720
So I suspect

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.120
there must be guards stationed here.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:37.519
Maybe even the Gifted.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.240
Getting inside

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.480
won't be easy.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.800
Transporting these rough stones

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.720
must rely on big trucks.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.600
Then we could hide in a truck

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.680
and sneak in.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.759
Exactly.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.680
So...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.079
Let's go now.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.000
Even if we can't get in,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.120
we'll at least scout it out.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.399
Alright.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.639
Wait a second.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.319
So...

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.160
What about Xiao Duo?

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.519
This is too dangerous.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:18.759
Xiao Duo definitely can't go.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.399
Let's wait until she's asleep.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.160
Wait for her to fall asleep...

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.399
Mm-hmm.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.399
When will she ever fall asleep?

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.399
Just wait.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.040
If she doesn't finish her movie,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.480
she won't sleep.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.600
No, wait—

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:49.800
The jadeite owner's delivery time

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.480
is only from 11 to 1 a.m.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.120
We're running out of time.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:53.800
I don't care.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.040
Within one hour,

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.959
make her sleep.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.839
I...

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.959
Can't you just

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.680
use your power to make her sleep?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.480
I can't.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.480
At a time like this,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.759
I still have to save someone.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.480
Now's not the time for details.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.399
It's just making her sleep,

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.720
not hurting her.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:12.959
It's not that I don't want to.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:13.279
It's...

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.639
I just can't do it.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.920
I've told you before,

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.720
Xiao Duo's situation is very strange.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.560
With the Gifted,

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.800
when I try to control their mind,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.279
I feel a strong resistance.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.160
But with Xiao Duo,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.399
I don't feel any of that.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.800
I can only read what she wants to tell me.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.319
But I...

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.680
can't control her mind.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.319
Can't even read her heart.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.199
It's like...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.279
reaching your hand into water,

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.439
and trying to grab something.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.319
Gentle Mom is online now!

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.319
Hey, Fourth.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.600
Why are you so late?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.120
Sister Xiaoduo is telling you—

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.079
Kids really should go to bed early.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.399
But he can help me make money.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.879
So, what do you think?

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.480
You're getting senile.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.079
Who do you think you are?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.959
You dare set up a stall here?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.800
Don't think that just because you're—

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.399
Kids really should sleep early.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.600
Otherwise, your health will—

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.959
That's a total jerk move.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.360
You know that?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.519
And you said you wanted to be loud.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.480
I swear I'll smack you, believe it?

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.720
A gentle mom.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.199
What do you mean?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.079
I'm not gentle enough?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.759
Meng Xiaoduo just can't speak.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:47.319
She's not stupid.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.120
She can tell if you're real or faking.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.480
Was I faking it?

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.120
Fine.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.680
I want to see how much better Tang Yuyan is than me.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.800
How long does it take her to get Xiaoduo to sleep?

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:05.519
Shh.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.199
She's asleep.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:14.879
How did you do that?

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.040
Maybe—

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.600
I'm just gentler, I guess.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.680
The raw stones they sent—

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.199
Don't seem special at all.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.200
Meng Yan, can you sense any Soulstones inside?

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.480
Very faint.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.600
Almost none, really.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.000
Logically speaking—

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:42.559
The Shen family already controls—

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.799
all the jadeite mines.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.879
The raw stones they bring in—

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.000
should be carefully selected.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.720
Sending in such low-grade stones—

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.279
I don't know what they're for.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.399
It's late tonight.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.639
I went to the gas station earlier.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.200
Somehow, I fell asleep.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.200
Hello.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:22.200
The number you dialed can't be reached.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:24.159
What—

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.480
Any noise behind us?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.919
Didn't hear anything.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.240
No sound at all.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.759
Open it, let me see.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.720
I didn't hear anything either.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.919
Open it and check.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.360
I think you misheard.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.399
There's nothing here.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.000
Let them through.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.919
Such an important place—

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.399
We got in so easily.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.080
There's a power reading to the east.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.279
Shen Jingshi might be there.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.080
Let's go.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.519
Not just one.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600
There are three.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.519
Three?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.960
How is that possible?

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.120
The Gifted.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:09.480
Even for the Shen family—

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.279
that's rare.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.240
Just this factory—

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.399
has three of them?

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:16.519
Unless—

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.799
Shen Jingshi already knew we were coming.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.399
Keep a close eye on them.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:39.080
Report their positions to me at all times.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:39.919
Yes.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600
If they know, so be it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.759
Wipe them all out.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:49.600
You—

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.279
Are these three places far apart?

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.120
East, west, north.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:59.679
Three directions.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.399
Each is a bit far from the others.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.159
If we move together—

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.200
we could get surrounded.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.960
We might not get another chance.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.600
I think it's better if we split up.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.600
But splitting us up—

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.600
might be exactly what Shen Jingshi wants.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.000
No.

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:18.399
We absolutely can't—

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.639
repeat what happened with Jin Zhenghao.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.000
Lean your head over.

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:23.440
What for?

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:27.440
Close your eyes.
