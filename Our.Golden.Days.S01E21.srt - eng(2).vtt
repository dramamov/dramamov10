WEBVTT

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.330
I'm home.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.360
But someone's here.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Who?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.570
Mom, I'm home.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.580
Wait, Woo Jin.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.880
Woo Jin.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.180
Woo Jin.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.680
What are you doing here?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.420
It's Global Immersion Week, so I have the week off.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.590
I just missed home so much, I had to come back.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.290
I'll only be here for a week, Dad.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.730
Still, how could you fly back here without calling?

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.000
He wanted it to be a surprise.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
I get it. I was homesick when I was away too.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.370
You're homesick now, after spending the whole summer...

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.680
travelling in Africa?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.640
Hey, Woo Jin, why are you so tan?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.210
Are you sick?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.850
I got tanned travelling in Africa.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.220
I've been playing a lot of tennis too.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.220
How have you been, Yeong Ra?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.950
Good.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.890
Come on, have a seat.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.190
He should go upstairs and wash up first.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.730
You should feed him first. Even if he ate on the plane,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.930
he must be hungry by now.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.500
Are you hungry?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.100
No, the food I ate on the plane is still sitting with me.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.110
Oh, really? Then go ahead and shower first.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.480
Let's go upstairs.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.560
It's not like Woo Jin to surprise us.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.560
Seong Jae, have you been in touch with Woo Jin?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.860
We text now and then to check in, but we haven't had a long talk.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.500
Plus, the time difference is tricky.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.370
I need you to look out for him.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.870
When your mother joined us, she made our family feel complete.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.480
So I hate to see Woo Jin looking like an outsider.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.110
I will.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.250
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.650
What were you thinking,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.750
showing up like this out of the blue?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.090
I don't have much time left.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.190
Rather than die all alone,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.390
- shouldn't I tell them the truth? - What do you mean, die?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.930
Do you really think I'd just let you die?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.170
You're getting on a plane back to the US first thing tomorrow.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.770
But Dad will get suspicious.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.080
What was that?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.510
Sending your homesick son away immediately?

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650
That's not something Dad thinks you'd do.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.450
How dare you give up and despair all on your own?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.960
A liver for you...

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.290
I've secured one.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.930
What?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.370
How? I'm still way down the list.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.530
You don't need to know how.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.070
At my checkup two weeks ago,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.900
Dr. Jin said I still had a long wait.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.540
Just have breakfast tomorrow, then leave right away.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.240
I'll get you a hotel room downtown.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.140
Rest there. Don't come back until 11pm.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.610
Just say you're meeting your friends.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.680
And starting the morning after next, don't come down for breakfast.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.250
Just say you're sleeping in.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.020
You'll leave after three days. Think of an excuse for why.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.090
Can I really get the liver transplant?

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.460
When?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.000
Two months from now at the latest.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.600
I'll tell them you're resting, so don't come downstairs.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.470
First, take your medicine. Then shower and get to bed.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.050
Woo Jin just got in the shower.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280
Oh, he did?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.620
Then let's come back later, Yeong Ra.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.150
Just talk to him tomorrow.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.260
Woo Jin seemed really exhausted.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.990
Seong Jae, you came home early to get some rest.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.360
Yeong Ra, you have your exhibition to prepare for.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.360
Just because Woo Jin showed up,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.670
it doesn't mean he can disrupt everything.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.570
Okay.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.810
- Get some rest. - Okay.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
Go on in.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.210
Seong Jae.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.110
Yes?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.550
When you saw Woo Jin out front earlier,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.990
did he say anything?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.790
It's just a little strange.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.620
How could he come back to Korea without Mom knowing?

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.760
I'm sure he has his reasons.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
If I don't get to talk to Woo Jin today,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.570
should I try to talk to him tomorrow morning?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.170
Talk to him?

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.470
After what Dad said earlier...

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.780
But Woo Jin and I were never that close.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.580
What would I even say?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.950
I can't think of anything to say.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.320
Maybe it's because he's the only one with a different surname?

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.020
Or that he has a different dad?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.030
I'm going to head in.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
All right.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.780
I can't find it anywhere.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.810
I always put it back in my bag after I use it.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.320
Didn't you use your notebook when you saw Director Ko yesterday?

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.790
I didn't even have time to take out my notebook.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.950
There was that whole leak situation.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.590
You probably left it at home.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.460
Try to remember when you used it last.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.800
It's not at home, though.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.510
I took notes two days ago on a call with the Suri-dong lady.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.510
- Gosh, you scared me! - You scared me!

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.820
What are you doing in there? When did you get here?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220
Just now.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.360
I couldn't find one of my ties. I thought I might've left it here,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.690
but it's not here.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.290
Maybe it fell out when we moved our stuff?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.660
Hold on a second.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.100
How did the pitch go?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.000
And how are you feeling?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.340
You were worried about me?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.120
I guess you were worried about me.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.720
Of course, I was worried.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.220
You were at the hospital all night, then went straight to the pitch.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.360
So? Did it go well?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.060
Yes, it went perfectly.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.760
Maybe it was all thanks to...

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.530
the cheonggukjang and the deboned fish.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.140
But the pitch was this afternoon. What have you been doing since then?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.900
I had some work to finish up at the office.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.240
Are you crazy? You should go home and get some rest.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.910
What about you? Since you took me to the hospital,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.980
you didn't get any sleep.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.110
So why aren't you home? What are you still doing here?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.620
By the way...

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.290
You know you've been speaking informally to me, right?

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.760
Have I?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.160
Let's keep it professional. As CEO Lee and Manager Ji.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.260
I don't want to.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.830
- You don't want to? - Let's just drop it already.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.500
Is our relationship still so formal that we can't even speak casually?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.770
You've already called me your senior more than once.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.710
When did I ever do that?

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.510
In the ER, when the nurse asked, "Are you his guardian?"

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.540
You said, "He's my senior."

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.740
You should've said "business partner."

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.410
I don't remember that.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.550
See? That's my point.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.780
What slips out is how you really feel.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.660
You even used my name casually when you were talking to Su Jeong.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.760
I never said that.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.360
There's no way I did that, Mr. Lee.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.760
I heard you. Twice.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.630
It's not just because of Gang Oh.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.000
I realised Ji Hyuk is really sincere about this business.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.010
We have to reuse what we can. Ji Hyuk doesn't have a lot of money.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.550
Did I say that?

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.220
Without even realising it, you've accepted me as your senior.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.750
And I didn't even have to ask.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.820
But still...

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.630
And I know I'm only saying this now, but it's about time you forgave me.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.060
It's not like I committed some unforgivable crime against you.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.070
Anyway, the point is,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.300
I'm going to start talking casually again...

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.470
and call you Eun Oh, like I used to.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.540
I don't care what you say.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.840
- What? You can't just decide that. - Hold on. My gosh...

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840
Oh, no.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.650
I'm the one who was just rushed to the ER early this morning.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.050
I should go home and rest. You should hurry home and rest too.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.890
Hey...

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.420
Unbelievable.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.430
You two seem awfully comfortable together.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.960
- What are you talking about? - You two! My goodness.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.570
What happened to the tense Ji Eun Oh and the flustered Ji Hyuk?

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.670
It's like you two are right back to your old selves.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.110
- No, it's not like that, Su Jeong. - What do you mean it's not?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.740
No, that's not it. Just hear me out.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.110
What's that look on your face? Come here.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.570
(My Wife Kim Da Jeong)

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.000
You should call it a night. Come on in and eat.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.900
I'm sleepy and want to turn in.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.210
Wait, what are you doing coming out of there?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.980
None of your business.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.650
Hey, you look awful.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.220
You're running a business but still can't make enough to eat?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.190
You're nothing but skin and bones.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.960
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.530
That's what you get for overreaching, you fool.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.770
Ji Hyuk, perfect timing. I'm so tired today.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.770
I dreaded making dinner twice.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.810
Why? Mom, are you not feeling well?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.640
No, it's nothing.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.210
Then, you two go ahead and eat.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.080
I'm going to go lie down.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.790
Why bother making a meal for a son who can't even come home on time?

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.260
It'd be a different story if it were for her husband.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.090
Could Mom be going through menopause?

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.560
She's seemed so tired lately.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.900
It's been nice and quiet these past few months.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.130
But of course, she'd be worn out with a freeloader in the house.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.370
Oh, boy. Mom refuses to take money for our living expenses.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440
And I'm worried.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.440
She's my wife. She listens to me. Why would she listen to you?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.540
I'll give Mom some spending money on the side.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.750
These days, many reckless youngsters want to throw cash around,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.950
even though it's clear they started their business...

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.720
with someone else's money.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.960
Why do people think they know it all when they don't have a clue?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.760
Try lasting 30 years in the working world.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.360
If running a business were so easy, who would bother with a 9-to-5?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.030
Just all flash and no substance.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.540
Mom's cooking is seriously the best.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.910
So good.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.550
They're actually talking without raising their voices.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.280
But I wonder what they're saying.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.130
Wait.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.690
Father, I'll do it.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.470
My gosh.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.970
Now, I can finally eat in peace.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.550
Where's the manager?

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.120
She's outside on a call.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.120
All right, I'll see you tomorrow then.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.450
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.430
It's finally taken off and is doing well now.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.840
But do you ever see Ji Hye's son? He has no reason to come by, right?

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.440
Seong Jae? I've seen him a few times.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.180
Yes, a situation came up.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.480
But why are you suddenly asking about Ji Hye's son?

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.020
Because Ji Hye was asking about him.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.450
I hear he turned out well.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.920
But you can tell he was motherless. There's an emptiness, a shadow.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.560
Gosh, that Ji Hye, she's a real piece of work.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.090
Every time I see Seong Jae, I'm the one who feels terrible.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.270
She left him at four and disappeared.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.570
Do you think he even remembers her?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.470
Do you think he believes his stepmom is his real mom?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.510
That's right, four years old.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.850
How could Ji Hye abandon her own son for another man?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.360
I guess being rich isn't everything.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.160
What good is being rich if you grow up without a mom?

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.260
Gosh, that's just awful.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.730
I could never live like that.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.970
I feel so bad for Seong Jae.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.210
Get a grip, Lee Su Bin.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.610
Is this really the time to be worrying about Seong Jae?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.250
What are you worried about him for?

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.980
He's sweet and good-looking. He turned out fine.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.290
You need to figure out your own life.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.990
What?

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.900
This is the only one you have?

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.700
Is this the last one?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.610
We only carry vintage items here. So each piece is one-of-a-kind.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.040
So it's vintage.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.580
Would you like to try it on?

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.850
Yes, please.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.220
Wow, it's so unique and pretty.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.060
That retro style looks amazing on you.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.670
I know, right? It's a one-of-a-kind design.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.970
Is everything okay with Woo Jin?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.680
Are you hiding something from me?

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.850
What could be wrong with Woo Jin? He'd tell us if he got a girlfriend.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.360
Woo Jin still seems so uncomfortable around me.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.930
I've really been trying, you know.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.960
Maybe it's because we've been apart since he started school abroad.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.000
Or that we only texted to check in because of the time difference?

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.540
You're not exactly the easiest father to talk to.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.540
It wasn't like that with Seong Jae.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.580
Seong Jae was like that with me too.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.610
And now that I think of it, Yeong Ra has never been needy either.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.120
You've always been an imposing figure as a father.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.490
Of course, they're intimidated. It's only natural.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.580
Man.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.010
Father.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.350
I guess he didn't hear me.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.630
Good grief, that kid is so skinny, a strong wind could blow him over.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.930
Just drifting through life, that kid.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.370
What's so urgent he has to leave at the crack of dawn?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.170
Goodness. That kid's all talk.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.210
Oh, boy.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.840
I can do this.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.710
I can do this. I can.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.480
Morning, Woo Jin. Did you sleep well?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.850
I bet the jet lag kept you up.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.820
And he's still heading out as soon as he's done with breakfast.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.960
What? Where to?

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.530
To see his friends, of course.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.830
I'm going to give him a ride on my way to work.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.000
So I guess we won't see much of you tonight either.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300
Sorry, Seong Jae.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.640
Have fun, Woo Jin.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.510
Yes.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.050
Here.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.780
Have some real fun while you're here.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.180
Blow off some steam and relax.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760
Thank you.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.310
- I'm sorry for being reckless... - Shut your mouth.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240
Get out.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.330
Now. Let's have it.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.460
Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.230
I didn't sleep a wink last night. I was so worried we'd get caught.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.500
Or what if they started to suspect something?

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.270
I felt hopeless.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.710
I was taking diuretics for the fluid build up,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.010
stuck up in the mountains,

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.580
thinking I'd die before it was my turn for the transplant.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.720
And I felt so alone.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.150
I figured they'd find out eventually once I had the surgery.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.420
So if you have the surgery,

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.130
you think your father, Seong Jae, and Yeong Ra are all going to visit?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.690
Is that what you thought would happen?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
Wouldn't they?

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.770
Han Woo Jin.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.110
Do you want to die? Or do you want to live?

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.140
Do you want to stay in that house and still be part of the family?

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.710
Yes.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.520
A son who needed a liver transplant...

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.660
Park Jin Seok will never see you as a potential heir.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.490
Why do you think...

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.630
I've hidden you away at the hospital and in the mountains?

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.930
You're unacceptable with a flaw like that.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.870
You have to be flawless.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.610
You can't appear inferior to Park Seong Jae in any way.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.880
That's why you must study abroad...

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.850
and return as a healthy, vibrant son to join your father's company.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.350
You have to quietly work your way in and replace...

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.250
the unambitious Seong Jae.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.320
To raise you to be this qualified...

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.960
With sports, art, and secret tutors...

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.790
Don't you know how hard I worked?

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.760
I know!

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.600
- But that's not what I... - No, Han Woo Jin!

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.300
This "But I..."

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.400
You don't get to do that!

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.140
Just because you have your own mind, that doesn't mean it's yours.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.210
Who do you think made you who you are today?

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.580
It was me. Your mother.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.190
If I hadn't remarried Chairman Park, you'd be living a pathetic life.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.420
I know that.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.120
If it weren't for me,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.730
you'd have never gotten into college.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.100
The moment your father died, we were stripped of everything...

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.670
and thrown out in midwinter! You would've frozen or starved!

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.110
I'm the one who gave you this life. Every last bit of it.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.580
So you will do as I say.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.280
That's the entire reason I raised you.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.110
Your life isn't your own!

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280
Am I wrong?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.620
You think it's unfair?

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.230
To save your life,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.960
to get you that liver transplant,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.570
do you know how hard I had to fight?

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.500
You're going to live, Woo Jin.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.340
Once you fully recover,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.680
it'll be like walking through an unguarded castle gate.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.950
As for Park Seong Jae,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.920
he's a total pushover with no ambition or desire.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.530
(Startled)

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.130
(Tap, hugging)

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.230
So? What do you think?

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.070
This is great. It's so good. When these two get back together,

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.630
it really tugged at my heartstrings. I got choked up.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.640
Really? I thought we wrote it together.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.080
You bring the story to life. That's the artist in you, Yeong Ra.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.580
The artist in me?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.610
Right, webtoon creators are called artists too.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.880
By the way, once this exhibition is over,

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.550
what's next for you?

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.790
Will you keep coming here to paint?

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.890
I don't know.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.390
I guess Mom will tell me what's next after my solo exhibition.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.230
I have a feeling once it's done, I'm out too.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.230
Right?

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.440
It's possible.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.810
But you know I'm never sure about anything, right?

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.250
That's true.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.380
You are the girl who lives by her mother's plan, after all.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.520
Right, Yeong Ra.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.630
Let me move those paintings for you. I was my friends' go-to mover.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.860
No, it's fine.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.060
My mom already hired a special truck and professional art handlers.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.330
There are even professionals for moving paintings?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.570
You people really live in a different world.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.280
With the showroom, Mamdaerozip's growth...

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.180
- and profit margin look promising. - Yes, thank you.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.550
Right.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.880
Thank you for your time.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.390
When you're done with the meeting, come to my office.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.920
We need to talk business.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.030
(Shoealls)

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.930
Should I treat you as a friend or as my prospective investor?

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.240
Drop the "prospective." Just "investor."

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.770
What? You already decided?

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.840
I call the shots now.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.080
It's a loan investment. The terms and details are all there.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.380
Read it over and sign.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.880
(Next Labs and Mamdaerozip, Investment Agreement)

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.520
"Next Labs"?

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.290
I started my own investment firm.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.560
- You weren't just playing around. - Of course not.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.930
What kind of lunatic plays around with three million dollars?

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.060
Three million?

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.830
Isn't that a little too generous?

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.100
I'm not investing in this because we're friends.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.400
Your proposal convinced me.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.600
You got me to join Sunny Investment Association,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.370
so I invested in two startups.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.210
One of them is struggling a bit,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.910
but the other one is growing pretty fast.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.050
This is a loan, not for equity. You're cutting me too much slack.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.790
I have to cut you some slack on that.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.090
We're besties, after all.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.090
I come from a family of businesspeople.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.060
Trust me. Not losing money is in my blood.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.640
I know. My proposal would make anyone want to invest.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.000
Stop with the false modesty, then.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.740
All right.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.880
Thanks. Let's talk more at Cafe Agit later.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.560
(CH Cheonghwa Bank)

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.130
(Park Seong Jae has transferred 3 million dollars.)

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.600
Park Seong Jae, this crazy punk.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.030
He sent the three million already?

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300
All right then.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.110
(Team Leader Kang Dong Hoon)

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.210
Yes, this is Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.380
Start prepping for version 2.0.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.420
We're signing the contract tomorrow. Yes!

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.150
Where's Eun Oh?

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.890
She's in a meeting with the turnkey designer.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.260
Why are the kitchen counter-tops still...

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.530
- Is it the Mangin-dong project? - And the cabinet doors are painted.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.700
The bathroom threshold could rot over time,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.170
so I asked you to replace it with artificial marble.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.940
I convinced the client to go with ceramic.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.080
If we used marble for the threshold, the colours wouldn't match,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.980
so I just left it as is.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.680
But we went way over the client's budget.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.890
It doesn't have to be ceramic. Matching colours still look sleek.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.360
And a film wrap on the cabinet doors would've lowered the cost.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.360
Getting clients to spend more money...

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.160
is also part of a designer's skill set.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.730
Then what about the bathroom threshold?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.600
That was about professional pride. I majored in interior design,

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.800
and I have nine years of experience.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.270
And I'm the head of the turnkey team.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.710
With only two years of experience, I hear.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.610
So what?

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.650
Are you pulling rank on your manager with your experience, Ms. Lee Ri Na?

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.890
As I see it, Ms. Ji wasn't wrong about a single thing.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.690
No, that's not what I meant...

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.130
I personally scouted Ms. Ji to be my team leader,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.100
and if she doesn't approve it, construction doesn't start.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.430
If you're going to treat her this way, you can quit now.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
No, sir. I'll make the revisions.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.540
What's your call?

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.310
Revise it and email it to me by tonight.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.120
Understood.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.390
Unbelievable.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.030
You didn't have to embarrass her like that.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.200
I was talking about you.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.130
Excuse me?

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.270
You have no problem being harsh and snapping at some people.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.770
Why didn't you tell her to fix it immediately?

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.310
It was her first time.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.650
As if I got a do-over.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.890
Just do your job right.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.650
Act like a team leader.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.920
Gosh, you're giving me an earful.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.890
If you have work to do, go and do your work.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.460
Work? Right, why did I come here again?

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:23.930
Right. Coffee.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.600
I came to get some coffee.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.670
Let me get 3 iced Americanos and 3 slices of cake.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.010
You have to order at the counter.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.780
You're still the manager. Come on, just get it for me.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.910
Hurry up.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.360
It was right here? Seriously, how did I miss this?

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.810
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.340
We have to appeal to a younger audience.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.050
Should I ask Su Bin?

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.280
Well, then just say you're quitting to go full-time on YouTube.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.720
Problem solved, right?

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.190
Seong Jae, I took your advice and asked Shin Woo Yeong to meet.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:23.960
That's right.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.660
I wonder how that turned out.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.400
(Lee Su Bin)

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.470
Hey, Seong Jae, I'm filming right now.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.710
Su Bin. How did it go with that guy?

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.810
Did it go well?

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.040
He was up for it, but I turned him down.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.480
Turns out, he was a total airhead.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.650
He said you could just do YouTube, and you still turned him down?

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.410
I can't talk more. I'm busy.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.620
Su Bin. Then after your shoot, come by the office.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.550
Okay.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.460
Su Bin sounds excited.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.200
(Cafe Agit, Closed)

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.110
Goodbye, Cafe Agit.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.480
I'm about to cry.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.210
Come on. But you kept all these reminders.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.650
But you're leaving.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.450
Hey, I'll be back for the opening. That's why I'm going to Chiang Mai.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.620
I'm skipping Europe for this.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.730
What are you two up to?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.830
You're clearing out the cafe.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.030
Goodbye, Cafe Agit!

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.310
What will you do now, Director? Your watering hole is closing.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.320
I have a new watering hole. I'm an investor in this new office.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.120
An investor?

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.990
You invested in it?

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.890
You're such a loyal friend, Director.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.990
It's not just because we're friends. I've invested in a few startups.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.130
Wow, you have, Director?

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.930
Hey, why are you so surprised?

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.100
Are you worried about Seong Jae's investment?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.670
Of course, I'm worried.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.840
Hold on a second.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.340
So, Ji Hyuk is dropping the formalities?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.680
Yes. We're back to the senior-junior relationship.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.850
When did I agree to that?

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.080
See? There she goes again. She's the one who started it.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.250
- I did not... - Anyway,

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.950
that's what I've decided. No matter what Eun Oh says.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.520
Look, whoever wants to call me CEO Lee Ji Hyuk can do that,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.560
but to me, there's no Manager Eun Oh.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.330
Not when we're off the clock.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.130
He's just so impossible.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.240
Come on. Oh, hold on.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.700
(Team Leader Kang Dong Hoon)

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.970
It's the app development team. One second! Sorry.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040
Sure.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.680
By the way, Eun Oh,

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.550
how did you end up deciding...

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.120
to keep sharing a space with Ji Hyuk?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.490
Are you more comfortable with him now?

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.850
Maybe you hate him a little less?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.120
Even if we stop being partners, I can just block off the front...

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.760
and use the back door as an entrance to my own office.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.400
I needed my own office space anyway.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.100
It's natural for the hate and disappointment to fade.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.970
The fact that Ji Hyuk chose to get married like that...

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.140
was a little disappointing, but not enough to hate him forever.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.710
Right, Eun Oh?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.110
There was more to it than that.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.480
What do you mean, "more to it?"

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.550
Did something else happen?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.420
So, you didn't tell me everything, did you?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.720
No.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.490
Sorry.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.130
Ji Hyuk, are you throwing an opening party?

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.430
Yes, I guess I'll have to.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.570
What about your family? You should invite your parents too.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.770
Yes.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.580
I should. Maybe once construction starts?

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.380
You want me to give Ji Hyuk money?

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.180
He might not even be able to afford meals.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.280
No way.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.220
Ji Hyuk said he'd pay our expenses. So his business must be doing okay.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.260
How could he be making money when he just started?

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:22.730
I don't know what he's up to, but he must be using his investment.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.700
That's a man's pride for you.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.200
Because I've been giving him a hard time.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.670
So you admit you're giving him a hard time.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.810
Of course, I know.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.640
I'm only like this because he's the one being so stubborn.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.610
Then why are you telling me to give him money?

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.680
How much should I send?

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.890
That kid is so skinny, a strong wind could blow him over.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.260
What's so urgent he has to leave at the crack of dawn?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.100
Send him 10,000 dollars for operating costs.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.770
And don't expect to get it back.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.370
Ten thousand dollars?

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.440
Whether a startup or small business, ninety percent of them fail.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.610
Don't get your hopes up.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.580
So many memories are flooding back.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.620
The place's purpose may be changing, but we're all still here,

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.090
and I find that comforting.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.060
What about you, Ji Hyuk?

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.060
Me? Well...

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.430
I've just got to hit the ground running.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.100
And you, Eun Oh?

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:36.670
Well...

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:41.910
This place is in the past now. All I care about is the remodelling.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.010
Anyway, shouldn't we call it a night?

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.650
When there's work to do, you're all business, Eun Oh.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.760
Why?

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.400
No. It's just...

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.670
Call a designated driver.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.840
You take Eun Oh home.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.640
Should I?

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.940
No, it's okay. I can go home on my own.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.680
Seong Jae, you're not answering, and you weren't at the office.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.220
Right.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.220
Su Bin. Then after your shoot, come by the office.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320
Why?

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:33.360
Hey, I have to go.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.000
Something urgent came up. Sorry about this, Eun Oh.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.800
Don't worry about it.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.100
What's the emergency?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600
I'll see you later.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.070
Sorry, everyone.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.880
- Su Bin. - Hey.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.020
Hey, sorry about that.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.250
But what is all this?

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.290
- Clothes. I said I had a shoot. - Clothes?

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.960
Why are there so many?

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.530
These all look like old clothes.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.170
- They're not old. They're vintage. - Vintage?

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.870
Right. Hey, tell me more. Why don't you want to date him?

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.070
He said he was fine with you quitting your job to do YouTube.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.380
Wasn't he a perfect match for what you want in a marriage?

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.180
From his looks to everything else, he seemed perfect...

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.580
until he opened his mouth. He was awful.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.320
He said he'd buy me designer stuff...

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.990
and told me to change my content, like he was my sugar daddy.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.890
Designer goods?

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.960
- Isn't that what you've wanted? - Seong Jae!

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.930
I told you. I'm not just looking for a rich guy.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.300
A guy who's also rich. And not to get married right away.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:46.570
I told you I wanted to date first.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.070
I wasn't looking for a guy...

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.840
who'd use his money to boss me around and control me.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.740
You really mean that?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.840
What do you take me for?

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.010
I may have wanted to move up in the world,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.280
but not by losing myself. Absolutely not.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.690
- You sure you won't regret this? - I won't.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.690
I'm done with the matchmaking agency.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.060
I realised I need to work on myself first.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.500
I'm going to focus on my YouTube channel.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.270
So I've decided to change my concept to retro vintage.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.200
You said it yourself, right? That my content was too generic.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.110
I went to Dongmyo Market today, and it was absolutely amazing.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.510
There were just rows and rows of thrift shops.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.350
They had clothes for under a buck. So I bought outfits for all seasons.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.120
Look at you, all excited.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.920
Yes, so to celebrate my new concept, I've been vlogging all day.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.290
So I guess you won't need to work at the shop anymore, then.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:46.830
What?

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.830
Right, I guess not.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.670
But I should stay until they hire my replacement.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.100
All right.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.540
I'll send a replacement over right away.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.310
Seong Jae...

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.170
I really was grateful for everything.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.080
But it feels like all my effort was for nothing.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.580
No, scratch that.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.920
You did the right thing. You really did.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.450
What?

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.250
Those rich, empty-headed jerks...

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.060
Frankly, I thought you were too good for them.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.330
Plus, I was a little scared Ji Hyuk would kill me.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:23.900
How could Ji Hye abandon her own son for another man?

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.530
Wait, did he know about that?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.670
I wonder how he must have felt.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.510
What is it?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.080
How old were you when your first memory happened?

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.680
For me, my very 1st memory is my 1st day of kindergarten.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:41.950
I was six.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.450
Pretty late, right?

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:45.890
I don't know.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.190
It's just a fragment of a memory.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.090
What was it?

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.960
Why are you asking something like that?

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.400
No, it's for a line in my YouTube video.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.100
So, how old were you when you had your first memory?

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900
Four.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.670
Hurry up and get out!

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.480
Please, just take Seong Jae with you.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.980
Your mom's running off with another man...

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.350
and abandoning you...

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480
Seong Jae.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.690
I'm so sorry.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.460
I'm sorry.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.370
I'm so sorry.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.650
You don't remember?

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.190
It's just a spam text.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.900
So what happened when you were four?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.070
It wasn't anything memorable.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
What's going on?

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.500
Why are you so quiet?

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.900
I'm just letting you rest.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.310
What is with you?

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.450
It's creepy when you're this quiet.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.990
You're like a ghost.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.230
You just confirmed I'm not a ghost, right?

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.300
What? That doesn't mean you can just suddenly...

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.580
You should be thankful I'm keeping my mouth shut.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.430
Go on in.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:46.970
Thanks for...

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.010
Let's go.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.810
What? He's so hot and cold.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.680
I can never figure that guy out.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.460
Woo Jin.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960
Hey.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.500
I was hoping to grab lunch tomorrow. Are you free?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.630
Tomorrow?

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.970
Don't even think about meeting Seong Jae or Yeong Ra alone.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.640
Oh, man. I'm booked solid all day.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.810
Right. I'm sure you are.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.050
Of course, you would be, since your trip got moved up.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.620
Get some rest.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.250
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.690
Yes?

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.690
I'm sorry.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.730
Don't be silly.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.570
Grandma.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.010
Grandma, were you sleeping?

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.520
The light was on, so I didn't know. Could I leave these here for a bit?

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.960
My goodness, what is all this?

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.260
They're clothes for a shoot, but they're too heavy to carry up.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.930
I'm just going to leave these in your room for now.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.630
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.900
Oh, no! What am I going to do?

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240
Yes.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.040
Too bad you'll miss Yeong Ra's show before you go.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.650
I'm sorry.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.220
My professor scheduled an internship interview,

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.050
not knowing I'd be in Korea.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.590
I know.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.490
Woo Jin, you have to come back for winter break.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.390
Don't go travelling anywhere else first.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.430
I will.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.230
Thank you.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:56.730
I'm off.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.830
- See you later. - Yes.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.340
Your flight is at noon, right?

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:09.010
I'll give you a ride.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.180
No, I'll be the one to take him.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.380
He's been so busy with his friends, I've barely had an hour with him.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.390
At least I'll get to see him on the way to the airport.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.550
Of course.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520
Have a safe flight.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360
I'll get going, then.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.390
Make sure he gets inside safely.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.820
Mom.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.030
You're just going to leave?

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.430
I have a lot to do.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.570
Okay.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.710
Again, we are very sorry.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.820
We'll follow your instructions carefully.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.290
His meals, his medication...

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.350
- Make sure he gets them on time. - Yes, ma'am.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.240
This is just bizarre.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.940
No, I'm positive I put it in here with the other documents.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.610
The partnership agreement is here, but where's the notarized document?

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.960
I guess I didn't throw this out.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.900
- Are you all packed? - Yes, almost.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.630
(Partnership Agreement)

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.230
I got this table and these chairs.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.000
I'll move these boxes too.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.510
Okay. I put stickers on what we're keeping,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.970
and Su Jeong sold most of the stuff we don't need.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.880
- Got it. - Hey...

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.940
What?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:26.910
By any chance...

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.190
Did you happen to see...

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.720
See what?

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.090
Never mind.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.430
Okay.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.670
Where could it have gone?

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.940
Manager.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.070
Lee Su Bin can stop working now,

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:54.280
so request a full-time intern.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.510
- As soon as possible. - But it hasn't even been a month.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:45:59.880
Understood, Director.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.380
I'll take care of it.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.970
(Jung Hyeon Su has sent a payment of 1,000 dollars.)

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.910
My last paycheck as the cafe manager.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.930
(October Household Budget)

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.460
(August Household Budget)

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.100
(Expense: Gang Oh 100 dollars)

00:46:58.810 --> 00:46:59.810
You got paid, right?

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.140
Let me get 100 dollars.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.740
You keep better track of my payday than I do.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.510
Mom's working me hard for peanuts. Of course, I'm short on cash.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.790
I wonder how much he's making there.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120
Then again,

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.760
how is he managing to stick it out for this long?

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.240
I sold the blender, the last item to get rid of!

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.880
Oh, right. You wanted all the sold items in a spreadsheet.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.180
Yes. When I give the money to Hyeon Su,

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.350
I want to give her the breakdown too.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.450
And Su Jeong, I'm going to head out now.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:47.090
Where to?

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.220
To see Gang Oh.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.660
I just want to pop in and see him before the construction starts.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:57.300
(Couples' Bar)

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.100
I can't believe he's still at it.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.750
Hey, Gang Oh.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.150
Move all that back to the kitchen's rear entrance.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.590
You want me to move all those back again?

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.560
- Why? - The pickup truck had an accident.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.830
What, then? Should we just leave them there?

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.160
You guys help me move them.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.530
Help you? Do it yourself.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.370
You guys have just been sitting around inside!

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.600
Hey! We're the owners,

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:40.040
and you're the part-timer. Got it? Part-timer.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.880
Now, move them, you punk.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.950
This is ridiculous.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.750
I've been working nonstop all week, you jerk!

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:50.850
Ji Gang Oh.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.250
Put your fist down.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.490
You'll just have to pay for damages. What a waste of money.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.230
- Damages? - You're Kim Ho Yeong, right?

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.000
You were in the army with Gang Oh.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.330
You disloyal, shameless punk.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.800
Is my brother your slave?

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.140
He moved all those out there by himself,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.970
and now you're making him move them all back alone?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.680
- You've been pushing him around? - Yes.

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.980
So what if we have?

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.450
Right.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.050
Okay, then.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.280
So you admit to workplace harassment.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.250
That settles that. Ji Gang Oh, about your pay so far...

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.720
Pull up your bank records. Now.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.060
Did you get your overtime and holiday pay?

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.130
What about your insurance?

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060
I didn't get any of that.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:38.100
I'm filing a report with this proof. So figure something out, you jerks.

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.330
You're coming with me.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.310
Wait...

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.450
They didn't hit you too, did they?

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.620
Did you really have to stick it out while they were beating you?

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.930
Seeing how much you've been putting up with...

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.700
Ji Gang Oh, you're coming home.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
I'll move out.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:23.910
But Gang Oh...

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.710
If I move out of the house,

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:28.880
where am I supposed to live?

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.320
And I'll have to move everything by myself, right?

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.250
Since we're strangers now.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.090
Do you want my name removed from the family register?

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.670
Did you really think I was going to say that, you punk?

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.010
Don't you know me by now?

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.970
Why would I be the one to move out?

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.710
And leave our mom behind? And leave my little brother?

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:01.720
Eun Oh...

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.490
Let's go.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.990
Go pack your bag and come out.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.020
Okay.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:37.950
Welcome.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.340
What are you doing? You saw Mom.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440
Gang Oh.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440
Mom.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.520
I'm sorry.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:20.390
I was wrong.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.770
I'm so glad you're back. Okay?

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.410
It's good to have you home. It really is.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.520
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:57.030
- Mom, did you know I was coming? - What?

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.730
Then how did you have my favourite meat ready?

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.500
It's always in the fridge, you brat.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.510
Mom would've eaten it for every meal after it expired.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:08.380
She couldn't bear to throw it away.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.380
I've been craving this so much.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.720
I thought I'd never get to eat it again.

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.520
Don't cry. Just eat.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.020
Okay? You'll get an upset stomach.

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.590
Finish eating.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.390
Then go home, get cleaned up, and rest.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.630
Look at the state of you.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900
No.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.500
I'll stay and help, then we can go home together.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:35.440
What?

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.080
My, it looks so good.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:51.350
Mom, this is for you.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.890
Oh? Gang Oh, what's this?

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.190
I was on my feet all day, every day, so my heels got dry and callused.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.660
You bought this thinking of Mom?

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.900
I've used it myself. It works really well.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.530
You're going to make me cry.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.940
- Let me put it on for you. - What?

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:14.780
Okay.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.150
Oh, it's a foam.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.850
This must be easy to apply.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.490
Hey, me too. My feet get all itchy in the fall.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.560
Get out of here.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.360
- Fine, I'll do it myself. - Oh, my.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:34.590
How does it feel, Mom?

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.030
Oh? It feels really nice.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:39.930
It's so moisturizing.

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.040
And it's not greasy at all.

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:45.340
When you run out, I'll buy you more.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.440
Look at our Gang Oh, coming back all grown up.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.180
You're so sweet.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.440
Wait.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.350
It's still dark out.

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:31.180
It's demolition day, Mom. I'm off to buy snacks for the crew.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.350
So it's finally starting.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.790
- Gang Oh's here. You can sleep in. - Okay.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.860
All right?

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.010

(Bbangsilhan Bakery)

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.650
I'm sorry, we don't have bread like that.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.630
But when you opened the shop, you handed out bread to celebrate.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.230
You never run out of things to eat.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.830
Someone sent bread from a new bakery.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.230
They must know you well.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.230
Pick something out.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.510
They have bread shaped like a coal briquette?

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:27.940
- They're serious about marketing. - What?

Excuse me, I'm so sorry, but could you take these two out...

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.070
and put these two in the box instead?

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.910

We were all wondering if there was a super romantic story behind it,

- Welcome. - Congratulations.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:57.060
Thank you all for coming. Meet my husband and my son...

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:58.960
May I see your invitation, please?

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:05.230
The stalker might try to get in,

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:07.030
so check every invitation thoroughly.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.740
Too many guards at a private show would ruin the mood.

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:12.540
That's why I'm only trusting you.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.910
Understood. Please don't worry.

00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.580
It was my senior year of high school.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.360
One day, on my way to school, I saw a purple violet by our wall.

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.190
I began to draw the flower as it grew a little each day,

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.600
and though it was the same flower,

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.430
I felt different emotions every day.

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.100
Those emotions were quiet,

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.010
but the flower grew as an extension of my heart,

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.870
and its texture began to change.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:52.350
As I drew its lines and followed its changing form,

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:55.980
my heart was in a quiet turmoil.

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:01.490
The flower was simply there, blooming,

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.890
but in that flower,

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.160
I felt like I saw myself.

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.500
I'm surprised.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.930
Her work is so elegant and beautiful.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.270
She poured her all into her daughter.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.900
I guess the rumours were true.

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.470
She's beautiful.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.440
The meaning of a pink rose in the language of flowers...

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.410
is gratitude, happiness, and grace.

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:26.850
That's the meaning.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:30.250
I wondered what the inner world of a rose would be like,

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.020
and I began to imagine it.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.520
So that's why the title is "The Rose Within."

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.990
I get it now. I love that.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:40.430
Thank you.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:47.870
Hello.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.600
I'm Lee Sang Hoon, Vice President of Human Deep Bio.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.180
(Lee Sang Hoon, Vice President of Human Deep Bio)

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680
Hello.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.260
Excuse me, could I see your invitation, please?

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.960
Actually, something startled me when I was parking out front.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.130
There was a strange guy there. He was lurking, his hat pulled down.

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:22.540
Out front of the building?

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Hey!

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.410
Hey, stop right there!

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.480
So, are you enjoying the paintings?

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.190
They're absolutely wonderful.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.850
Thank you.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.330
- Vice President, care for a tour? - I'd like that.

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:46.690
Right this way.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.460
Park Yeong Ra.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.910
Let's not cause a scene. We can talk outside, Yeong Ra.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.060
And it's great that we have an heir.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.200
- I hear your father isn't well. - Oh, dear.

(Haeum Gallery)

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.370
Please, spare me. Please, I'm begging you.

(Our Golden Days)

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.220
You punk. After you ruined my daughter's life.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.990
- A passionate affair? - It's always the quiet ones.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.090
I refuse to be seen as that kind of father.

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:03.660
I refuse to live as a father who makes his children worry.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.600
I'm going to see this through to the end.

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:08.800
Ji Eun Oh, you messed with the wrong person.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.870
Losing my daughter tore my heart to pieces,

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.970
and now my son's suffering is ripping me apart.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:18.580
She's obviously here for you. So what's with you?

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.420
Because right now, it's you I like. I like you so much.
