00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.719
So you ordered Jo Seong Dae to kill Park Geon Ho, right?

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.846
It's time you admit it now.

00:00:15.846 --> 00:00:21.446
Stop pretending like you don't know. We got proof that you killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:25.844
You told Park Geon Ho to kill Lee Dae Cheol in prison,

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.370
but Park Geon Ho didn't listen,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.930
and instead, he claimed that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.629
So you got nervous and got Jo Seong Dae to kill him. Am I wrong?

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.245
Why are you looking for evidence now? You should've looked for it back then.

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:43.117
You and Nam Gook Hyeon worked together to set it up.

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:44.741
Set it up?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.149
Set it up.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.760
If that was true, you should've discovered that back then too.

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:55.952
And what about Park Geon Ho?

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:59.345
You guys are the ones who announced that he committed suicide.

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:03.994
Why are you bringing that back up when you've already made the announcement?

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:05.547
Even so, Nam Gook Hyeon was the one─

00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:07.788
Right, Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.238
Isn't he on the same police force as you?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.680
In the end, it means the police were incompetent and corrupt.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.419
And you guys are admitting that right now. Am I wrong?

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:26.428
You should admit that you conspired with Nam Gook Hyeon to set the case up.

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:32.103
Then we'll admit that the police were incompetent and corrupt.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.828
There's a way to make the police look stupid again. Do you want to know what that is?

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.312
Confess that you killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:48.062
The retrials are already over. So we can't lock you up with that.

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:54.470
That way you'll get to humiliate the police again.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.696
That doesn't sound bad. I'll think about it.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:06.331
Your arrest warrant wasn't issued for the murder of Yoon Ji Seon.

00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.243
It's for conspiring to kill Park Geon Ho.

00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:13.349
It pisses me off, but you'll only get punished for that charge. But that's the reality.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.897
If you realize that you've done wrong and admit to your crime,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.689
we'll stop here, too.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.090
So you'll stop here

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.450
if you get to reveal that Lee Dae Cheol was wrongfully executed?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.506
That's what you want, right?

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:32.510
You killed Yoon Ji Seon,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.885
and Lee Dae Cheol was executed in your place.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.318
As a fellow human, do you not even have the slightest bit of conscience?

00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:47.391
You don't believe that I killed Detective Jang, too, right?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.225
You think that someone else killed him, right?

00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:55.819
Then you can't blame everything on the guy who killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.210
The guy who murdered the detective also sent Lee Dae Cheol to his execution chair.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.294
Catch that guy and let me see him.

00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:09.085
Then I'll discuss things with him and think about what I should do.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.410
Damn it!

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.183
My lawyer is going to get mad at me for saying too much. Let's stop here.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.110
Wow.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.396
He's not going to serve that many years even if we lock him up.

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:32.555
And that bastard is never going to feel bad for what he did.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.810
He looks confident on the outside, but he's very nervous and scared on the inside.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.634
We need to know that.

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:47.341
He realized for the first time in his life that he might go to prison.

00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:52.965
That's what he's scared of. And that's why he met with Yoo Jeong Ryeol. To escape that fear.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.605
Yoo Jeong Ryeol.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:04:00.558
What if we end up having to release him again?

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:04.318
The lab sent the DNA results from the skeletal remains.

00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:05.350
What does it say?

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.300
It's Jo Seong Gi.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.480
He was a former cop, and they had his DNA, so it was easy to confirm it.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.850
[Violent Crime Division Team 2: Woo Bong Sik]

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.966
You know who Jo Seong Gi is, right?

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:24.590
Yes.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.829
Do you remember meeting him five years ago?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.583
It's been about five years.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.880
The skeletal remains were confirmed to be Jo Seong Gi.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.277
He is estimated to have been killed five years ago.

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:43.497
And the time he was reported missing matches the time when you met with him.

00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:45.294
So you think I'm a suspect.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:47.075
We have no other choice from our perspective,

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:51.294
since we think you were the last person to see him alive.

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:54.624
You know about our past, right?

00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:58.044
And you must know that I was looking for him.

00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:02.817
Under these circumstances, I must be the prime suspect. But it won't be easy.

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:06.289
It will be hard to interrogate me as a suspect with only circumstantial evidence.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.914
You're right.

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:13.229
You're the senior manager of Jeonghan Daily and your brother is the Minister of Justice, so the investigation won't be easy.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.975
I understand that the circumstances make it seem like

00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:19.532
I could've killed Jo Seong Gi for personal vengeance.

00:05:19.532 --> 00:05:23.513
But it's been five years, and all we have is skeletal remains.

00:05:23.513 --> 00:05:27.810
So it will be very difficult to find direct proof that I killed him.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.496
It means it will be hard to solve the case without the killer's confession.

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:36.990
Detective Jang was also murdered

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.710
around the same time and same place. You know that, right?

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.735
I... So you're considering that I could have also killed Detective Jang?

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:53.106
We haven't excluded the possibility that it could be a coincidence.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.189
According to Reporter Jin's article,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:01.654
the skeletal remains were found pretty far from where Detective Jang's body was found.

00:06:01.654 --> 00:06:05.917
If the murderer had killed both of them, why would he bury the bodies so far apart?

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:09.751
Wouldn't it be logical to bury them together?

00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:12.181
It would be logical to bury them together,

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:17.938
but if the killer was someone who had seen many murder scenes like we have,

00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:21.437
then he may have wanted to go against that logic.

00:06:21.437 --> 00:06:25.675
The killer burned the car that had evidence in it, and buried the body underneath the car.

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:31.707
We can conclude that he used the logic of police scene preservation.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.780
That's a plausible speculation, but it's not a confirmed fact.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.405
It seems like you'll have to put in a lot of work to turn that speculation into fact.

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:46.977
We'll stop here since we're only interviewing you as a witness today. So, thank you for your cooperation.

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:51.077
You can call me anytime if my testimony can help with the investigation.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.951
But please avoid publishing-deadline times. A senior manager needs to look through many articles.

00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:57.576
Then, I need to get going for a meeting.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.135
It seems... we need more manpower for this case.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.554
Yes, Chief. We'll be right there.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.953
Maybe I'll talk to the chief about it.

00:07:21.953 --> 00:07:23.398
Do you think he can help?

00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:26.088
It's better than working alone.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Come in!

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.498
Welcome.

00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:36.488
You haven't eaten yet, right? Let's eat together.

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:38.100
Have a seat.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.783
- Enjoy!
- Thanks.

00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:47.845
By the way, tell the chef to use some good meat for the fried pork. It tastes different than before.

00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:49.470
Okay!

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.657
You don't have to leave the office today, right? It doesn't matter if you do.

00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:58.331
We need to drink in our line of work. We can't do it sober.

00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:01.440
- Why are we drinking in your office?
- Is something up?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.334
Just take the plastic wraps off. Do I have to do that too?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.828
I got this as a bribe. It's good.

00:08:11.828 --> 00:08:15.057
It's strong enough to knock you out with one shot, but you come back quickly.

00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:17.008
Why did you accept that?

00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:20.788
This is the only thing I was able to save after you took everything!

00:08:20.788 --> 00:08:23.813
I should've taken out the alcohol before returning everything.

00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:27.527
It would've been fun to open one at a time while I rested at home.

00:08:27.527 --> 00:08:29.733
W-Why would you be resting at home?

00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:33.257
Because I want to go relax. You guys give me such a hard time.

00:08:33.257 --> 00:08:35.815
D-Did the headquarters say something to you?

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.372
What do they have on you this time?

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:42.702
I realized crimes can't stay totally buried.

00:08:42.702 --> 00:08:47.893
They get revealed, one by one, as if the rain is sweeping the dirt away.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:53.706
That's why they say you cannot live with a guilty conscience. Drink up.

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:58.210
What the hell happened? You're killing me here.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.179
I've been released from my duties. I'm waiting for a new assignment.

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:05.116
- What?
- Is it because of what we've been investigating?

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:07.430
It's so unfair.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.498
I wanted to fire all of you guys before leaving my post as a chief,

00:09:11.498 --> 00:09:13.834
but they didn't even give me the chance. Aigoo.

00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:16.575
This is not right! We need to submit an appeal!

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:20.553
How can they fire someone just because we conducted an investigation?

00:09:20.553 --> 00:09:22.775
Don't you think it's less logical

00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:25.772
that you conducted an investigation your superiors ordered you not to touch?

00:09:25.772 --> 00:09:30.239
- Chief...
- That's why I said we should hand it over to headquarters!

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:35.275
What you guys are doing doesn't make sense, but I like it.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.538
Don't stop just because I got fired.

00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:43.330
I am fired,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.520

- Get up.
- What?

Yes, I saw the video. But what does it have to do with Minister Yoo?

Okay. I think it will take about 30 minutes. I'll see you there.

Don't try to get answers through the police.

I'll talk to you when it's time for my article.

00:10:56.716 --> 00:10:59.507
You can talk to me then if you have any comments.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.405
Would you like me to call you a cab?

00:11:14.405 --> 00:11:16.315
No, I'm fine.

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:20.250
I just want to walk. You guys can go back inside.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.391

He worked here for more than 20 years.

We got him kicked out of his own house.

I don't know what the right thing to do is anymore.

That video is from...

00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:37.124
Ms. Kim uploaded the video on our community forum page.

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:39.158
It was deleted right away.

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:43.871
It's more important to find out why someone deleted the video rather than who uploaded it.

00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.798
You think this has something to do with Minister Yoo, right?

Incheon Investment Trust belongs to Oh Jong Tae.

00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:54.727
And Oh Jong Tae attended a hearing to testify about Yoo Jeong Ryeol's corruption.

The landfill is in Minister Yoo's district.

00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:02.421
Do you get the gist of it now?

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:04.875
What do you want me to do with this?

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:07.218
The police are going to do the investigation.

00:13:07.218 --> 00:13:09.195
But if it doesn't gain public attention,

00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:13.120
the investigation will naturally come to a halt, like those in power want.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.726
I want you to prevent that.

00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:19.278
As you know, Minister Yoo's brother is the senior manager of our newspaper.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:21.441
You're a journalist.

00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:22.721
Don't you want this story?

00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:25.055
The police are involved in this too.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:28.303
It might lead you to betray them.

00:13:28.303 --> 00:13:29.228
I know that.

00:13:29.228 --> 00:13:30.650
Then why are you doing this?

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.735
Is this personal revenge for the police organization that abandoned you?

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:37.814
That would be foolish.

00:13:37.814 --> 00:13:41.933
What I want is power.

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:45.585
Power to break down the wall that is in my way.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.284
All right, let's do it. Together.

00:13:59.626 --> 00:14:02.478
Oh my! Hey!

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:07.626
You're not even feeling well!

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:10.257
You just take care of yourself!

00:14:10.257 --> 00:14:12.860
Don't faint again and get us get called to the hospital.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.555
I told you that I would do the cleaning.

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:15.666
Just your room.

00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.648
No, no. I'll do that too.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.432
You can just─

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.970
No.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.366
You quit your job, right?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.783
Yes. I told my manager that I was going to take some time off.

00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:33.240
- Your eye?
- It's not bloodshot anymore.

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:36.985
Go to your room and get some rest.

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:39.646
Don't do something I didn't ask you to do.

00:14:43.479 --> 00:14:46.674
Hey. Long time, no talk.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.202
Oh my! Really?

00:14:50.202 --> 00:14:52.913
Jae Woong came to you himself

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:54.305
to take judo lessons?

00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:55.921
Oh my gosh!

00:14:55.921 --> 00:14:59.366
But why does he want to learn judo all of a sudden?

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.157
Did you ask him?

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.570
What?

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:05.704
Really?

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:07.612
I see.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.546
He knows that his mom did judo?

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:14.195
He said he wants to be like his mom?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.269
Yeah. Hey,

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:28.086
please take good care of him.

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:31.616
Tell me if he's late paying for his lessons.

00:15:31.616 --> 00:15:36.707
I'll go work at a restaurant if I have to so that I can pay for it.

00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:39.797
Okay. Thank you!

00:15:39.797 --> 00:15:41.568
Bye.

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:50.614
Jae Woong, my baby.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.120
My baby.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.750
[Incheon West Police Station]

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.038
Hello.

00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:19.310
Where's the chief?

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.297
You didn't know he got dismissed from his duties?

00:16:21.297 --> 00:16:24.377
Oh, was that starting today?

00:16:24.377 --> 00:16:25.766
I forgot to check that.

00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:27.266
That's too bad.

00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:29.189
I wanted to say my last goodbye.

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:30.251
Hey, Yoon Sang Mi.

00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:31.524
I'm glad you're here.

00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:34.439
I was going to come see you anyway.

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:35.652
Be honest.

00:16:35.652 --> 00:16:36.970
You did this, right?

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.385
Yes, it was my job.

00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:42.115
You should fire me instead.

00:16:42.115 --> 00:16:44.030
Why would you kick an innocent man out?

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.636
Then that would mess with our plan.

00:16:47.636 --> 00:16:51.332
I told you to just keep pushing forward.

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:55.761
Reporter Jin told me everything yesterday.

00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.230
I heard Senior Manager Yoo is your target right now.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.556
Yoo Jeong Ryeol won't let you touch his brother.

00:17:01.556 --> 00:17:04.319
You would have to deal with some severe consequences.

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:09.549
I intentionally let Chief Moon take temporary refuge.

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:10.924
What?

00:17:10.924 --> 00:17:12.415
We don't have much time.

00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:18.282
The superiors are going to pick one of their own to replace the chief.

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.196
We need to expose this before that.

00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:25.636
I told you that power comes from information.

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:29.230
And you need power to take down another power.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.924
I also told you

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.960
to put it in simpler terms.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.330
- What are you doing?
- Damn.

00:17:40.766 --> 00:17:42.778
- Pause the video.
- Bastard. Get lost.

00:17:44.626 --> 00:17:46.126
That's the guy.

00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:48.937
Hyeongnim, we have so much to do already.

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:51.071
Why do we need to arrest a gangster?

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:55.895
It's a little complicated, but to put it in simpler terms...

00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:59.704
When Minister Yoo was the Congressman for his district...

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.041
What is that called again...

00:18:05.773 --> 00:18:08.307
Just do as I say, idiots.

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:10.145
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:18:11.303 --> 00:18:13.917
I don't even know how to explain it.

00:18:28.602 --> 00:18:31.741
I'm Kwon Jae Hong from Incheon's West Police Department.

00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:34.190
You're under arrest for assault.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.290
Look here.

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:37.330
At least let me finish my set.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.900
I have a routine.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.406
Wait... I lost my count. Damn.

00:18:45.406 --> 00:18:47.915
I'll just start again from five.

00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:49.180
You little...

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.646
- Five.
- Come here.

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:52.516
- I'll give you a personal training.
- Six.

00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:55.433
- I'll be your trainer.
- Seven.
- Stop it.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:56.312
Eight.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:18:58.212
Okay.

00:18:58.212 --> 00:19:00.471
Who is it?

00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:07.009
Get the guy's number and address.

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:11.597
I'm going to make sure he can't function in the society anymore.

00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:13.209
What?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.171
The uncle is the head of a patrol station?

00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:19.321
I can't believe this.

00:19:20.905 --> 00:19:24.383
Does he think he's got some kind of advantage because of that?

00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:27.335
Tell him to cut the nonsense.

00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:28.862
Okay?

00:19:28.862 --> 00:19:31.415
- Yeah.
- We need to take care of this.

00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.015
Okay.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.117
Can you give this to my son? Tell him it's a gift from his mom.

00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:45.196
You should take it to him yourself.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:47.403
I think he would like that more.

00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:48.715
I can't.

00:19:48.715 --> 00:19:51.734
His dad filed a restraining order against me.

00:19:51.734 --> 00:19:54.044
You can still see him in secret.

00:19:54.044 --> 00:19:56.246
I'll bring him out.

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:00.332
No.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:03.829
I don't want to tell my son to lie and say that he didn't see me.

00:20:03.829 --> 00:20:09.324
And Jae Woong has never lied in his life.

00:20:09.324 --> 00:20:12.121
He's such a nice kid.

00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:23.614
Is it good?

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:29.612
Are you happy you got your mom's gold medal?

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:33.477
Your mom misses you a lot.

00:20:33.477 --> 00:20:35.434
Don't you miss her too?

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:37.391
I miss her.

00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:39.491
But I can't see her.

00:20:39.491 --> 00:20:43.613
My dad said she would get arrested if I go see her.

00:20:43.613 --> 00:20:46.491
Hey! Your uncle is a cop!

00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:49.057
I think they'll let it slide.

00:20:51.092 --> 00:20:54.831
No. I'm going to just be patient.

00:20:54.831 --> 00:20:57.057
- It will be okay.
- Hey.

00:20:57.057 --> 00:21:00.990
I would go see her every day and play with her if I were you.

00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:03.644
What's wrong with you?

00:21:03.644 --> 00:21:07.191
I said I'm going to be patient.

00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:10.927
I just need to be patient.

00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.929
I don't want my mom to get arrested.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.091
You're such a good kid.

00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:37.078
Who told you to do it?

00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:39.656
You got paid to hit him, right?

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:42.380
No one told me to do it.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.469
That man glared at me first.

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:46.752
Let's not do this little dance.

00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:49.869
Only a bully would hit someone just because they glare at them.

00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:53.461
But you're someone who has lived a life of a gangster.

00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:55.008
What do you take me for?

00:21:55.008 --> 00:21:58.141
Are you saying that I'm part of a gang then?

00:21:58.141 --> 00:22:02.608
Is it okay for a cop to frame someone like this?

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:04.834
I just got mad and hit him

00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:06.694
for no reason.

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:10.571
Just lock me up for assault if you can.

00:22:13.135 --> 00:22:14.719
Come on, stop it!

00:22:14.719 --> 00:22:17.174
Damn it!

00:22:17.174 --> 00:22:19.174
That bastard!

00:22:19.174 --> 00:22:20.580
Hey, just let it go.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.888
I'm just going to kill him and go to prison!

00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:25.556
Aigoo! That's enough now!

00:22:25.556 --> 00:22:28.014
You need to lose that temper of yours!

00:22:29.635 --> 00:22:31.072
You bastard!

00:22:31.072 --> 00:22:36.183
If I ever see you again, I will make sure you never see the sky again!

00:22:36.183 --> 00:22:38.446
What's wrong with you?

00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:41.482
You'll get in trouble again!

00:22:47.745 --> 00:22:49.445
What?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.563
- Did he just laugh?
- Let's not do this little dance.

00:23:01.362 --> 00:23:04.585
You should just try to scare me directly.

00:23:04.585 --> 00:23:07.090
Or just hit me on the forehead

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.520
with something like this and make me bleed.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.177
Do it.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.619
Are you scared you might get in trouble?

00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:21.069
You'll only get a couple of months of suspension.

00:23:21.069 --> 00:23:22.471
Do it.

00:23:22.471 --> 00:23:25.044
Don't be scared. Just do it.

00:23:35.573 --> 00:23:37.563
Yes, he's asleep right now.

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:39.487
You should hurry.

00:23:40.198 --> 00:23:42.624
The director talked to his dad.

00:23:42.624 --> 00:23:46.570
He said he would be here in two hours and asked that he watch him until then.

00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:49.978
You just need to come before then.

00:23:49.978 --> 00:23:53.620
I think he's going to take a long nap because he's tired from his lesson.

00:24:49.963 --> 00:24:51.997
My baby.

00:25:30.682 --> 00:25:34.105
You need to get out of there right now. His dad is here.

00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:35.704
Hello?

00:25:35.704 --> 00:25:39.575
I'll stop by the market with him and be right there. Okay, bye.

Yes. I felt that too.

If someone tells me not to do something, I'll do it even more.

00:42:41.529 --> 00:42:42.654
I see.

00:42:42.654 --> 00:42:43.755
What about you?

00:42:43.755 --> 00:42:46.690
Me? I just want to climb the ladder to the top.

I'm going to get rid of everyone standing in my way and get to the top.

Ah, I knew it.

Rooting out the rotten people in the police was all a lie, right?

Of course! Firing a few people won't change the organization.

00:43:00.313 --> 00:43:06.629
But I think this case will feel at least a little rewarding as an officer.

I don't know.

I don't know if it will feel rewarding as a journalist.

00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:20.259
Like you said, this won't change the people or the society.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.580
I bought a luxury handbag recently.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.023
But it just sits at home.

00:43:34.023 --> 00:43:35.816
I do that too.

00:43:35.816 --> 00:43:38.510
I don't know why I bought it. I don't even carry it around.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.633
But doesn't looking at it make you happy?

00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:43.735
That's true.

00:43:43.735 --> 00:43:47.635
It's useless and I don't even know why I bought it,

00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:49.423
but you know...

00:43:49.423 --> 00:43:53.785
In life, there are luxury items that you want to treasure.

00:43:54.984 --> 00:43:57.968
Maybe this case will become that luxury item for us.

00:43:57.968 --> 00:44:00.404
It will make us happy every time we think about it.

00:44:03.959 --> 00:44:05.559

00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:18.298
I guess we're out of drinks?

00:44:18.298 --> 00:44:19.421
I'm going to quit drinking.

00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:21.238
You'll quit drinking?

00:44:21.238 --> 00:44:22.712
It would be easier for you to quit pooping.

00:44:22.712 --> 00:44:25.178
Ahjussi, why would you say that?

00:44:25.178 --> 00:44:28.789
She made a big decision. You should be praising her for it.

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:32.218
That's how he normally talks. Just let it go.

00:44:32.218 --> 00:44:34.306
You're so mean, Ahjussi.

Now I get why she has a hard time quitting drinking.

00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:40.328
I would be drinking a lot, too, if I had to live with someone like that.

00:44:40.328 --> 00:44:42.019
Ahjussi, what's wrong with you?

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:43.209
What did I do?

00:44:43.209 --> 00:44:46.833
Why are you so mean to your one and only sister?

00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:49.051
I didn't really do anything─

00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:52.620
You know what I think? He has an inferiority complex when it comes to me.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.414
You're right. You won several gold medals,

00:44:56.414 --> 00:44:58.966
and he only got one bronze medal, right?

00:44:58.966 --> 00:45:00.428
That must be why.

00:45:00.428 --> 00:45:01.694
What? That's not true.

00:45:01.694 --> 00:45:04.460
Eun Hye, you're right.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.853
I did win gold medals.

00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:10.498
And you only won one bronze medal.

00:45:10.498 --> 00:45:12.528
Is it a crime to be a good athlete?

00:45:12.528 --> 00:45:14.921
Why are you guys ganging up against me?

00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:17.295
Kang Eun Hui, what did you do to her?

00:45:17.295 --> 00:45:19.956
I didn't do anything to her.

00:45:19.956 --> 00:45:22.756
She just gave me confidence.

00:45:22.756 --> 00:45:26.931
No matter what, I'm going to bring Jae Woong back. I really can't live without him.

00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:30.187
If you don't want to see me kill myself, you should help too.

00:45:30.187 --> 00:45:31.202
Got it?

00:45:31.202 --> 00:45:35.994
We can't bring him here just because we want to.

00:45:35.994 --> 00:45:37.160
There's a trial and─

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.376
What's the point of having trials?

00:45:39.376 --> 00:45:41.288
It works in favor of people with power.

00:45:41.288 --> 00:45:45.102
You still don't get that after what happened to my dad?

00:45:45.102 --> 00:45:47.650
I need to talk to you.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.688
Why are you getting her involved in our family's business? Why?

00:45:50.688 --> 00:45:53.827
You can just talk to me here!

00:45:53.827 --> 00:45:55.710
Eun Hye is part of the family now.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.010
There's no need to hide anything.

00:46:01.295 --> 00:46:02.420
What?

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.120
Family?

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.275
You said you would keep Eun Hye by your side until you die.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.233
So she's family now.

00:46:11.233 --> 00:46:12.782
That's right. She's family.

00:46:12.782 --> 00:46:15.042
That's what family means.

00:46:16.594 --> 00:46:19.927
Living under one roof means we're family.

00:46:23.913 --> 00:46:25.713
Let's eat.

00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:33.003
- Eun Hui.
- What?

00:46:33.003 --> 00:46:34.306
Eun Hye.

00:46:34.306 --> 00:46:35.225
Yes?

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.475
Let's live happily ever after.

00:46:37.475 --> 00:46:40.334
Wow, that's gross!

00:46:49.272 --> 00:46:51.607
Thank you both so much.

00:46:56.828 --> 00:46:59.662
I'm the one who should be thankful.

00:46:59.662 --> 00:47:01.802
Thank you, Eun Hye.

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:04.060
You too, Eun Hui.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.564
You better brace yourself.

00:47:05.564 --> 00:47:08.381
There are two women in this house now, and only one man.

00:47:08.381 --> 00:47:10.446
It doesn't matter.

00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:16.084
My male hormones are decreasing.

00:47:16.084 --> 00:47:20.929
We might end up with only women in this house.

00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:25.461
You must be so proud of yourself.

[Ministry of Justice]

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.620
[Jeonghan Daily News]

00:48:09.477 --> 00:48:12.877
Hey. We could've just shared one issue.

00:48:12.877 --> 00:48:15.731
Why did each of you guys buy one?

00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:17.887
It's to commemorate it!

00:48:17.887 --> 00:48:21.644
We won't be able to work on such a big case again.

00:48:21.644 --> 00:48:24.399
I'm going to pass this issue down to my future generations

00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:26.515
showing how amazing their ancestor was.

00:48:26.515 --> 00:48:29.340
He locked up the Minister of Justice!

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.264
Aren't you guys worried?

00:48:31.264 --> 00:48:32.827
I'm so nervous!

00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:33.858
Do Chang,

00:48:33.858 --> 00:48:35.521
is it really okay for us to do this?

00:48:35.521 --> 00:48:36.579
What do you mean?

00:48:36.579 --> 00:48:39.293
All we did was arrest a criminal and make him confess to his crime.

00:48:39.293 --> 00:48:43.907
That's right. We just did our job as policemen.

00:48:43.907 --> 00:48:47.425
That's right. No need to overthink it.

00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:49.736
We just did our job.

00:48:49.736 --> 00:48:52.551
But it just so happens that the case is bigger than we expected.

00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:55.348
We didn't do anything that's not under our jurisdiction.

00:48:55.348 --> 00:48:57.002
I know, but...

00:48:57.002 --> 00:48:59.483
You're scared it will bite us in the butt?

00:48:59.483 --> 00:49:04.083
A Minister of Justice won't pay attention to people like us!

00:49:04.083 --> 00:49:07.972
It will only humiliate them further if they try to mess with us!

00:49:07.972 --> 00:49:12.363
The high officials will take care of it quickly on their own.

00:49:12.363 --> 00:49:14.212
Hey, you guys need to calm down too.

00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:15.887
This is nothing to boast about.

00:49:15.887 --> 00:49:18.460
If you want to boast about something, let's go catch the killer.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.901
Let's put the killer in prison and boast all we want.

00:49:21.901 --> 00:49:24.425
- Okay?
- Yes, sir!

00:49:28.535 --> 00:49:33.568
If we try to hide it, they'll think that you set the whole thing up.

00:49:33.568 --> 00:49:35.635
That's why we put your name on it.

00:49:35.635 --> 00:49:38.750
I thought it would be better to face it straight on.

00:49:40.004 --> 00:49:41.301
Tell me the truth.

00:49:41.301 --> 00:49:45.598
Did you know that Secretary Nam received money from Oh Jong Tae?

00:49:45.598 --> 00:49:49.650
I was only told that Oh Jong Tae had donated money.

00:49:50.285 --> 00:49:53.902
Then we can say that it was Secretary Nam's personal bribery.

00:49:53.902 --> 00:49:58.190
Say that you'll only take political responsibility for it, not legal responsibility.

00:49:59.527 --> 00:50:01.518
But you see...

00:50:01.518 --> 00:50:07.432
Why did the police expose this only now?

00:50:07.432 --> 00:50:10.136
Incheon's West Division arrested Secretary Nam.

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:13.589
They're the same ones who arrested Oh Jong Tae in front of me,

00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:16.435
and they're the ones who found Jo Seong Gi's remains.

00:50:16.435 --> 00:50:18.435
Why?

00:50:18.435 --> 00:50:21.507
Why is it always them?

00:50:21.507 --> 00:50:25.100
We're the only ones drawing the connection between those cases.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.980
Everyone else will see them as separate cases.

00:50:29.762 --> 00:50:33.844
Won't the truth come out someday?

00:50:35.287 --> 00:50:37.434
We can worry about that later.

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:40.000
Let's take care of the urgent matter first.

00:50:47.332 --> 00:50:48.832
Yes?

00:50:49.355 --> 00:50:51.842
Okay, let them in.

00:50:52.854 --> 00:50:54.363
A TV station is coming.

00:50:54.387 --> 00:50:57.320
Let's talk more after my interview.

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:09.375
What's wrong with you?

00:51:09.375 --> 00:51:11.497
What do you want?

00:51:13.144 --> 00:51:15.466
Who are you, you bastard?

00:51:15.466 --> 00:51:19.865
The former secretary of Yoo Jeong Ryeol, the Minister of Justice,

00:51:19.865 --> 00:51:23.187
was arrested for soliciting the assault that you just saw.

00:51:23.187 --> 00:51:26.302
He's also charged with accepting bribery from an investment trust company

00:51:26.302 --> 00:51:29.189
that tried to disrupt the one-man protest.

00:51:29.189 --> 00:51:35.374
We will conduct an exclusive interview with Minister Yoo regarding this issue.

00:51:35.374 --> 00:51:36.910
Hello Minister.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.050
Hello.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.830
I'm sure you've heard the details of the case from the press.

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:48.266
How do you feel about the suspicion that you're involved in this case?

00:51:48.266 --> 00:51:51.562
To be honest, I'm flustered.

00:51:51.562 --> 00:51:56.570
But I promise to take responsibility for what I must be responsible for.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:01.428
It sounds like you didn't know what your secretary was doing.

00:52:01.428 --> 00:52:04.905
I'm sure the truth will come out through an investigation.

00:52:04.905 --> 00:52:10.200
Some say this has a hidden political motive with the elections coming up.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.200
How do you feel about that?

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:17.145
This case has no political motive behind it whatsoever.

00:52:17.145 --> 00:52:19.455
It was due to my incompetence.

00:52:19.455 --> 00:52:23.533
I would like to apologize to the public.

00:52:23.533 --> 00:52:27.208
It seems like this will put a lot of pressure on the police.

00:52:27.232 --> 00:52:30.130
People are questioning whether the police will be

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:33.159
able to properly investigate a Minister of Justice.

00:52:33.159 --> 00:52:37.778
I will not exert any influence as a Minister of Justice on the police investigation.

00:52:37.778 --> 00:52:40.675
And I will not get involved in any way.

00:52:40.675 --> 00:52:44.561
I will not take reports about the investigation either.

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:48.925
And I believe in the fairness of the police.

00:52:48.925 --> 00:52:54.308
I will be looking forward to a proper investigation that follows every protocol.

00:52:54.308 --> 00:52:57.600
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.281
There are speculations about the police burying the case.

00:53:01.305 --> 00:53:04.684
The speculations are that the police purposefully ignored it when the victim,

00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:08.024
Kim Jin Sae, the leader of Incheon's Environmental Movement, filed a report.

00:53:08.024 --> 00:53:13.797
Some are speculating that a high police official was involved in this issue.

00:53:13.797 --> 00:53:15.342
You saw the news, right?

00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.469
Yes, I just watched it, sir.

00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:21.447
The Incheon West Division opened this case, right?

00:53:21.447 --> 00:53:24.636
Yes. Don't do anything about it.

00:53:24.636 --> 00:53:26.701
Let them do what they need to do.

00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:29.781
Make sure there is no talk about outside pressure.

00:53:29.781 --> 00:53:32.062
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:53:32.062 --> 00:53:35.633
The press will try to drag us down for this.

00:53:35.633 --> 00:53:40.714
I want your department to take care of that.

00:53:40.714 --> 00:53:41.748
Excuse me, sir?

00:53:41.748 --> 00:53:44.817
This has nothing to do with our department.

00:53:44.817 --> 00:53:46.673
We need a high official

00:53:46.673 --> 00:53:49.973
to take responsibility in order to quiet things down.

00:53:49.973 --> 00:53:54.006
The chief in charge of the case can take responsibility for it.

00:53:54.006 --> 00:53:56.702
That would be Chief Moon Sang Beom.

00:53:56.702 --> 00:53:59.772
The one you dismissed from his duties already.

00:53:59.772 --> 00:54:04.077
Do you think people will accept it if you try to destroy someone you've already abandoned?

00:54:04.077 --> 00:54:05.498
But why me?

00:54:05.498 --> 00:54:09.158
This case was started by a whistle-blower,

00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:13.404
and it came from the auditing department that manages the information about the police.

00:54:13.428 --> 00:54:15.028
What?

00:54:15.905 --> 00:54:17.996
Who would...

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:29.882
You. Why are you doing this to me?

00:54:29.882 --> 00:54:32.784
- What do you mean?
- The whistle-blower!

00:54:32.784 --> 00:54:34.114
It was you, right?

00:54:34.114 --> 00:54:35.478
Why are you dragging me in again?

00:54:35.478 --> 00:54:40.551
You planned with Incheon's West Police Department to have me take the fall for this!

00:54:40.551 --> 00:54:43.800
You planned all of it!

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.278
What's the point of asking about that now?

00:54:46.278 --> 00:54:51.345
Just accept what your superiors tell you to do.

00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:57.606
If you fight it, the path to the top will only get narrower for you.

00:54:57.606 --> 00:54:59.253
What?

00:55:09.169 --> 00:55:13.521
If I had met with Jo Seong Gi,

00:55:14.458 --> 00:55:17.925
I would've done something to him too.

00:55:18.864 --> 00:55:21.306
Don't make rash judgments.

00:55:21.306 --> 00:55:24.864
There's no proof that I killed Jo Seong Gi.

00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:32.942
What should we do?

00:55:32.942 --> 00:55:36.373
- You choose.
- What?

00:55:36.373 --> 00:55:41.733
Tell the truth about what happened and receive a sentence.

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:46.318
If you don't want to do that, then keep saying that you didn't do it.

00:55:46.318 --> 00:55:50.414
I'll do whatever it takes to bury it.

00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:56.046
You've aged.

00:55:56.717 --> 00:55:58.517
Jeong Seok,

00:55:58.517 --> 00:56:01.362
I'll accept whatever decision you make.

00:56:01.362 --> 00:56:04.365
Everything started because of me.

00:56:04.365 --> 00:56:07.089
Why did you get so weak?

00:56:07.089 --> 00:56:11.461
How are you going to be in politics if you're going to overreact over this?

00:56:11.461 --> 00:56:15.349
I'm not afraid to give up everything.

00:56:16.522 --> 00:56:19.655
Stop with the nonsense and go get some rest.

00:56:19.655 --> 00:56:22.370
Your sense of judgment isn't as sharp as it used to be.

00:56:23.373 --> 00:56:25.673
Jeong Seok!

00:56:25.673 --> 00:56:27.967
You need to decide before it's too late.

00:56:27.967 --> 00:56:31.434
That will save both of us.

00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:34.701
Just go on your own separate path.

00:56:34.701 --> 00:56:38.117
That's what I need.

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:57.729
I got a call from Lieutenant Yoon earlier.

00:56:57.729 --> 00:57:00.544
Director Go is going to step down from his position in the auditing department.

00:57:00.544 --> 00:57:04.695
There's no one in the police who can stop you or Detective Kang now.

00:57:04.695 --> 00:57:06.320
Yeah.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.513
Things are going so smoothly.

00:57:08.513 --> 00:57:10.950
Minister Yoo has also promised not to get involved.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:13.159
There won't be outside pressure.

00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:16.219
That will naturally get rid of Oh Jong Tae's shield.

00:57:16.219 --> 00:57:19.694
All we have left is my senior manager, right?

00:57:20.706 --> 00:57:23.306
But that will be even more difficult.

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:27.179
It will be really hard to find proof of Jo Seong Gi's murder.

00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:31.437
We can only hope for Senior Manager Yoo's confession.

00:57:31.437 --> 00:57:32.358
He won't do it, right?

00:57:32.358 --> 00:57:36.036
Do you still think that he also killed Detective Jang?

00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.566
Yoo Jeong Seok and Nam Gook Hyeon. It must be one of the two of them.

00:57:38.566 --> 00:57:41.124
They both have clear motives.

00:57:41.786 --> 00:57:44.614
My boss killing Jo Seong Gi...

00:57:44.614 --> 00:57:47.787
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:57:47.787 --> 00:57:52.447
He drove my senior manager's one and only sister to her death.

00:57:52.447 --> 00:57:54.749
But I don't know about Detective Jang.

00:57:54.749 --> 00:57:57.723
I don't think he would do that.

00:58:03.579 --> 00:58:09.664
He used the audio recording to send an innocent man to his execution

00:58:09.664 --> 00:58:13.680
in order to bury the murder he committed.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.774
And he helped Oh Jong Tae even though he knew he was the real killer,

00:58:16.774 --> 00:58:18.987
for the same reason.

00:58:18.987 --> 00:58:23.636
Wouldn't it be more despicable if he did all those things when he didn't kill anyone?

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:33.537
It's going to get even harder to trust people from now on.

00:58:40.802 --> 00:58:42.829
[Oh Jong Tae]

00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:51.577
Hello, Minister.

00:58:51.577 --> 00:58:53.538
Hello.

00:58:53.538 --> 00:58:55.901
Is now a good time to talk?

00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:57.858
Please go ahead.

00:58:57.858 --> 00:59:01.480
What you said on the news today bothered me.

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.414
I understand the position you're in,

00:59:04.414 --> 00:59:06.840
but you remember the promise you made me, right?

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.808
You had that in mind during your interview, right?

00:59:11.808 --> 00:59:15.688
I never promised you anything.

00:59:15.688 --> 00:59:16.711
Minister.

00:59:16.711 --> 00:59:22.446
As you saw on the news, I won't interfere with the police investigation of you.

00:59:22.446 --> 00:59:24.115
Let me give you a last piece of advice.

00:59:24.115 --> 00:59:29.119
You will end up paying for whatever you did.

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:34.959
And the longer you try to hang on to me, the more your sentence will increase.

00:59:34.959 --> 00:59:37.353
Minister.

00:59:37.353 --> 00:59:40.117
This will harm your brother greatly.

00:59:40.117 --> 00:59:41.522
Are you okay with that?

00:59:41.522 --> 00:59:43.034
I'm hanging up.

00:59:43.034 --> 00:59:45.534
I won't be speaking to you again.

00:59:54.882 --> 00:59:57.315
He wants us to go down together?

00:59:57.315 --> 00:59:59.345
No, not me.

00:59:59.345 --> 01:00:02.497
Why should I have to go down with you guys?

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:08.139
Nothing is stopping us now.

01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:11.815
As you said, all I have to do is keep pushing forward.

01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:13.497
I told you.

01:00:13.497 --> 01:00:16.998
You need to solve it before the new chief comes in.

01:00:16.998 --> 01:00:21.187
The new chief will try to stop you guys.

01:00:21.187 --> 01:00:23.637
You need to hurry up and close the case before he does.

01:00:23.637 --> 01:00:26.637
Okay. Thanks.

01:00:27.848 --> 01:00:29.548
Yeah.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:34.556
They wouldn't let us go this easily.

01:00:34.556 --> 01:00:39.645
Prosecutor. It's only been two days since we arrested Secretary Nam!

01:00:39.645 --> 01:00:41.528
We haven't even finished writing up our report!

01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:44.393
Can you hold off on taking him?

01:00:44.393 --> 01:00:47.143
Those bastards.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:51.725
We did all the work, but they're trying to take credit for it.

01:00:51.725 --> 01:00:53.279
He can hear you!

01:00:53.279 --> 01:00:58.006
Even the Minister of Justice said that he trusts our investigation!

01:00:58.006 --> 01:01:00.246
Let me talk to him.

01:01:00.246 --> 01:01:01.050
Why?

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.708
I have to tell him something.

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.711
Whatever. Here.

01:01:06.578 --> 01:01:08.552
This is Kang Do Chang from violent crimes.

01:01:08.552 --> 01:01:13.846
We'll hand over Secretary Nam to you.

01:01:16.181 --> 01:01:17.681
Yes.

01:01:17.681 --> 01:01:20.224
In exchange, get us an arrest warrant.

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:21.850
If you get us that,

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:27.270
we'll leave you guys to do whatever you want with Secretary Nam.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:29.950
Who is that?

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:32.368
Who are you guys?

01:01:39.134 --> 01:01:40.934
- Hey!
- Where are you going.

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.300
Hey! Take pictures!

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.155
Get out of here!

01:01:47.155 --> 01:01:49.139
Get out, right now!

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.440
- Get out!
- Please leave this place.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.520
How dare you barge in here?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.630
- I said you need to leave!
- Get out.

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:58.600
- I said, get out!
- What's going on?

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.164
We have a search and seizure warrant.

01:02:01.164 --> 01:02:03.926
This is Jeonghan Daily News!

01:02:03.926 --> 01:02:07.616
Are you guys out of your mind? Do you think you can handle the consequences?

01:02:07.616 --> 01:02:10.748
If you keep getting in our way, we'll arrest you for obstruction of justice.

01:02:10.748 --> 01:02:12.732
Do you really want to do this?

01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:14.790
You guys are way out of line!

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.876
This isn't right. Please go back to your station.

01:02:16.876 --> 01:02:19.900
The warrant isn't for Jeonghan Daily News.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:23.353
It's a personal search and seizure warrant for Senior Manager Yoo Jeong Seok.

01:02:23.353 --> 01:02:25.546
He's being charged with murder.

01:02:25.546 --> 01:02:27.130
- What?
- Murder?

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:28.900
What?

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.838
Let them pass!

01:02:42.597 --> 01:02:47.773
I will only permit the seizure of things that are related to the case.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.479
I'm warning you.

01:02:51.433 --> 01:02:53.767
You should be careful with this.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.440
Sure.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.040
That too.

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:36.490
Carefully! Be careful.

01:04:05.772 --> 01:04:08.750
What should we do? Should we confront them?

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:12.348
It's a personal matter. Just let it pass.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.020
Senior Manager. Shouldn't you explain yourself to us?

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.954
Why does Jeonghan Daily need to get humiliated like this?

01:04:25.954 --> 01:04:28.638
What do I need to explain?

01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:31.771
The truth.

01:04:31.771 --> 01:04:33.589
The truth?

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.850
I...

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:43.121
only killed someone who deserved to die.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.580
Is he out of his mind?

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.860
Did he really kill him?

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:06.780

~ Preview ~
Just go in for conspiracy to murder. That's your best option.

01:05:24.271 --> 01:05:27.686
I don't get it. How come people like you don't know how to be thankful?

01:05:27.686 --> 01:05:32.195
There's evidence that proves Yoo Jeong Seok killed both Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo.

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.201
This murderer....

01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:36.766
If you see him before I get there, read him his charges and arrest him.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.853
Let me just leave quietly today.

01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:40.382
Nam Gook Hyeon might be right.

01:05:40.382 --> 01:05:42.655
All we can depend on now is Yoo Jeong Seok's conscience.

01:05:42.655 --> 01:05:45.053
What's the real truth?

01:05:45.053 --> 01:05:47.204
Jeonghan Daily News only reports the truth.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:49.988
I believe I still have some work to do.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.945
I'll be handing you a big present soon.

01:05:51.945 --> 01:05:54.682
Where can I find that present?

01:05:54.682 --> 01:05:56.483
I'm the present I was going to give you.

01:05:56.483 --> 01:05:59.078
I am your present.
