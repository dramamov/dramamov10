00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.600
What?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.580
Let's eat.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.610
Sure.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.300
I have some things to take care of. I'll call you after I'm done.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.700
Okay, call me.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.260
They turned off the phone.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.750
It was on just a moment ago, right?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.170
Yes.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.490
Can you track the location?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.300
Yes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.470
Okay.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.370
I know.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.050
Then see you there in about an hour.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.060
Chief.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.860
Chief?

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.140
Yes?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.440
Is something going on?

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.930
Is Kang Do Chang still in the office?

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.440
Yes. What? Should I call him?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.940
Let's drink together, the three of us. It's been a while.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.260
This is the belly of a bluefin tuna.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.990
This is steamed abalone.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.060
I had a call with Michael.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
He admitted to alerting the broadcasting station.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.420
He complimented Tae Ho a lot. He said that I married well.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.600
Michael is not a small fish, either.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.810
People who know that I was scammed in Japan...

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.760
there aren't too many of them.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.930
A CEO from a big company once said this:

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.980
"You can replace everyone except family."

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.280
But aren't family members also replaceable?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.840
Are you talking about Tae Ho?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.040
He's irreplaceable.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.390
He would become the biggest enemy of our family if we did.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.690
He knows the weaknesses of our entire family.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.720
And I won't switch him out.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.800
He's the only person who can push an insulin shot into my side.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.200
You're sick of me, right?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.940
- Excuse me?
- I was a pain in your ass for a while.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.780
Aren't you sick of me?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.640
Well, what can I do? I can't switch out the chief.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.610
Why? Are you going somewhere, Chief?

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.110
Is it possibly a promotion?

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.880
You said that my chance to get promoted was three percent.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.630
That's not something that can be recovered,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.540
because you all got rid of the ninety-seven percent.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.390
I'm done, but Do Chang, you need to get promoted.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.310
How long are you going to stay mushed under your colleague?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.480
- Aren't you embarrassed?
- Then is Do Chang getting a promotion?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.320
Not right away, but at the Gyeonggi main office,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.110
between the information division and the public security division, choose one.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.980
You'll be going as a team leader.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.610
That's good.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.310
That's the usual promotion path.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.720
Congratulations Do Chang.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.190
Why? Why suddenly?

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.760
You guys caught Lee Seong Gon.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.070
The commissioner ordered it himself.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.450
He said he would send the rest of the Team 2 members anywhere they wanted.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.230
Bong Sik, you gather the applications from them.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.730
They said Seoul is okay, and they can even apply to the main office.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.880
That's good.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.150
They'll be thrilled to death.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.210
There's no reason for the higher-ups to do us favors.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.050
We made a big mess with the Lee Dae Cheol case and, this time, with Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.780
There's that huge investigation around it. Why?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.080
What's the reason?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.600
They're trying to separate us.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.240
This is just bullshit trying to lower the power of the investigation.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.080
Sure, you can look at it that way.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.450
However,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.620
I can block punishments, but I can't stop awards.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.730
That's the right of the people accepting them.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.390
Hey.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.170
Hey, where do you think you're going?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.630
I'm leaving because I want to.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.970
There's no reason to suck up to you anymore, Chief.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.970
- Hey, Do Chang, you shouldn't do this.
- Let go.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.910
Let him be. Sit down.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.420
For him and me... This place is our hometown.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.520
Do you think he would be in a good mood?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.230
Even so, this isn't a bad thing.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.600
Do you think he believes things are going well?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.410
No.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.050
Department Leader,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.460
if you were still a detective, and if you were in charge of the Jeong Hui Joo case,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.130
how would you run the investigation?

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.960
First, I'd have to get the support from the cyber investigation team.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.360
Because if it's a person crazy enough to copy a serial killer,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.880
they would've left some kind of trace online.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.920
Correct if the motive was simply to copy a murder.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.310
But what if they found a person with a clear motive around her?

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.850
Wouldn't the investigation have to change directions?

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.280
I'm not sure.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.370
Jeong Hui Joo was not the type of person to anger anyone. Also,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.720
as an employee of a large corporation, the chances of being involved in other crimes are slim.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.270
The purpose was most likely a sexual assault.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.570
There's no chance that there are other motives, right?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.200
Correct.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.650
Then, why are the Incheon West Station detectives

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.940
digging around Jeong Hui Joo?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.240
It's because Oh Ji Hyeok is at the Incheon West Station.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.540
Could they connect the case from two years ago with the Jeong Hui Joo case?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.550
Yes.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:41.640
He could assume they are the same culprit.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.670
Even so, he's just a detective with a simple lieutenant title.
[Here's the information you requested]

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.940
Do I really have to worry about him?

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.350
I'm sending him

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:08.660
as well as the other team members to good places. Why is he throwing a fit? Why?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.060
He's just a little pissed, not throwing a fit.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.560
That's throwing a fit. What else would it be?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.470
How dare he get up from his chair in front of the chief?

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.000
That bastard, who has a much lower rank!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.130
You told me to leave him alone, earlier.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.760
What's your problem?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.010
You're weird these days. You keep talking back to me every time!

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.690
If we changed places because we did well, of course, that would be good for us.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.400
But you already know.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.230
The intention is so obvious.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.300
Hey!

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:51.410
Is the Jeong Hui Joo investigation so important? Is he the only Korean detective?

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.670
Someone else can do it!

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.390
The problem is that some other people can't do it.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.730
Why? Why not?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.820
Is Jeong Hui Joo his daughter?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.410
So why...

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.100
why did you choose a person like Kang Do Chang to be a detective?

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.700
You should've chosen people like you, who are obsessed with promotions,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.950
or people like me, who stay down and just go with the flow!

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.940
Why did you choose someone like him to be a policeman? Why?

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.210
Why are you asking me?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.930
Did I choose him?

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.690
Thank you for choosing a hard path.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.560
Hey, this won't even cover the lawyer's fees.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.520
Don't you think we should get a good lawyer?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.510
Yoo Na's your friend. Are you going to leave her to rot in jail?

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.640
I'll give you more later. This is all I have right now.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.030
Is it because I've been seeing you a lot?

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.530
You're kind of cute.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.390
Look at you.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.140
Hey!

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.300
What are you doing, you bastard? Hey!

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.500
- Ahjussi!
- Hey, you shit! Stop there!

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.730
Hey, what did you do to Eun Hye?

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.870
I didn't do anything!

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.150
You bastard, you took money from Eun Hye! You bastard!

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.180
That's the money that Eun Hye stole!

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.940
Asshole, who do you think Eun Hye is?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.640
You two! What are you doing?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.100
Hold on.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.060
Wait, let me finish what I was doing. Okay?

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.860
Detective Kang!

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.230
Hey.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.920
My back! My back! Seriously!

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.450
Your back?

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.750
Shut up!

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.550
Ahjussi, please take me to the hospital. I think my back is really hurt.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.680
You little shit─

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.500
Calm down, Detective Kang.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.580
I think you need to explain the situation to me.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.160
I caught him in the midst of a crime. I saw him take money.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.250
This...

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.140
this is the money he took.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.430
- Is that true?
- No, it's not.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.470
She paid it back to me.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.410
Earlier you said she stole it, you bastard!

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.930
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.120
This bastard.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.390
He didn't take it, I gave it to him.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.800
Why? Did he threaten you?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.000
No, it's just...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.470
I was helping a friend because they were having a difficult time.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.810
Okay.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.130
Go ahead and go home. I'll take care of the rest here.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.120
Nothing bad will happen to you, right?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.880
I've been working as a policeman for twenty years.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.530
This is a piece of cake. Don't worry and go home.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.880
Trust me.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.490
Then,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.780
do as Detective Oh says.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.460
If you promise, then I'll go.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.860
What?

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.510
Thank you. Have a good night.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.820
Hey, "Thank you, have a good night."

Hyeongnim, stop making this a big deal.

You bastard, how dare you show off money in front of me.

Can we really go anywhere we want?

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.540
Yes. It's the commissioner's order, so you can trust you'll go for sure.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.450
Wow. Then, can we go to Gangnam, Seoul?

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:40.320
You can. However, consider your abilities and circumstances before deciding

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.040
so you don't get kicked out after choosing somewhere.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.380
Let's see, should I go to the kingdom of Seoul Main Agency?

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.540
Hyeong, if you go there, you'll just end up having to overwork yourself.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.320
Let's go together to Gangnam. It's the best place in Seoul.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.280
- Gangnam?
- You guys,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.630
do you even have money to buy homes in Seoul?

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.490
- Are you going to live in the homeless area at Seoul Station?
- I forgot about that.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.570
Isn't it a bit suspicious?

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.640
Why? Out of nowhere? Why are they being good to us?

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.590
In my opinion, the commissioner is an excuse, and this is the chief's strategy.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.420
What about the chief? We have a good relationship with him these days.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.840
Can't you see from a glance?

He's trying to kick me out because it feels like I'm going to date Ms. Bo Kyeong.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.510
It's weird to only kick me out, so he's trying to send everyone at once.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.570
I'm going back to the American headquarters today.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.400

He definitely has a powerful client.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.270

I filmed it with a body cam.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.570
Did you also upload it on the internet?

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.770
- No.
- That was me.

It was you again?

The other members don't do social media that well.

Does this mean the chief wants to keep me by his side?

That means there's someone suspicious among her colleagues.

Detective Oh Ji Hyeok told me about the assault case from two years ago.

At that time, the first witness was Woo Tae Ho,

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.070
the supervisor of TJ Group's legal team.

It's not an assault case, but a murder case.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.930
Your name was on Jeong Hui Joo's phone records many times,

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:40.370
which makes you one of the key suspects.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.750
She doesn't talk that easily, right?

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.010
She talked easily.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.690
What are the basics of detective work?

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.460
Insight into human beings. An aura that opens the opponent's mouth.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.010
You don't have even a bit of that.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.620

This is why I'm learning from you.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.220
She admitted that they were friends,

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.670

That Cheon Sang Woo, it's definite that he's the one that assaulted her?

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:39.970
If that's true, back then, he could've committed the same crime against Jeong Hui Joo.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:45.010
And just like before, Woo Tae Ho, a former prosecutor, came forward and took care of it.

There's a possibility that it was manipulated. You can't trust it as it is.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.570
I've raised Hui Joo since she was a baby,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:25.710

Yes. I asked my father,

and I think he's not such a good person.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:10.650
There's a rumor that he was kicked out of the MIU because he took too many bribes.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:14.070
When I first met him, he was showing off his money too.

Yes. Out of all the gowns used in the crimes, only the one on Jeong Hui Joo had a tag.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.270
That means you could find the manufacturer.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.290
Yes, we checked and visited the manufacturer.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.650
According to the employee there, they don't make sales directly to the store.

They usually sign a contract with big hospitals and send the gowns there.

What's more important for a detective than investigating a case?

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.260
What did you say about me?

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.030
I said what you told me to.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.990
"You like money, women, and you're a bottom feeder."

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.820
"He's not what he looks like. He's dark inside, so he seems like a sociopath."

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.640
You didn't have to go that far.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.530
You told me to say you're a bad guy.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:03.540
Yeah, good job.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.000
By the way.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.880
What's the reason Director Cheon wants to see you?

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.190
She must have something to say to me that's related to the investigation.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.110
That's good, then.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.940
But it's not like she has other reasons or anything, right?

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.520
Perhaps. "...likes money, and women..."

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.900
I guess it could be that.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.960

You understand, right?

Yes.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.940

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.370
Yes.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.120
Did you find out who the culprit in that case was?

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.330
Kind of.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.790
Did the victim talk?

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.970
No.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.720
Then how?

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.100
It was difficult.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.570
He is someone who usually uses cash, so we couldn't confirm the card usage records,

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:49.630
and the CCTVs in the interior were all removed, so there was no video evidence from that day either.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:54.820
However, considering the circumstances, there's a person I'm suspicious of,

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.510
so I asked the chauffeur who drives his car.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:02.090
"This is the secretary's office. He said he left his phone last night."

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.260
"Where would that be?"

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.430

The site where Kim Min Ji was assaulted. It was at that very site.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.120
Then why couldn't you catch the culprit?

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.390
I didn't have any incriminating evidence.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:24.560
He is quite a great person, so I couldn't prosecute him with only that much.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.040
That's a shame.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.210
If you had incriminating evidence,

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.250
I would've been willing to make a deal.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.250
Luckily, I'm working on a case that's related to that.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.180
If I keep digging into that case, I think the evidence for the assault case will come along too.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.210
That means you're willing to start it again?

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.790
The deal you mentioned earlier, what does that mean?

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.100
Let's talk again once you have incriminating evidence.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.420
We can set the deal price then.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.060
Okay.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.190

[A warm and trustworthy police force for the people]

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.000
Ms. Bo Kyeong!

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.920
Aigoo. Did you two drink together?

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.930
No. He drank by himself and fell.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.980
Can I leave him with you?

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.560
Yes. We'll take care of it.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.310
I'm going to go then.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.530
Wait just a moment.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.190
I'll take care of him and take you home quickly.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.650
No. If my father finds out, it'll be bad, so I have to go.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.250
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.900
Goodbye.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:46.760
You saw it clearly, right? Give up now.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.320
She said they didn't drink together, but he drank by himself and fell asleep.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.210
Stop it, please!

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.920
Even the way she walks looks pretty.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.960
Hyeong, I'll take over if it's too hard.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.380
It's okay. I'll put him in the resting room,

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.920
so you go ahead and start checking the footage on Gi Dong Jae.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.420
Okay.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.400
You have to put a blanket on him.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.020
It's bad for drunk people to sleep in cold places.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.400
I know that! I already know that!

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.410
He can sleep wherever, who cares?

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.210
You should look when someone comes over.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:26.600
Why? Do you hate me again?

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:36.140
Forget about the past me, okay?

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.180
I'm good to you now.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:45.820
The detectives have started visiting me.

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:51.890
Meet with them.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.900
If they come, meet with them,

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:02.170
and when you meet them, you just need to say you don't know, no matter what.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:05.240
They will find it more suspicious if you avoid them.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.480
Hui Joo.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:11.910
Who killed her?

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.080
How would I know that?

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.820
She died because of me, right?

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.800
Because I told her about you?

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.430
So?

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.120
Did you tell that to the detectives?

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.950
Not yet.

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.810
Then go ahead.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.040
If you can deal with it.

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.260
You bastard.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.360
Do you want to die?

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.590
Kill me because I'll make you regret it if you don't kill me now.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.530
You have something up your sleeve, don't you?

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.460
What is it?

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.580
Return Soo Yeon to me first.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.580
You can't raise her, nor do you have the right to.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.820
Soo Yeon is my daughter. My daughter that I gave birth to!

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.660
Min Ji,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.090
I can't say

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.840
that I love you.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.700
But I do feel a moral responsibility, and I usually can't feel those kinds of emotions.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:35.230
I'm squeezing them out the best I can.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:39.140
Don't make me lose even that much.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:52.080
From now on, don't drink alone.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.730
Drinking alone makes a person have strange imaginings.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.960
Don't imagine negative things.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.070
It's not good for the mother or the child.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.810
There's something I need you to check for me.

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:28.460
Yes?

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.480
Just send me the address and the passcode.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.860
I'll contact you once I check it out.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.960
He's a knife expert.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.240
Two years ago, the boss of the East Gangnam Gang was murdered.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.660
Gi Dong Jae, the knife expert from the same gang, was the main suspect,

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.240
but someone else was arrested, so he was free of the allegations.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.810
Gi Dong Jae killed him.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.390
Yes. The detective in charge manipulated it to be someone else and let him go.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.120
Are you sure that it was he who stole the gown from the hospital?

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.480
Yes. We confirmed on the CCTV footage that Gi Dong Jae snuck in from outside.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.340
However, the doctors don't really track the hospital gowns.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.440
They said they wouldn't notice if a single gown was missing.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.690
- What does he do now?
- He's a representative at a meat processing wholesaler.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:20.020
We have also confirmed that the TJ headquarters cafeteria gets deliveries from that company.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.520
What should we do? Should we go right away?

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.740
Isn't the person behind him more important than he?

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.790
He's coming out.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.070
Let's go.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.880
Michael Cha went back to the American headquarters.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:51.890
I believe that TJ will be discussed at their director's meeting.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:55.690
Then send Na Na to America.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:59.920
The American McQueen headquarters blocked all means of communication.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.740
They won't even meet with Na Na.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.980
I'm not telling you to send her for just a while.

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.560
I'm telling you to transfer her to a branch in America.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:13.760
- Chairman, if Director Cheon leaves at a time like this─
- It's better if she's gone.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.490
Yeah.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:30.120
It's an apartment in downtown Seoul, and Gi Don Jae just went in.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.790
Yes.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:34.170
Nothing big will happen during the daytime, right?

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:36.110
He must've come to meet with his lover.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.910
Okay. We'll go there just in case.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.580
Send us the address.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.380
Okay.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.540
Where did he go to?

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.120
An apartment in Seoul.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:52.750
It's not an address where TJ people would live.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.320
It's in the Gangnam area.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.410
Where in Gangnam?

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:08.730
I left in a hurry, so I left a few documents at home.

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.720
What do we need?

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.740
I'll check the documents and call back.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.700
Okay.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.940
- Did he not come out yet?
- No.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.210
His car?

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.640
It's that, and this is the apartment he went into.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.570
Is this the only entrance?

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:35.290
There's one at the parking lot side, but his car is here, so he should come this way.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.050
Hyeongnim, this is Kim Min Ji's apartment.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:38.310
Kim Min Ji?

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.660
The hair salon is near here, so I looked into it,

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.280
and her address is here.

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.870
I think we need to go and check.

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.240
Let's go.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.250
Call Kim Min Ji.

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.990
Okay.

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:52.690
The line is busy.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.800
I already called the salon that's in America,

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.380
I told them to send the documents through email.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.790
Then the documents needed for the work visa interview are okay, right?

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.780
Okay.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.730
I'll see you later then.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.670
What is it?

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:18.020
Why are you here?

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.680
Is everything okay?

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.400
Can you please open the door for a little bit?

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.980
Okay, one moment, please.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.400
Send the detectives away.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.800
Send them away quietly if you don't want to die.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.680
What is it?

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.340
Did anyone come to visit you?

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.360
No.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.050
No one came by.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.490
Yeah? We're chasing a suspect right now,

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.790
and we confirmed that he came this way.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.090
I'm fine, so you can head back.

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:24.870
But we need to at least check for now─

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.900
I said I'm fine.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.610
And my parents are here right now.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:33.670
I don't want to surprise them. If something happens,

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.520
I'll contact you.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.240
Okay. Sure.

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.170
Don't you think Gi Dong Jae is the one in her house and not her parents?

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.460
Yes.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.100
Gi Dong Jae is meeting with Kim Min Ji.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.430
What's their relationship?

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.490
- Hyeongnim.
- What?

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.050
I need to take a shit.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.960
Go quickly.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.440
I think there was one over there.

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:46.610
Take him to a doctor, please!

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:51.160
Hyeongnim, Man Goo is not the type of guy who shits just anywhere.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.270
He only goes to places where something happened or something will happen.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.530
I have a feeling something will happen here too.

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.950
Can his anus tell the future?

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.030
- Hyeongnim!
- What is it? Is it another boar?

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:07.400
It's Gi Dong Jae! He came out of the basement parking lot in a car.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.500
Didn't you see?

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.210
Hey, go!

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.410
It's this car.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.570
Hey, chase him. Arrest him the moment you find him.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.440
Okay, let's go.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.530
Hyeongnim.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.420
This is Kim Min Ji's car.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.940
[Car owner: Kim Min Ji]

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.740
Call 911, hurry. Hurry!

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:42.680
Hyeongnim, come here and look at this.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.220
Why?

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.260
What is this?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.340
This is the security camera footage from the assault that happened two years ago.

Are you trying to hide or reveal the culprit?

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.000
I can only hide it when the culprit is revealed.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.640
Why do you have that?

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.890
She purposely gave us evidence that's disadvantageous to Cheon Sang Woo?

Hui Joo died because of you.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.620
Why are you telling me that now?

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.880
