00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:20.984
Do you know what he said

00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:22.694
after what he's done?

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:25.447
You look fine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.657
Did you just say fine?

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:29.117
Hey, this car.

00:14:29.242 --> 00:14:30.577
And this porcelain.

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:32.246
So you want $100,000
in return?

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:34.123
For this porcelain?

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.375
It's not just a porcelain.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.045
It was Moon Porcelain
by Artist Lee Eun-sang.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.422
Oh, the bone.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.300
The bone will heal over time,
but that's...

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.803
- When's the perpetrator arriving?
- He'll be here soon.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.304
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.598
Thanks for your testimony today.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.351
I'll talk to the perpetrator
about it later.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.146
Bye for now.

00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:58.106
Prosecutor Seo.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.525
Even if he appeals to pity,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.818
- don't forget.
- Mr. Joo.

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:03.821
- Or I'll be dead.
- You can go now.

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:06.490
- Please.
- I heard you.

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:07.741
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:12.621
But the perpetrator wouldn't do
such thing.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:15.333
That diner is pretty famous
in the area.

00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:16.417
Lee Kyung-hak?

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:17.919
Is the food that good?

00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:20.088
Sir.

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:22.465
If you don't mind,
can I take a look at the file?

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.466
Sure.

00:15:24.342 --> 00:15:26.136
I have no money to give you.

00:15:28.054 --> 00:15:29.639
Did you just hit me?

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:30.974
What's going on?

00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:32.809
Hit me again in front of everyone.

00:15:32.934 --> 00:15:34.686
I barely pushed him.

00:15:35.103 --> 00:15:37.356
Your car and the porcelain.
They're all a scam, aren't they?

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.945
I think we need an insider.

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:44.655
For a free ride?

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:46.282
Are you sure he's reliable?

00:15:49.368 --> 00:15:51.704
The chief prosecutor is
paying attention to this case.

00:15:52.747 --> 00:15:53.998
Both you and I have to be careful.

00:15:54.123 --> 00:15:55.333
You know I'm good.

00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:58.128
Breaking the car and porcelain
wasn't enough, are you hitting me?

00:15:58.253 --> 00:16:00.213
- Here.
- Did I break your porcelain?

00:16:00.338 --> 00:16:02.716
Do you have the evidence?
Bring me the evidence.

00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:03.800
What's going on?

00:16:05.886 --> 00:16:07.596
It's nothing serious.
It's just a car accident.

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.599
It's not. Do you know
how much that porcelain's worth?

00:16:10.724 --> 00:16:12.977
He always likes to cause a ruckus.

00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:15.771
People will think this hallway is
where the accident occurred.

00:16:15.896 --> 00:16:17.440
I'll take care of it quickly.

00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:19.442
Did you receive the case?

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:20.902
Did you send it to him?

00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:25.657
Keep up the good work.

00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:28.368
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:30.412
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

00:16:30.537 --> 00:16:32.205
- Aren't you coming?
- I am.

00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:35.751
Watch your mouth.

00:16:35.876 --> 00:16:38.045
Prosecutor Seo, you need to add
assault to his--

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.129
Damn it.

00:16:40.214 --> 00:16:41.799
Disturbance and nuisance
in the public office.

00:16:41.924 --> 00:16:43.217
Both of you.

00:16:49.223 --> 00:16:50.349
You may begin.

00:17:10.913 --> 00:17:12.623
I told you to speak.
Why are you so quiet?

00:17:12.748 --> 00:17:14.333
You looked like you had
so much to say earlier.

00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:17.586
I'm

00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:21.215
sorry. I admit it.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.508
That settles it.

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:23.634
But

00:17:24.302 --> 00:17:26.804
how did I know he had
something so expensive in his car?

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:30.225
Even if there was nothing,
you shouldn't jump into the road.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.643
It wasn't a crosswalk.

00:17:31.768 --> 00:17:33.186
It's 100 percent your fault.

00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:35.021
Are you telling me to pay him
$100,000?

00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:37.649
You should've made an effort
to resolve it.

00:17:37.774 --> 00:17:39.943
'I can't pay you.
It's your fault.'

00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:41.862
That will only upset him
even more and make things worse.

00:17:41.987 --> 00:17:43.030
Sir.

00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:46.033
I barely make a living every day.

00:17:46.158 --> 00:17:48.619
He drives a fancy car
and buys fancy stuff.

00:17:48.744 --> 00:17:51.163
You should be on my side at least.

00:17:52.373 --> 00:17:53.541
Look.

00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:56.836
If you want anyone on your side,
get yourself an attorney.

00:17:56.961 --> 00:17:59.672
You think it's okay to blow up 100
million if he drives a fancy car?

00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:01.674
You think your money is precious,
but not for others?

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:05.929
Are you sure that porcelain is
really worth $100,000?

00:18:06.054 --> 00:18:08.890
Who knows if he broke it somewhere
else and blamed it on me?

00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:11.101
Who are you trying to frame here?

00:18:11.226 --> 00:18:12.895
Who's at fault here?

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.855
The police got the appraisal
statement from the gallery

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.190
and confirmed it was authentic.

00:18:16.315 --> 00:18:18.776
The victim purchased it
just an hour before the accident.

00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:20.778
He didn't break it anywhere else.

00:18:21.904 --> 00:18:23.197
Don't you

00:18:23.322 --> 00:18:25.324
think about saying that
to the victim, okay?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.368
- What then?
- Do you want to work it off?

00:18:27.493 --> 00:18:28.995
- How?
- Go to prison.

00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:32.123
Are you crazy? Why would I...

00:18:32.248 --> 00:18:33.917
If you can't work it off
or pay him,

00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:35.502
what do you want to do?

00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:37.796
Then

00:18:38.505 --> 00:18:39.923
what about those old people?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.598
How many old people
do you have at home?

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.892
My customers.

00:18:52.311 --> 00:18:55.189
(Happiness Diner)

00:18:57.066 --> 00:18:58.026
(Be happy with $1)

00:18:58.151 --> 00:18:59.652
I charge $1 for a meal.

00:19:00.987 --> 00:19:03.031
The food may look humble,

00:19:03.782 --> 00:19:06.326
but I make everything myself.

00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.870
So that I can give them more.

00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:10.580
If I hire anyone,
I can never afford it.

00:19:10.706 --> 00:19:11.832
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

00:19:11.957 --> 00:19:12.958
- See you.
- Bye.

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.627
To keep that price,
I have no time to sleep.

00:19:15.753 --> 00:19:17.504
To save every cost,

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:19.381
I've been attending
the morning market

00:19:19.506 --> 00:19:21.175
every Tuesday
for how many years now.

00:19:43.156 --> 00:19:45.158
- Are you okay?
- Move.

00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:54.377
Shoot.

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.337
Damn it!

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:57.880
No!

00:19:58.673 --> 00:20:01.092
Hey. How are you going to
make up for that?

00:20:01.217 --> 00:20:03.553
Why did you jump out of nowhere?

00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:05.138
This is crazy.

00:20:05.263 --> 00:20:07.140
You got money?
How are you going to pay for it?

00:20:15.732 --> 00:20:17.693
$1 for $10's worth of happiness.

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:20.863
Happiness Diner that protects
the neglected people.

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:22.448
That's what most articles said.

00:20:22.573 --> 00:20:24.283
Mr. Lee Kyung-hak's...

00:20:24.408 --> 00:20:26.661
I mean, the perpetrator's diner

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.120
almost received
the Minister's award,

00:20:28.246 --> 00:20:29.914
but one article said
he refused it.

00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:31.082
The Minister?

00:20:31.207 --> 00:20:33.876
He refused all TV show offers.

00:20:34.002 --> 00:20:35.670
Why refuse TV...

00:20:38.965 --> 00:20:40.842
He's still a perpetrator.

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:42.135
And the victim is firm.

00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:45.347
What are you doing?

00:20:45.847 --> 00:20:46.807
Okay.

00:20:51.937 --> 00:20:55.691
This could be real good.

00:20:57.818 --> 00:20:59.153
But he's the perpetrator.

00:21:00.196 --> 00:21:01.781
Keep up the good work.

00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:04.409
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:06.619
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:10.332
'Do that?'

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.626
What did he do?

00:21:14.044 --> 00:21:15.295
That pain in the ass.

00:21:23.304 --> 00:21:25.139
I thought you were
buying me coffee.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:26.807
Isn't it brilliant?

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:29.810
No one gets you the vending
machine coffee aside from me.

00:21:37.068 --> 00:21:38.987
About the Happiness Diner
incident.

00:21:39.696 --> 00:21:41.239
Was that yours at first?

00:21:41.364 --> 00:21:43.199
There's no yours or mine.

00:21:43.325 --> 00:21:45.744
I'm busy dealing
with drug dealers.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.996
Kiss my ass.

00:21:50.207 --> 00:21:52.292
But I think it's weird.

00:21:52.418 --> 00:21:53.794
Why did he take
such an expensive porcelain

00:21:54.378 --> 00:21:55.671
like that?

00:21:58.674 --> 00:22:00.092
Why didn't he do that?

00:22:06.182 --> 00:22:07.809
Something funny in there?

00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:09.477
Prosecutor Seo.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.105
It's not wrong to be ignorant.

00:22:12.605 --> 00:22:16.109
If I were him, I would've gotten
it delivered. It's expensive.

00:22:20.489 --> 00:22:21.323
Don't be like that.

00:22:21.448 --> 00:22:23.659
It's okay to ask your junior
if you're not competent.

00:22:25.452 --> 00:22:26.495
I did.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.876
And you answered my question.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.546
If I asked you straight up,

00:22:35.671 --> 00:22:36.672
would you have answered me?

00:22:38.174 --> 00:22:40.593
Change your attitude depending
on who you're dealing with.

00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:43.680
For example, our boss.

00:22:43.805 --> 00:22:45.765
She hates cheap lip service.

00:22:46.516 --> 00:22:48.894
Some don't know that's him.

00:22:55.901 --> 00:22:57.528
- Prosecutor Seo, you're...
- Prosecutor Seo.

00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:01.240
I found that expensive artworks
are normally delivered,

00:23:01.365 --> 00:23:03.743
so I printed it for you.

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:05.620
That way,
the insurance is applied...

00:23:08.706 --> 00:23:10.291
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes.

00:23:10.416 --> 00:23:13.294
Did you think I didn't know
about the special delivery?

00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:15.422
I'm sorry.

00:23:15.547 --> 00:23:16.840
Want a piece of advice?

00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:19.426
These days, the wobbling poppy
gets cut down,

00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:21.470
not the tall poppy. Got it?

00:23:21.887 --> 00:23:22.763
What?

00:23:27.017 --> 00:23:27.935
What are you doing?

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.395
Okay.

00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:37.778
He should've told me earlier.

00:23:56.465 --> 00:23:59.885
(Silver Theater)

00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:26.330
Not sure when they'll be
moving yet?

00:24:27.122 --> 00:24:28.665
We can't move without a supply.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.210
If you're avoiding the answer
on purpose,

00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:32.544
you'll be the first to go down.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:36.966
If I was going to avoid it,

00:24:37.091 --> 00:24:38.884
you think I would've called you
in the first place?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.663
Look at this.

00:25:06.997 --> 00:25:10.585
It expressed the quality of lights
in an extreme way.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.878
That's right.

00:25:12.003 --> 00:25:13.171
The artist said

00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:15.465
he was inspired by impressionism.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.258
Impressionism.

00:25:25.767 --> 00:25:26.935
(PARK YEONG HYI,
'God bless you', $54,000)

00:25:28.478 --> 00:25:29.479
Wow.

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:33.442
This

00:25:33.817 --> 00:25:35.611
calms me down.

00:25:36.195 --> 00:25:37.154
It feels

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.199
somewhat lonely though.

00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:42.869
What an insight.

00:25:43.995 --> 00:25:46.706
The artist expressed
hope and happiness

00:25:46.831 --> 00:25:50.877
comes from his children
despite the loss of his wife

00:25:51.002 --> 00:25:53.922
by painting layers.

00:25:55.298 --> 00:25:56.967
Is this still available
for purchase?

00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.059
Here is the contract.

00:26:05.893 --> 00:26:07.603
The price is 54,000 dollars.

00:26:07.728 --> 00:26:10.272
That is equivalent
to 71,000,000 won.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.817
Can I take the artwork
with me right away?

00:26:12.942 --> 00:26:15.611
I'm sorry, but artworks are

00:26:15.737 --> 00:26:17.071
affected by the environment,

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:18.865
and due to the damage risk,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.868
is it okay for us to deliver it?

00:26:21.993 --> 00:26:24.704
You're well aware
of the damage risk

00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:26.581
while moving.

00:26:26.706 --> 00:26:29.710
Even a single painting is moved
like treasure.

00:26:29.835 --> 00:26:31.962
I'm sure you care more
for porcelain?

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:34.339
Of course.

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:37.384
On October 24, Joo Jung-gi
purchased

00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:39.595
Moon Porcelain by Lee Eun Sang
from this gallery.

00:26:40.387 --> 00:26:43.808
Why wasn't it delivered
via special logistics service?

00:26:43.933 --> 00:26:44.767
Pardon me?

00:26:45.268 --> 00:26:46.394
Do you want to sign the--

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.104
Why did you tell your regular

00:26:48.229 --> 00:26:50.607
to take the artwork that was
worth $100,000 himself?

00:26:50.732 --> 00:26:51.816
What if it breaks?

00:26:53.026 --> 00:26:56.404
We'd never tell him
to take it himself.

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:58.573
Mr. Joo Jung-gi requested

00:26:58.698 --> 00:27:00.575
to take it himself that day.

00:27:02.327 --> 00:27:04.371
That day?
What about his previous purchases?

00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:07.082
We delivered everything else
via special logistics service.

00:27:07.207 --> 00:27:09.668
But he signed the contract
that he wouldn't blame us

00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:12.129
for any damage on Moon Porcelain.

00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:16.175
You can ask him yourself.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.818
It's not that I refused
the special delivery.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.737
It wasn't that far anyway.

00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:37.406
It was a hassle.

00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:38.741
If that was a hassle,

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:40.910
how did you receive all the other
ones via delivery before that?

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.954
You've always been thorough,
but you happened to be

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.331
stubborn that day
and got into an accident.

00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:48.042
What a coincidence.

00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:54.591
I'll tell you everything
since you're a prosecutor.

00:27:56.134 --> 00:27:57.093
Actually

00:27:57.635 --> 00:27:59.012
I'm a lawyer.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:01.973
We're called lawyers,
but you know,

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:04.059
we're basically businessmen.

00:28:04.184 --> 00:28:07.437
It's all about serving customers
and finding a good connection.

00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:09.857
You don't need to worry
about it

00:28:09.982 --> 00:28:12.651
because you're a public official.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.740
I do this to win their favor.

00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:20.618
I should give it to them
in person.

00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:23.037
Who goes through a delivery?

00:28:23.162 --> 00:28:25.415
Who were you trying to give it to?

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.501
I'm not obligated
to tell you that.

00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:31.087
It's nothing against the law.

00:28:31.213 --> 00:28:33.215
I didn't get to deliver it anyway.

00:28:33.882 --> 00:28:35.050
Anyway,

00:28:35.175 --> 00:28:38.053
what are you doing here?

00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:41.515
Do you think I got into
an accident on purpose?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.808
I was here to see the arts.

00:28:45.352 --> 00:28:46.604
Come on.

00:28:46.937 --> 00:28:50.316
I lost faith in my customer,
lost my money,

00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:51.484
and that wasn't enough,

00:28:51.609 --> 00:28:54.112
my prosecutor is suspecting me?

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:57.490
If you have time for that,

00:28:58.116 --> 00:29:01.786
go tell that jerk to pay me,
please.

00:29:34.154 --> 00:29:35.155
Sir.

00:29:35.822 --> 00:29:39.618
About the new prosecutor
in charge.

00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:41.578
Did he smell it too?

00:29:41.703 --> 00:29:44.415
Not that, but he keeps
getting on my nerves.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.125
His name is Seo Dong-jae
from Criminal Department 1.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.169
(Ehong Construction)

00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:49.879
- I know him.
- You do?

00:29:51.297 --> 00:29:53.466
I'll handle him.

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:54.801
Focus on your job.

00:29:59.973 --> 00:30:04.978
(Happiness Diner)

00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:10.108
No food today.

00:30:10.233 --> 00:30:11.485
No water.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.778
But I'm hungry.

00:30:12.903 --> 00:30:14.738
If you get no water, no food.

00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:19.076
Why aren't you

00:30:20.911 --> 00:30:21.954
open today?

00:30:22.455 --> 00:30:24.624
You need to work to pay me back.

00:30:39.765 --> 00:30:40.974
Are you inside?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.687
He tried to kill me.

00:30:47.481 --> 00:30:49.024
Don't come any closer.

00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:50.985
Do you know who I am?

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.653
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- You'll regret it.

00:30:52.778 --> 00:30:53.863
You'll regret it big time.

00:30:58.576 --> 00:30:59.577
Kiss my ass.

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:04.749
What happened?

00:31:08.587 --> 00:31:09.713
It's been out since this morning.

00:31:10.672 --> 00:31:13.258
I'm already upset to send
old people back home.

00:31:13.383 --> 00:31:14.801
Why did he have to
get on my nerves?

00:31:14.927 --> 00:31:16.345
What? The water outage?

00:31:17.096 --> 00:31:18.430
Is it out for the whole area?

00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:20.808
I'm not sure.

00:31:20.933 --> 00:31:22.518
There are only a few places left.

00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:27.940
Not easy running a business, huh?

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:30.109
Especially for you.

00:31:33.196 --> 00:31:35.782
Still, I owe this place.

00:31:37.867 --> 00:31:40.620
Everyone else left

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:43.457
because of their landlords.

00:31:45.292 --> 00:31:46.418
You see my wife.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.633
She supported everyone in need
around here.

00:31:54.301 --> 00:31:55.636
But she's gone now.

00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:59.056
She got sick
of the smell of the rice

00:31:59.182 --> 00:32:01.434
- and left me.
- Oh, no.

00:32:02.727 --> 00:32:04.771
I should've quit back then.

00:32:04.896 --> 00:32:05.814
But

00:32:06.689 --> 00:32:08.483
people kept coming.

00:32:08.608 --> 00:32:10.193
What could I do?
They were asking me for food.

00:32:10.318 --> 00:32:12.362
I decided to do it
for just one more day,

00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:14.239
and here I am.

00:32:15.282 --> 00:32:16.241
Right.

00:32:16.825 --> 00:32:19.411
Just one more day.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.790
And that continued until today.

00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:31.924
You're probably not here
for a meal.

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:36.387
I've thought about it.

00:32:36.513 --> 00:32:37.639
You should settle.

00:32:38.473 --> 00:32:39.307
Sir.

00:32:41.476 --> 00:32:44.187
That jerk insisted
on driving a fancy car

00:32:44.312 --> 00:32:48.317
while his car's getting fixed.

00:32:48.442 --> 00:32:49.735
So I'm paying for the rental.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.030
And you're telling me to pay him?

00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:54.114
Still,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.076
it's better than wasting
your precious money every day...

00:32:57.993 --> 00:32:58.953
Or

00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:01.038
how about going on TV?

00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:03.499
As a kind diner?

00:33:03.624 --> 00:33:06.878
No, just as how you look
right now.

00:33:07.003 --> 00:33:09.339
If you talk on TV

00:33:09.464 --> 00:33:11.508
and solve a quiz,

00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:14.469
you'll get a lot of sponsors.

00:33:14.594 --> 00:33:15.470
Forget it.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:17.973
You wish.

00:33:23.729 --> 00:33:24.647
Hello?

00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:26.774
Oh, yes.

00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:29.193
Right. My investigator called you.

00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:31.070
Yes.

00:33:32.572 --> 00:33:34.365
It's Happiness Diner
in Jangsung-dong.

00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:37.952
The water is out.

00:33:38.077 --> 00:33:39.412
He's unable to open.

00:33:39.537 --> 00:33:41.456
Please hurry up.

00:33:42.499 --> 00:33:43.875
Tomorrow morning?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.335
Thank you.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.378
Bye.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.548
Who was that?

00:33:51.133 --> 00:33:52.176
The Water Revenue Bureau.

00:33:53.051 --> 00:33:56.847
If you called them,
it would've taken days.

00:33:56.972 --> 00:33:58.265
But they're coming tomorrow.

00:33:59.642 --> 00:34:01.435
They said it must be something
about the drain.

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:04.188
- Is it in the yard?
- Dra...

00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:06.733
What drain?

00:34:08.818 --> 00:34:11.446
It's been fine for decades.

00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:13.615
This occurred
because it's decades old.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.824
Anyway,

00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:17.744
what do you say about going on TV?

00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:18.912
I said no!

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:23.333
Going to the police station
and the prosecutor's office

00:34:23.459 --> 00:34:24.752
was enough for me.

00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:28.505
Sir?

00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:32.176
If you're too shy to be on TV,
alone, I'll join you.

00:34:33.594 --> 00:34:34.595
Sir?

00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:36.305
Sir?

00:34:43.396 --> 00:34:45.482
Should I buy a grinder?

00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:50.028
I should've ground it a long ago.

00:34:56.452 --> 00:34:58.662
Why is he refusing to be on TV?

00:34:58.787 --> 00:35:00.247
Geez, he's not helpful at all.

00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:03.459
Geez.

00:35:04.543 --> 00:35:06.295
I'm going.

00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:10.717
Hey.

00:35:11.426 --> 00:35:13.928
What a temper.

00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.931
Huh? 3975.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.437
Hey, the porcelain accident.

00:36:01.562 --> 00:36:03.397
- I have the file--
- Still working on it?

00:36:04.732 --> 00:36:06.359
What was the license plate number?

00:36:06.484 --> 00:36:08.152
300 D 3975.

00:36:08.653 --> 00:36:10.279
300 D 3975.

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:19.998
Right.

00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:24.920
He almost ran into me
at 8:02 a.m..

00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:25.796
But the accident--

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.714
The accident occurred
at 8:10 a.m..

00:36:28.882 --> 00:36:30.175
It took place in the same spot.

00:36:31.677 --> 00:36:33.554
That's in front
of Happiness Diner.

00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:37.350
He went around in a circle
for 8 minutes.

00:36:39.143 --> 00:36:41.979
Hey, check the surveillance camera
before the accident occurred.

00:36:42.105 --> 00:36:43.272
I'm on it.

00:36:47.152 --> 00:36:48.737
(Happiness Diner)

00:36:56.703 --> 00:36:58.121
Hold on.

00:37:00.749 --> 00:37:02.000
(Conference Hall)

00:37:08.549 --> 00:37:09.592
Ma'am.

00:37:09.717 --> 00:37:10.635
Wait.

00:37:12.637 --> 00:37:15.014
It's a new kind of ecstasy
called Purple.

00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:18.142
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago

00:37:18.268 --> 00:37:20.687
and disappeared recently.

00:37:21.563 --> 00:37:22.731
Did they smell it?

00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:23.899
No, it's a simple supply issue.

00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:26.318
Not because they were worried
about us.

00:37:28.612 --> 00:37:30.030
How are you sure?

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.119
Ma'am.

00:37:35.244 --> 00:37:37.788
Remember Happiness Diner?
The good price diner?

00:37:37.913 --> 00:37:39.081
Are you still holding onto that?

00:37:39.206 --> 00:37:41.500
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.211
It wasn't an accident.

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:45.129
It's a case.

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:47.465
Something came out?

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.843
Oh, no. I found it.

00:37:49.968 --> 00:37:52.220
- I found it.
- So what did you find?

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:59.895
I'll tell you when it's certain.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.029
Did you find a free rider?

00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:10.531
Is someone on a free ride?

00:38:10.656 --> 00:38:11.866
Oh, yes.

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:15.495
It's not that there seems
to be a supply issue,

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.747
but declare that it is
a supply issue.

00:38:17.872 --> 00:38:19.374
To see you certain after a while,

00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:22.168
your informant must be reliable.

00:38:23.044 --> 00:38:24.754
You've seen too many movies.

00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:27.507
Have you ever been in charge
of a drug case before?

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.843
Why not?

00:38:29.968 --> 00:38:32.721
Violence, gang, drug

00:38:33.347 --> 00:38:34.556
are my specialty.

00:38:35.557 --> 00:38:36.725
Sure.

00:38:37.267 --> 00:38:39.728
'Sure.' You'll see.

00:38:40.855 --> 00:38:43.482
3975.

00:38:43.608 --> 00:38:45.484
Oh, 3975. Right here.

00:38:54.536 --> 00:38:55.662
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:38:58.623 --> 00:39:00.333
I boasted it to everyone.

00:39:00.459 --> 00:39:01.793
It's got to be there.

00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:04.421
(Recent)

00:39:06.256 --> 00:39:07.299
Yes.

00:39:09.635 --> 00:39:10.928
(Recent Destination,
Happiness Diner)

00:39:14.807 --> 00:39:16.100
What am I doing here?

00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:27.570
Sit down.

00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:41.252
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- Yes?

00:39:41.377 --> 00:39:43.546
Why did you leave the fine car
in the body shop?

00:39:43.671 --> 00:39:45.423
What? My car?

00:39:45.548 --> 00:39:47.216
What do you mean?

00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:49.135
It was all dented
when I hit the guardrail,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.179
and the tow truck towed it
in the scene.

00:39:51.304 --> 00:39:53.890
You haven't driven that car
since the accident

00:39:54.015 --> 00:39:55.558
on October 24, have you?

00:39:55.683 --> 00:39:56.851
No.

00:39:57.727 --> 00:39:58.728
Okay.

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:00.605
Watch this.

00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:05.736
1, 2, 3.

00:40:11.116 --> 00:40:13.953
Do you recognize your car?

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:15.955
What about it?

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.666
It's not illegal to take
the right turn and no accident.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:20.251
No problem.

00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:22.045
I know. What's the problem?

00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:31.179
The same road 4 minutes later.

00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:32.514
8:06 a.m..

00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:36.602
Then 4 minutes later at 8:10 a.m..

00:40:36.727 --> 00:40:38.478
What does that mean?

00:40:39.438 --> 00:40:40.773
It means you circled the road

00:40:40.898 --> 00:40:42.608
for 8 minutes.

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:43.692
Oh.

00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:48.948
Because I was lost.

00:40:49.073 --> 00:40:51.284
It was my first time going there.

00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:52.869
You later testified to him

00:40:52.994 --> 00:40:54.746
that you were on your way
to deliver a gift.

00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:57.373
- He did.
- Oh, yes.

00:40:57.499 --> 00:41:00.710
I was, but it was my first time
going there.

00:41:01.753 --> 00:41:02.837
Was it

00:41:03.213 --> 00:41:05.257
the owner of Happiness Diner

00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:06.800
you were trying to deliver
the gift to?

00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:10.929
The final destination in your GPS
just before the accident

00:41:11.054 --> 00:41:12.431
was Happiness Diner.

00:41:13.974 --> 00:41:18.562
(The day of the accident)

00:41:20.398 --> 00:41:21.482
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.569
You knew he unloads
the ingredients he bought

00:41:24.694 --> 00:41:26.946
from the morning market
at the same time every Tuesday.

00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:28.489
So you waited for your chance and

00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:29.616
boom.

00:41:31.743 --> 00:41:33.161
What? I can't even stop by
at a diner

00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:36.039
on my way to deliver
the porcelain?

00:41:36.164 --> 00:41:37.416
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:38.875
This is a fraud.

00:41:39.459 --> 00:41:40.586
And an aggressive deception.

00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:45.341
Fraud, my ass. I'm the victim.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.469
If this is how you want it,

00:41:48.594 --> 00:41:50.596
I'm taking it to court.

00:41:51.472 --> 00:41:53.891
Go ahead. So I can conduct
an official investigation.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.061
Prosecutor Seo.

00:41:57.186 --> 00:41:58.146
Now,

00:41:59.063 --> 00:42:01.274
it's up to you.

00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:04.736
A smooth settlement
with the diner owner

00:42:04.861 --> 00:42:06.112
or stand

00:42:06.822 --> 00:42:08.156
against the prosecutors.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.120
In fact, I've witnessed it myself.

00:42:16.874 --> 00:42:17.666
What?

00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:18.918
You almost got into an accident
while waiting for your chance.

00:42:19.043 --> 00:42:20.753
The car that was going straight.

00:42:22.088 --> 00:42:23.172
That was me.

00:42:24.882 --> 00:42:25.883
What are you...

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.262
Think carefully.

00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:43.485
Prosecutor Seo.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.154
You're absolutely amazing.

00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:48.115
The way you cornered him.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.825
I really want to learn it.

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:52.161
It's been so long

00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:54.455
since I've been
a temperamental senior.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.749
I'd forgotten about it

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.167
surrounded by juniors
that showed no reactions.

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:01.880
(Boss)

00:43:03.506 --> 00:43:04.924
Yes, boss.

00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:06.885
Now?

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.844
Yes.

00:43:08.762 --> 00:43:10.972
Sure. Yes.

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:30.201
Ma'am.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.869
It's me.

00:43:50.347 --> 00:43:52.141
You had a guest.

00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:55.019
You seem drunk.

00:43:55.144 --> 00:43:56.270
Are you okay?

00:43:56.395 --> 00:43:57.939
Oh, shoot.

00:43:58.064 --> 00:43:59.315
My head.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.067
You look good.

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:03.278
Oh, ma'am.

00:44:03.403 --> 00:44:04.904
Ma'am, you should lie down.

00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:06.948
Or are you

00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:09.409
paying less attention than before?

00:44:11.244 --> 00:44:12.162
Oh.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.748
You don't have my new
business card.

00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:17.251
Not your old one either.

00:44:20.254 --> 00:44:21.547
I'm from Ehong Construction.

00:44:23.799 --> 00:44:24.717
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

00:44:26.302 --> 00:44:27.845
How do you know my boss?

00:44:28.679 --> 00:44:32.058
You know what happens
when you run a business.

00:44:33.184 --> 00:44:35.853
Don't act like it's anything new.

00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:40.817
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

00:44:47.658 --> 00:44:51.203
Don't waste your energy
on a mere car accident.

00:44:51.328 --> 00:44:52.830
That diner will shut down anyway.

00:44:56.667 --> 00:45:00.379
And we'll no longer be
some rural construction company.

00:45:01.214 --> 00:45:03.049
(VIP CARD, Ehong Construction)

00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:10.807
What's the limit?

00:45:11.266 --> 00:45:12.350
How much do you expect?

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.061
When the diner soon shuts down,

00:45:15.187 --> 00:45:18.148
you'll no longer be
some rural construction company?

00:45:18.941 --> 00:45:20.567
I can't wait.

00:45:20.943 --> 00:45:21.819
I knew you'd understand.

00:45:23.195 --> 00:45:24.697
I didn't touch anything here.

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.740
We can talk about
the good old days with this--

00:45:26.866 --> 00:45:28.325
So what if it has no limit?

00:45:28.451 --> 00:45:29.869
It's expired.

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:31.913
I wouldn't give you
what's expired.

00:45:33.289 --> 00:45:34.582
This is old-fashioned.

00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:37.126
This is from a decade ago.

00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:39.754
Is this how you still play?

00:45:42.716 --> 00:45:44.718
Sorry for being old-fashioned.

00:45:44.843 --> 00:45:46.094
Please let off your steam

00:45:46.678 --> 00:45:49.556
and take it as delicious dinner
with your old brother.

00:45:53.894 --> 00:45:55.396
I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am.

00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:08.117
Shoot. It never dies away.

00:46:10.453 --> 00:46:12.872
What did your wife say?
Did she like it?

00:46:13.873 --> 00:46:15.083
Who is it today?

00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:16.960
I don't play a round
with just anyone.

00:46:17.085 --> 00:46:19.046
He's my good old friend.

00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:20.672
You can't take more than 10 steps

00:46:20.797 --> 00:46:22.132
without stepping on his land
in Chungcheong Province.

00:46:22.257 --> 00:46:23.801
He has no issues or anything.

00:46:23.926 --> 00:46:26.261
I just wanted to show off
with you next to me.

00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:30.307
You're nothing without boasting.

00:46:30.808 --> 00:46:33.185
Help me show off, will you?

00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:34.270
I don't know if I'm any good.

00:46:34.395 --> 00:46:35.354
You're here.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.192
This is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
I've told you about.

00:46:39.943 --> 00:46:40.902
Hi.

00:46:41.528 --> 00:46:42.779
I've heard a lot about you.

00:46:43.238 --> 00:46:44.364
My name is Nam Wan-seong.

00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:48.451
Did you drop my name again?

00:46:51.621 --> 00:46:52.664
You have a good friend.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.342
So? What's the trend these days?

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.098
How do they serve you these days?

00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:11.643
I'm darn curious.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.728
Forget about serving me.

00:47:13.853 --> 00:47:16.231
Why are you doing that
to Happiness Diner?

00:47:16.356 --> 00:47:17.440
Do you have a grudge against him?

00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:21.945
Now we're talking.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:25.199
Were you pretending earlier
in front of your boss?

00:47:28.035 --> 00:47:29.578
It's the profound secret.

00:47:30.496 --> 00:47:32.957
Guess who told me the secret.

00:47:34.208 --> 00:47:35.084
My boss?

00:47:35.209 --> 00:47:36.919
Legislation, jurisdiction,
and administration.

00:47:37.044 --> 00:47:39.297
For businessmen,

00:47:39.422 --> 00:47:41.799
secrets bring them money,
and that money

00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:43.676
comes from the legislation.

00:47:43.801 --> 00:47:45.428
- The national assembly?
- Do you want to go?

00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:46.596
To where?

00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:47.722
To the national assembly.

00:47:48.515 --> 00:47:50.350
I can send you there.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.811
Whatever.

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:56.023
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area.

00:47:56.148 --> 00:47:57.608
The diner site.

00:47:57.733 --> 00:48:00.778
No one knows that yet.
No one should.

00:48:00.903 --> 00:48:02.905
Because I'm going to buy
everything.

00:48:03.656 --> 00:48:05.074
But

00:48:05.199 --> 00:48:08.578
that poor old man won't sell
his house.

00:48:08.703 --> 00:48:09.954
No matter how much I offered.

00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:12.206
He refused it to death.

00:48:12.331 --> 00:48:15.793
I wondered if he heard something.

00:48:18.463 --> 00:48:20.632
You talk too much now.

00:48:20.757 --> 00:48:22.676
You had no guts to open
your mouth in front of me before.

00:48:27.514 --> 00:48:29.016
Because of that single place,

00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:31.143
it's causing me a great loss.

00:48:31.268 --> 00:48:32.019
Get off my car.

00:48:32.144 --> 00:48:35.314
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

00:48:35.439 --> 00:48:37.984
The national assembly
isn't 'whatever.'

00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:39.777
You think the jurisdiction is?

00:48:39.902 --> 00:48:40.945
You want me to show you?

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.697
Ms. Jeon!

00:48:44.824 --> 00:48:47.285
Why do you think
you got that case?

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.412
Afraid of the stubborn junior
smelling it,

00:48:49.537 --> 00:48:50.747
Ms. Jeon sent it

00:48:50.872 --> 00:48:53.250
to the biggest softie.

00:48:53.708 --> 00:48:54.709
But

00:48:54.835 --> 00:48:59.047
she got backstabbed
by the soft axe.

00:48:59.172 --> 00:49:01.133
Since when did
Cheongju Prosecutors' Office

00:49:01.258 --> 00:49:03.761
have so many sharp talents?

00:49:03.886 --> 00:49:06.263
I'm about to get disappointed
in Ms. Jeon.

00:49:06.388 --> 00:49:09.809
That won't do anything good
to her.

00:49:09.934 --> 00:49:11.727
Go deal with her yourself.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:17.734
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

00:49:17.859 --> 00:49:20.403
By paying her!

00:49:20.528 --> 00:49:22.113
If I just run my mouth...

00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:30.122
I'm not taking it for free.

00:49:30.247 --> 00:49:33.208
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:37.129
Only if

00:49:38.088 --> 00:49:39.757
you help me buy that house,

00:49:41.092 --> 00:49:42.969
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

00:49:44.178 --> 00:49:45.471
The same goes for me.

00:49:45.596 --> 00:49:46.514
Then we will all be

00:49:48.308 --> 00:49:50.143
happy, right?

00:49:51.561 --> 00:49:53.563
Your boss will be happy.

00:49:53.688 --> 00:49:55.190
I'll be happy.

00:49:55.315 --> 00:49:57.109
You'll be happy.

00:49:57.234 --> 00:49:59.569
And that old man will
be happy too.

00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:02.030
Good shot.

00:50:04.908 --> 00:50:06.910
Dive in for a good shot, will you?

00:50:10.956 --> 00:50:12.333
That lunatic.

00:50:25.263 --> 00:50:28.558
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area. The diner site.

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:32.688
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

00:50:32.813 --> 00:50:34.314
I'm not taking it for free.

00:50:34.439 --> 00:50:37.192
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

00:50:37.318 --> 00:50:39.028
Only if you help me
buy that house,

00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:43.532
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:44.825
Are you still holding onto that?

00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:47.036
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

00:50:57.005 --> 00:50:58.715
(Happiness Diner)

00:51:01.176 --> 00:51:02.386
Did he go home?

00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:12.396
I have to do what I have to do.

00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:22.156
Huh?

00:51:22.782 --> 00:51:25.368
Why is he fixing it when
the water bureau is coming?

00:51:27.704 --> 00:51:29.497
I knew he was too nice.

00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:58.174
Sorry about that.

00:52:58.299 --> 00:52:59.217
But

00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:03.263
you asked for it.

00:53:03.388 --> 00:53:05.974
Why did you call
the Water Revenue Bureau?

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.148
No one can hear you.

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:14.942
I told you everyone moved out.

00:53:51.939 --> 00:53:53.900
You don't need to pay him.
It wasn't a car accident.

00:53:54.025 --> 00:53:54.775
It was a fraud.

00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:56.527
The victim caused the accident
on purpose.

00:53:56.652 --> 00:53:59.113
But who's going to resolve it
without me?

00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:00.782
You can't help but fall for it.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:02.951
Look, prosecutor.

00:54:03.576 --> 00:54:06.454
Why do I need to resolve anything?
What's the purpose of this?

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.873
Are you taking off?

00:54:07.998 --> 00:54:09.416
You think that will be
the end of it?

00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:11.543
All that sneer and insult
you suffered from the victim.

00:54:11.668 --> 00:54:12.377
You think you can forget that?

00:54:12.502 --> 00:54:14.379
He had no idea about who you were.

00:54:14.505 --> 00:54:15.547
You need to teach him a lesson.

00:54:15.672 --> 00:54:18.133
- I'll kill him too.
- Why didn't you?

00:54:18.259 --> 00:54:19.343
You could've, but why not?

00:54:19.927 --> 00:54:21.512
Because you were stuck.

00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:23.806
The whole world knows
about the ruckus Joo Jung-gi made.

00:54:23.931 --> 00:54:25.808
If you kill him now,
you'll go straight to prison.

00:54:25.933 --> 00:54:27.977
But there is a way
to get back at him

00:54:28.102 --> 00:54:30.104
without killing him.
So why bother?

00:54:30.229 --> 00:54:31.147
I have evidence.

00:54:31.272 --> 00:54:33.566
Let's put him in prison for good
with fraud.

00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:34.484
Aren't you curious?

00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:36.528
That porcelain was really worth
$100,000.

00:54:37.696 --> 00:54:39.781
What matters is why he did it.

00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:50.459
Well...

00:54:51.293 --> 00:54:52.128
Yes.

00:54:52.795 --> 00:54:54.380
- Whatever.
- What?

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.049
No, sir.

00:54:57.175 --> 00:54:59.635
Where are you going to go
with this?

00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:01.095
Are you going to work
your ass off somewhere again?

00:55:01.763 --> 00:55:03.848
The office knows that I'm here.

00:55:03.973 --> 00:55:05.892
Are you going to wander around
with no home at that age?

00:55:06.434 --> 00:55:07.686
If you worked your ass off
running a diner against your will,

00:55:07.811 --> 00:55:10.188
you should be compensated.

00:55:11.231 --> 00:55:12.524
I can help you hit a jackpot.

00:55:13.984 --> 00:55:15.694
I'll help you make billions.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.113
That's what I'm here for.

00:55:19.448 --> 00:55:21.575
I'll make you a billionaire.
