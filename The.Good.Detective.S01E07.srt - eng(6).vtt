[Lee Dae Cheol's Interrogation Report]

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.350
Excuse me.

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.912
Detective Kang. I heard stories about you while I was in lock-up.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:51.032
Everyone said you're a nice man, a warm person.

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:53.179
Thank goodness.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.584
I'm glad someone like you is in charge of my case.

00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:58.334
I'm so grateful.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.486
Cut the nonsense.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.465
Just answer my questions truthfully.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:03.979
Of course.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.365
I will answer everything truthfully.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:11.706
I swear on my daughter that I will never lie.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.653
I don't think we need to be worried about the other side.

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:49.000
We just need the cops' stories to line up.

00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:54.864
Here.

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.833
I've already looked this over.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:05.289
Yes, but I wrote my side of the story there.

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:16.510
I was at the delivery office during that time.

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.590
You can go check. I'm telling the truth.

00:02:18.614 --> 00:02:19.778
For how long?

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:22.585
- How many people were there?
- I just believed what Nam Gook Hyeon said,

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.670
that he checked the CCTV footage at the delivery office.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.062
I should've gone there to check myself.

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:34.051
Why would I carry a knife with me? What for?

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:39.604
The knife that I carry with me is tiny and used for opening packages.

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:42.099
That's not the one I carry with me.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.729
I only focused on a premeditated crime.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:51.386
I should've checked the possibility of it being an accidental crime.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.450
You're saying I raped someone in the delivery truck and killed her?

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.146
I have to return the truck during that time.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.584
If I don't, the company checks.

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:05.624
I only called to confirm with the company

00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:10.596
and led them to answer in a way that I wanted them to answer.

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:16.442
Since I started living with Eun Hye, I've never even spat on the ground.

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:19.409
I was so ashamed of my past.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.925
Do you think someone like me can murder?

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.964
Two people, at that?

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:29.718
How could I look into my daughter's eyes, after doing that?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.181
I always look at Eun Hye's picture on my phone to stop myself from any bad habits.

00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:40.570
I tell myself that Eun Hye is always watching me.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.829
I thank her every time I open my phone.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.323
I thank her for being my daughter.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:54.734
I look at her picture and say that countlessly every day.

00:03:56.108 --> 00:03:58.043
It wasn't me.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.611
It wasn't me.

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:08.322
I would never... I would never do that to Eun Hye.

00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:12.982
I'm not a bad father.

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:17.847
I saw Lee Dae Cheol's heart at that moment.

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:21.898
But I ignored it.

00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:25.430
Because you're supposed to look at the case through the evidence.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.790
[I saw Lee Dae Cheol's heart at that moment. But I ignored it. Because you're supposed to look at the case through the evidence.]

00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:30.950
- Detective Kang.
- Yes?

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.968
This won't help much with the trial.

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.473
It's too subjective.

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:38.650
But still...

00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:42.579
Won't they take it into consideration?

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.675
I was able to confirm one important thing, though.

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:51.329
Detective Kang, the detective who arrested Lee Dae Cheol,

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.823
is confident that Lee Dae Cheol is innocent

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:57.315
with all his heart.

00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:59.650
This is good.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.386
We're prepared to win now.

00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:20.545
You can have some hope now.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.173
- Lawyer.
- Yes?

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:27.725
Please...

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.804
just let me die quietly.

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:33.312
Sorry?

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:50.770
Come here!

00:06:23.254 --> 00:06:25.103
Eun Hye...

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:35.862
- Stop the car for a minute.
- Why?

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:39.052
Just stop the car. Let's get some fresh air.

00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:41.112
I feel sick.

00:06:41.112 --> 00:06:43.651
Maybe I ate something bad earlier.

00:07:06.022 --> 00:07:08.389
Do you feel uncomfortable?

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.203
Do you feel sorry too?

00:07:10.203 --> 00:07:12.427
Why would I feel sorry?

00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:15.473
What else can I possibly do?

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:17.658
I've done all that I could.

00:07:17.658 --> 00:07:19.531
I can go see him on my own.

00:07:19.531 --> 00:07:23.867
Give me a second. I just feel a little nauseous.

00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:44.832
Since when?

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:46.607
What?

00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:49.881
When did you start thinking that I wasn't the killer?

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:53.115
You were so sure I killed them back then.

00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:56.163
- You see...
- Mr. Lee.

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:58.157
You must be mistaken.

00:07:58.157 --> 00:08:01.845
We're not certain that you're not the killer.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:04.948
It's just that we've found new evidence.

00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:07.732
And we're reinvestigating the case because we have concluded as detectives

00:08:07.732 --> 00:08:09.996
that the evidence is more than probable.

00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:14.372
If the evidence doesn't prove that you're not the killer during the retrial,

00:08:14.372 --> 00:08:17.569
we will accept the verdict.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.576
Yeah, right.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:25.944
But we're going to do everything we can.

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:29.290
We will find all the evidence that we can.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.790
That's enough. Forget it.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.345
Why are you refusing to go to trial?

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:37.407
I won't blame you, so stop.

00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:44.028
I've killed you and those bastard detectives multiple times in my dreams.

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.584
So that's enough, forget it.

00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:51.572
Just go and don't say anything more.

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:53.913
We see Eun Hye often.

00:08:54.744 --> 00:08:57.244
Your daughter, Lee Eun Hye.

00:08:57.861 --> 00:09:01.960
Don't worry. Detective Kang is taking good care of her.

00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:04.209
Lee Dae Cheol.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:08.213
Don't you think you need to see your daughter more?

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:12.777
I can't promise you that you will get released,

00:09:12.777 --> 00:09:17.854
but I will get you a reduced sentence at the very least.

00:09:17.854 --> 00:09:20.689
Then you'll be able to see Eun Hye. You can live to see Eun Hye.

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:22.413
Why?

00:09:22.413 --> 00:09:26.364
Why are you dragging my innocent Eun Hye into this? Why? Why?

00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:29.485
It was you, huh? It was all because of you!

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.709
It's your fault that Eun Hye was lying on the ground, huh?

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:35.388
- What are you doing?
- Tell me!

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:37.897
Why did Eun Hye end up like that, you bastard?

00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:41.133
Was it because of me?

00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:43.249
Just kill me instead!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.503
Why are you doing this?

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.159
Eun Hye asked me...

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:52.250
to save you.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.260
Please live.

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:03.391
For that child,

00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.145
you need to live, Lee Dae Cheol.

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:11.427
He's right.

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:13.863
It's fine. We'll take care of him.

00:10:18.848 --> 00:10:22.746
Have you gotten an update on Eun Hye recently?

00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:27.798
Who told you that Eun Hye is not doing well right now?

00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:32.021
No...

00:10:33.022 --> 00:10:35.722
I'm just worried about her. That's all.

00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:39.566
- Lee Dae Cheol.
- Don't ask me anything.

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:42.161
Just stop. Don't try to help me.

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.735
Detective Kang.

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:59.538
Yes? What is it?

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:04.308
Just grant me one thing.

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:06.331
What is it?

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.898
When Eun Hye gets married,

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:16.063
please walk her down the aisle for me.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:23.610
Then you will have done all that you need to do.

00:11:36.352 --> 00:11:38.633
It's because of Eun Hye.

00:11:43.867 --> 00:11:46.090
Do you know who Oh Jong Tae is?

00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:47.480
Yes, I do.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.738
Oh Jong Tae was approved to start an investment trust company six months ago.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.613
Did you know about that too?

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:56.024
Well, I did hear about it.

00:11:56.024 --> 00:11:59.569
An investment trust company is like a goose that lays golden eggs.

00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:03.600
But a man who has nothing to do with finance

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.122
was the only one to get approved for that business in Incheon.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:08.760
Why do you think that is?

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.459
Is it just because he's a resident of Incheon?

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:14.227
I come from a judicial background.

00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:17.445
I don't know much about finance and don't know anyone in that field.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:21.342
Geum Sang Ho was the commissioner of the Financial Services Commission at the time.

00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:25.428
You two are friends who did student protests together during the military regime.

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:28.789
You two went through a lot together.

00:12:29.751 --> 00:12:31.884
That's just a coincidence.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.613
Yeah.

00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:35.642
Got it.

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:51.550
As we expected, you were mentioned at the hearing regarding the business approval.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.276
And the chairman of the judiciary committee has ordered you to come too.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300
What am I supposed to do then?

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.289
Should I go into hiding?

00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:03.396
No. You can just refuse to show up.

00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:04.974
You won't be forced.

00:13:04.974 --> 00:13:08.817
You can just pay a fine later.

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:15.593
Law is a very scary thing for people who don't know much about it.

00:13:15.593 --> 00:13:19.442
But it's like nothing for people who do know.

00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:27.119
By chance... Have the police visited you regarding anything else?

00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:29.999
They have.

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:33.210
Was it regarding the death row inmate Lee Dae Cheol?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:33.947
Yes.

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:39.160
Have they found evidence that makes you look suspicious?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.771
I might get called in if they hold a retrial for Lee Dae Cheol.

00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:47.327
There was an incident that would make me look very suspicious.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.632
But I won't ever have to stand in court.

00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:52.952
Right?

00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:11.095
If we keep bowing to Oh Jong Tae, we'll end up being his puppets.

00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:12.956
There's nothing we can do right now.

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:15.594
Keeping his mouth shut is what's important right now.

00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:19.735
We should have some dirt on him.

00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:21.618
Find something.

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:27.212
I'm going to get him as soon as the hearing is over.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.270
Of course.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.662
Did you go to see your father recently?

00:14:49.662 --> 00:14:52.399
I've checked the prison's visitation record.

00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:56.347
Did you go see him often?

00:14:56.347 --> 00:15:00.016
So this was the first time you've seen him in five years.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.483
He's very worried about you, right?

00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:06.374
Of course, he is. What parent wouldn't be worried when their

00:15:06.374 --> 00:15:09.618
grown daughter falls to the ground every now and then?

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:11.518
He doesn't know about that.

00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:13.832
How would he know when I didn't tell him?

00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:16.268
He knows about it.

00:15:16.268 --> 00:15:18.105
How?

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.892
How does he know that?

00:15:19.892 --> 00:15:21.998
Good question.

00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:24.231
How could he have found out?

00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:26.796
[Witness]

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.092
I heard you refused to show up at first.

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:33.025
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:37.017
Someone told me that I would only have to pay a fine if I didn't show up.

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.887
What? This isn't some joke!

00:15:38.911 --> 00:15:43.320
But I found out that the fine is pretty expensive.

00:15:43.824 --> 00:15:46.991
Then, what is the nature of your relationship with Candidate Yoo?

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:51.543
Candidate Yoo said he met with your late father often

00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:54.929
but that he has never met with you.

00:15:56.499 --> 00:15:59.275
According to my memory,

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:03.226
I met him a few times at the golf course.

00:16:03.226 --> 00:16:06.963
- And I met him a few times at a bar too.
- Unbelievable.

00:16:06.963 --> 00:16:08.854
- Keep quiet!
- What does it mean?

00:16:08.854 --> 00:16:13.343
Okay. So Candidate Yoo has committed perjury.

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:15.282
- Right?
- What is he talking about?
- This can't be true.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.583
He may not remember it.

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:22.351
- I'm sure many people are chasing after him.
- Are you kidding me?

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:48.614
I did collapse once because of Park Hong Doo.

00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:51.516
He knows I go berserk when I get angry.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:53.291
That bastard.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.530
Who is it?

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:42.776
Who is it?

00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:45.568
What the fuck?

00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:47.592
Who did this?

00:17:48.149 --> 00:17:51.386
Hey, don't rip this off.

00:17:52.788 --> 00:17:55.288
You would be obstructing an officer.

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:07.436
What? I didn't do anything─

00:18:09.817 --> 00:18:11.744
Get up.

00:18:13.764 --> 00:18:15.661

00:18:28.652 --> 00:18:30.152
Hey.

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:32.276
- Did you do something wrong?
- Yes.

00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:33.967
What did you do?

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:36.996
Just everything.

00:18:42.317 --> 00:18:44.118
That's an insincere answer.

00:18:44.118 --> 00:18:46.678
Tell me exactly what you did wrong.

00:18:46.678 --> 00:18:48.060
Damn it!

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.611
This isn't like the old days! You can't beat me up like this!

00:18:51.611 --> 00:18:54.825
Just kill me then! Come on, kill me.

00:19:01.085 --> 00:19:03.677
Okay! Okay!

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:05.081
Let's go to the station.

00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:06.468
I'll talk to you there.

00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:08.453
- Why would we need to go to the station?
- What?

00:19:08.453 --> 00:19:10.543
Didn't you see the police line earlier?

00:19:10.543 --> 00:19:12.150
This is a crime scene.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.550
The body was found on...

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.860
January 8th at 12:40 (12:40pm).

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.304
The cause of death was excessive bleeding and severe brain injury.

00:19:20.328 --> 00:19:23.585
The first respondent was Detective Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Police Department.

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:28.600
He found the body while investigating juvenile prostitution.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.823
A-A-Are you kidding?

00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:35.405
Do detectives kid around like this?

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.412
Have a seat.

00:19:42.412 --> 00:19:46.917
Your late father, Chairman Oh Jeong Soo, took part in all the business dealings?

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:48.603
Yes.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.499
Then why did you meet with Candidate Yoo?

00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:54.863
Did you meet with him to ask for a favor?

00:19:54.863 --> 00:19:57.265
And you got special treatment from Candidate Yoo!

00:19:57.265 --> 00:19:59.498
You need to admit that!

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.519
To be honest, I met with him to ask him for a favor.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:12.102
But he flatly refused it.

00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:15.583
So I had to prepare more carefully.

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.939
In a way, he did help me

00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:20.561
to get the approval with my own skills and talents.

00:20:20.561 --> 00:20:24.288
The best finance people in the country have given up on that business.

00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:29.578
But a company with no experience in finance was able to get the approval.

00:20:29.578 --> 00:20:32.294
You think you were able to do that with just your skills and talent?

00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:37.480
As I've told you, my father created almost all of the structure.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.211
If we discover that any wrongdoing was committed during that process,

00:20:43.211 --> 00:20:50.224
I will give up on all of my business.

00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:04.912
He has proof

00:21:04.912 --> 00:21:06.907
and he's blackmailing us with it.

00:21:06.907 --> 00:21:10.962
I'm closer to the judicial system than he is.

00:21:10.962 --> 00:21:15.754
Even he knows that a few papers can't be enough to prove anything.

00:21:15.754 --> 00:21:16.628
And?

00:21:16.628 --> 00:21:22.202
If Oh Jong Tae announces one day that he is giving

00:21:22.202 --> 00:21:27.356
up on his huge business like he said today,

00:21:27.356 --> 00:21:31.208
he would be able to corner me even without any proof.

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:36.513
I believed that he would cooperate with us to protect his business.

00:21:36.513 --> 00:21:40.244
But he showed us that he could stab us in the back anytime.

00:21:40.244 --> 00:21:44.218
If he isn't protecting his money,

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.112
what do you think it is?

00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:49.946
I'll find out what it is.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:59.627
Regarding the confirmation hearing held by the national assembly,

00:21:59.627 --> 00:22:07.673

00:22:37.018 --> 00:22:38.218
I'm sorry.

Isn't that what the public likes?

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.296
A witness at the hearing for the Minister of Justice

00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.447

Okay.

Do you still think I'm the killer?

00:23:18.575 --> 00:23:20.884
You're just on the suspect list.

00:23:20.884 --> 00:23:22.960
We haven't narrowed it down to you.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.970
What do I need to do to get off that list?

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.607
Just don't do anything.

00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:30.540
I won't do anything if you don't do anything either.

Most of the cases that Lawyer So was in charge of were through Kang Do Chang.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.447
What if Lee Dae Cheol is found innocent

00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:02.866
and you're unable to find out who the real killer is?

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:06.042
No one will know why my husband died.

00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:07.841
You need to watch what you say.

00:28:07.841 --> 00:28:09.689
I'm going to catch the real killer no matter what.

00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:15.443
Can't you just let him get executed?

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.482
Would Jin Soo want that?

00:28:17.482 --> 00:28:21.414
He would want us to catch the real killer.

00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:26.097
Jang Jin Soo was a real detective.

00:28:27.775 --> 00:28:30.149
What the hell is a real detective anyway?

00:28:30.757 --> 00:28:34.340
Is it that amazing that someone would want to

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.096
remain a detective even after death?

00:29:23.338 --> 00:29:25.540
Slow down.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.461
Want me to slow down?

00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:32.330
He shouldn't drink all of it by himself.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.930
You should drink too.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.515
You need to join him, so he'll slow down.

00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:38.646
I'll die if I drink.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.120
Hi.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.011
I spoke to Detective Kang.

00:30:08.011 --> 00:30:11.126
I told him that he might not be considered to have died in the line of duty but─

00:30:11.126 --> 00:30:15.098
You don't need to think about anything else. The ruling won't get flipped anyway.

00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:19.230
Isn't Hyeon Joo done with tutoring soon? You should go pick her up.

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:21.847
Call me when you get back.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.043
Team Leader, I sent everyone out.

00:30:26.043 --> 00:30:28.105
- There should be no one in the room.
- Thanks.

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.822
You can take the day off tomorrow. You can report back the next day.

00:30:30.822 --> 00:30:33.518
Thank you, Team Leader!

00:31:28.163 --> 00:31:30.894
Stop!

00:31:30.894 --> 00:31:32.353
I'm drunk!

00:31:32.377 --> 00:31:33.530
Sorry about that.

00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:35.251
Ji Hyeok! Ji Hyeok!

00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:37.487
- Detective Kang!
- I love you!

00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:38.980
- You're drunk!
- I love you!

00:31:39.004 --> 00:31:41.290
Get in!

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.827
Go home! Don't go anywhere else!

00:31:43.827 --> 00:31:45.225
I love you, Detective Oh!

00:31:45.225 --> 00:31:48.158
Don't go somewhere else!

00:31:51.074 --> 00:31:52.749
- What an idiot.
- Such an idiot.

00:31:52.749 --> 00:31:54.258
What? Jinx.

00:31:54.258 --> 00:31:56.290
Right back at you.

00:31:57.353 --> 00:31:59.019
You should get going too.

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:00.573
I'll leave after I see you go.

00:32:00.573 --> 00:32:02.564
I'm going to drink some more by myself.

00:32:02.564 --> 00:32:05.762
It doesn't even feel like I drank because Detective Kang drank it all.

00:32:05.762 --> 00:32:07.203
Then let's go for another round.

00:32:07.203 --> 00:32:09.913
Why would I go for another round with someone who will die if he drinks?

00:32:09.913 --> 00:32:11.713
I like watching others drink.

00:32:11.713 --> 00:32:13.225
I'm good. Bye.

00:32:13.225 --> 00:32:16.450
I like paying for other people's drinks, too.

00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:19.949
Really?

00:32:30.645 --> 00:32:32.498
Another bottle of this, please.

00:32:32.498 --> 00:32:33.555
No.

00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:34.742
Why?

00:32:34.742 --> 00:32:36.040
You're regretting it now?

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.717
Get us the 25-year-old one instead, please.

00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:38.601
Sure.

00:32:38.601 --> 00:32:40.823
The hangover won't be as bad.

00:32:40.823 --> 00:32:44.680
What do you know about drinks when you don't even drink?

00:32:48.614 --> 00:32:52.751
You know that Jong Tae was at the hearing for the Minister of Justice, right?

00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:55.517
Yoo Jeong Seok met with Oh Jong Tae because─

00:32:55.517 --> 00:32:59.812
Oh Jong Tae is Candidate Yoo Jeong Ryeol's Achilles heel for

00:32:59.812 --> 00:33:02.940
They were trying to get their story straight before the hearing.

00:33:03.698 --> 00:33:07.469
Does Senior Manager Yoo know that we're going after Jong Tae?

00:33:07.469 --> 00:33:09.557
Yes. I told him.

00:33:09.557 --> 00:33:11.690
Does he want us to go after him?

00:33:15.267 --> 00:33:18.752
Did we get more evidence that shows Oh Jong Tae is the killer?

00:33:18.752 --> 00:33:20.030
Why?

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.138
Did your boss ask you to find out?

00:33:22.138 --> 00:33:27.581
He has to shield him since he is his brother's Achilles heel.

00:33:35.494 --> 00:33:38.628
My boss is not someone who would do that.

00:33:38.628 --> 00:33:42.705
He's someone who would do his duty as a journalist no matter what.

00:33:43.392 --> 00:33:44.293
He would never.

00:33:44.317 --> 00:33:46.017
Really?

00:33:46.017 --> 00:33:47.845
You trust him?

00:33:51.001 --> 00:33:52.251
What the heck?

00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:54.577
Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated?

00:33:54.577 --> 00:33:58.931
Are you trying to get me drunk to get information from me?

00:33:58.931 --> 00:34:02.720
Were you lying when you said you would die if you drink?

00:34:10.021 --> 00:34:11.862
What are you doing?

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.782
So you were lying.

00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:24.399
You're fine.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.476
He passed out all of a sudden!

00:34:29.476 --> 00:34:31.643
Is he unconscious right now?

00:34:31.643 --> 00:34:33.418
Oh no!

00:34:33.418 --> 00:34:35.407
He was definitely breathing but he wouldn't wake up

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.425
no matter how hard I tried to wake him!

00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:42.006
He really only had one drink. How can someone just...

00:34:45.706 --> 00:34:47.157
What's wrong?

00:34:47.157 --> 00:34:50.521
What is it? Is he really about to die?

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:54.809
His blood pressure is normal, and there are no heart rate or breathing issues.

00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:55.802
Okay.

00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:59.155
I think he's asleep.

00:34:59.728 --> 00:35:01.028
What?

00:35:03.065 --> 00:35:04.710
He's asleep?

This footage is what triggered Kang Do Chang.

00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:28.133
- Who sent it?
- I don't know.

00:35:28.133 --> 00:35:33.358
Have you... seen this before, too, Detective Nam?

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:37.739
No.

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:41.213
If I had seen this back then, things would have turned out very differently.

00:35:41.213 --> 00:35:43.137
Whose computer was this on?

00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:44.453
Sim Dong Wook's, sir.

00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:49.685
So the whole team has been on it.

[Chief Moon Sang Beom]

00:35:52.983 --> 00:35:57.950
You know that this isn't enough to flip everything, right?

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.135
Yes, sir.

00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:01.143
Let's keep this quiet.

00:36:01.143 --> 00:36:02.585
Yes, sir.

00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:04.930

[November 9, 2015, 6 days after Yoon Ji Seon's body was found]

And he works for almost three more hours after that.

00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:32.114
When we look at the time the body was disposed of,

00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:36.015
there's almost zero chance that Lee Dae Cheol was the killer.

00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:39.015
That might be someone who looks like Lee Dae Cheol.

00:36:39.015 --> 00:36:41.981
Everyone looks the same in delivery uniforms.

00:36:41.981 --> 00:36:43.261
Come on, that's Lee Dae Cheol.

00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:46.870
I've confirmed it more than a hundred times.

You have to tell him.

00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:13.226
Nope.

00:37:14.582 --> 00:37:18.883
Lee Dae Cheol is the killer.

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:23.415
He's the killer.

Don't you have to drive, though?

Hey, Park Dong Cheol!

That's my sister.

00:41:28.449 --> 00:41:33.392
I slept without dreaming for the first time in a long time thanks to you.

00:41:35.319 --> 00:41:37.755
- You were really sleeping?
- Yes.

00:41:37.755 --> 00:41:39.869
Are you sure you're human?

00:41:39.869 --> 00:41:41.516
No.

00:41:41.516 --> 00:41:44.035
This isn't something that happens to humans.

00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:47.376
It happens to people who have insomnia.

A small stimulus puts them to sleep as if they're dead.

Insomnia?

00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:54.109
I thought only those who use their brain cells a lot get that.

00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:56.876
You don't use your brain a lot.

00:41:56.876 --> 00:41:58.174

This is nice.

00:42:04.413 --> 00:42:07.855
I feel so refreshed after that deep sleep. This is really nice.

00:42:07.855 --> 00:42:10.121
Let's have a drink again later.

Do you like bone soup or blood sausage soup? I like blood sausage.

How did this get leaked?

I don't know.

00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:31.215
But I am certain that the lawyer has this video.

This is going to complicate things.

How are you handling your files?

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.606
Prosecutor, we weren't the only ones who had the file.

00:42:40.606 --> 00:42:43.827
That file was handed to the prosecutions back then too.

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:45.828
I got it.

00:42:45.828 --> 00:42:49.296
Just make sure no other file gets leaked.

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:53.960
If we lose this case, that will be the end of both of our careers.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.338
You know that, right?

00:43:00.218 --> 00:43:02.930
The prosecutor has been selected.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.502
It's Prosecutor Jeong Sang Il. You know him, right?

00:43:05.502 --> 00:43:07.270
He was the prosecutor in charge back then.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.916
I thought he got in trouble and was sent to Jeju. Why him?

00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:13.564
The prosecution is cheating.

00:43:13.564 --> 00:43:17.579
Jeju District Office sent him to Incheon as a dispatch.

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:22.613
They're showing us that they're going to do everything they can to win.

00:43:22.613 --> 00:43:24.922
We got the date for the trial too.

00:43:24.922 --> 00:43:29.884
We pretty much have what we need for the first trial.

But the problem is Lee Dae Cheol.

00:43:33.674 --> 00:43:36.717
Were you able to convince him?

00:43:37.287 --> 00:43:38.771

I'm the one who filmed Eun Hye's video.

Someone paid me to film her.

00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:11.545
But it's not because I did something to her. She has an illness!

00:45:11.545 --> 00:45:13.820
She has a seizure when she gets worked up.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.738
Did you make her have a seizure on purpose?

00:45:17.738 --> 00:45:18.950
Yes.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.062
But I know about Eun Hye's illness very well.

00:45:22.062 --> 00:45:24.462
She's fine once the seizure is over.

00:45:24.462 --> 00:45:26.511
It's only temporary.

Yes, Ji Seon and I got a lot of our tools delivered from overseas, so we saw him often.

What did you think of the relationship between Ms. Yoon and the defendant?

It is true that he paid special attention to Ji Seon, unlike other delivery men.

Was there a reason he started paying special attention?

"While making his delivery, Lee Dae Cheol fell in

love with Yoon Ji Seon who was wearing a tank top.

00:49:44.245 --> 00:49:47.551
And he kept coming to her drunk asking her to have drinks with him.

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:50.737
When Yoon Ji Seon rejected him, he snuck into the

studio and stole her underwear and stalked her.

00:49:54.233 --> 00:49:57.172
On the day of the murder, he snuck into her studio

00:49:57.172 --> 00:50:00.950
and forced her into his delivery truck and tried to rape her.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.466
When he failed, he choked her to death."

And I've never seen Ji Seon wear a tank top.

But for some reason, it was not selected as evidence at the trial five years ago.

The person in the video is Oh Jong Tae.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:07.702
Yoon Ji Seon, who was an art student at the time, painted a portrait for Oh Jong Tae.

00:52:07.702 --> 00:52:12.837
Afterward, the two went to New York together and maintained a close relationship.

00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:15.296
This video was presented as proof that Oh Jong Tae was

00:52:15.296 --> 00:52:17.628
at a hotel in Busan at the time of the body disposal.

00:52:17.628 --> 00:52:23.137
And he was excluded from the investigation altogether with this video.

00:52:23.137 --> 00:52:27.240
But after asking an expert about this video,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.853
we established that the time code was manipulated by filming

00:52:31.853 --> 00:52:35.991
the original video with another camera to fabricate his alibi.

00:52:40.368 --> 00:52:41.710

But have you inquired about the first footage for fabrication?

00:52:59.893 --> 00:53:03.002
You're only looking at one side, don't you think?

Don't worry, I'll keep my promise.

00:53:20.942 --> 00:53:25.043
Since you already started it, I hope you win.

Do you really mean that?

00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:31.365
Do you think I only care about myself?

00:53:31.365 --> 00:53:35.685
I don't have the courage to live like you and don't feel the need to do that.

00:53:35.685 --> 00:53:41.750
But I think the police need people like you too.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:48.733
But I also don't think you have the right to criticize officers like me.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.955
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West Division.

00:54:13.955 --> 00:54:16.655
I'm the one who left the message.

00:54:16.655 --> 00:54:18.379
Oh, really?

00:54:18.379 --> 00:54:24.591
I'm sorry, but could we meet at that location?

00:54:24.591 --> 00:54:28.046
Yes, where Oh Jong Tae was caught.

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:29.965
Okay.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.536
Where Oh Jong Tae was caught?

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:37.957
[Novenber 3, 2015 at 03:30 (03:30am)]

00:55:29.961 --> 00:55:31.842
You've crossed the center line.

00:55:31.842 --> 00:55:34.099
Please show me your license.

00:55:37.832 --> 00:55:40.577
You must've been in a great hurry.

00:55:42.485 --> 00:55:44.085
What?

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:46.447
What did you just say to me?

00:55:46.447 --> 00:55:49.399
I said I admit to crossing over the center line!

00:55:49.399 --> 00:55:52.356
Just give me the ticket and let me go!

00:55:55.244 --> 00:55:57.144
Have you been drinking?

00:55:57.617 --> 00:55:59.217
What?

00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:06.328
The car was over there.

00:56:06.328 --> 00:56:10.683
And he made an illegal U-turn from there.

00:56:10.683 --> 00:56:12.448
What happened to him after that?

00:56:12.448 --> 00:56:15.714
We took him to the station for driving under influence.

00:56:17.966 --> 00:56:19.509
Blow.

00:56:22.592 --> 00:56:24.026
Step out of the car.

00:56:24.026 --> 00:56:25.133
And the car?

00:56:25.133 --> 00:56:27.500
We left it parked at the scene.

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:33.211
He probably came back for it later.

00:56:33.211 --> 00:56:37.460
The site where the body was disposed of is about 13 km from here.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.747
About ten minutes by car.

00:56:38.747 --> 00:56:44.647
So this proves that Oh Jong Tae was near the scene of the crime on that day.

00:56:44.647 --> 00:56:46.314
Yes.

00:56:47.158 --> 00:56:53.977
I wonder why he made a U-turn and tried to go back to the crime scene.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.267
He must've dropped something important at the crime scene.

00:56:59.267 --> 00:57:00.978
Like what?

[Death row inmate Lee Dae Cheol's lawyer claims the investigation was poorly conducted]

00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:21.574
The trial is getting a lot of attention, so we had to write about it.

00:57:21.574 --> 00:57:24.447
Yes, I checked the article beforehand.

00:57:24.447 --> 00:57:26.557
I've concluded that it was written objectively.

00:57:26.557 --> 00:57:30.002
I'm not saying there's something wrong with the article.

00:57:30.002 --> 00:57:34.104
I'm just saying it was a bit much from my point of view.

00:57:34.104 --> 00:57:36.072
Your name hasn't been reported yet,

00:57:36.072 --> 00:57:37.962
so I don't think you need to worry.

00:57:37.962 --> 00:57:40.986
It will get handled, right?

00:57:40.986 --> 00:57:44.908
As long as you don't cross the line.

00:57:44.908 --> 00:57:50.233
By the way, congratulations to your brother for becoming the new minister of justice.

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:53.841
I hope he stays in that seat for a long time.

00:57:53.841 --> 00:57:56.447
Yes, thank you.

00:58:06.766 --> 00:58:09.666
You didn't edit my article that much.

00:58:20.192 --> 00:58:22.292
Hello.

00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:24.122
Long time no see.

00:58:24.122 --> 00:58:25.805
It's been five years, right?

00:58:25.805 --> 00:58:27.105
Yes.

00:58:27.748 --> 00:58:33.141
I thought we were never supposed to see each other again.

00:58:33.141 --> 00:58:34.653
Excuse me?

00:58:38.042 --> 00:58:40.642
Why did you make that mistake?

00:58:42.276 --> 00:58:43.776
Why?

00:58:45.192 --> 00:58:47.014
I'm sorry.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.666
Did you ask someone to auction this off, recently?

00:58:56.628 --> 00:59:00.911
This is the receipt of the payment that was made to your account.

00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:05.630
The auction price was 800M won (~$800,000) minus the commission fees.

00:59:07.093 --> 00:59:08.176
And?

00:59:08.176 --> 00:59:10.158
Where did you get this watch?

00:59:10.158 --> 00:59:11.858
That─

00:59:14.938 --> 00:59:17.439
Why do I need to tell you that?

00:59:17.439 --> 00:59:19.817
I just sold something that I had.

00:59:19.817 --> 00:59:23.424
It's a watch that the suspect was wearing.

00:59:23.424 --> 00:59:24.351
What?

00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:28.085
It disappeared after the murder five years ago.

00:59:28.085 --> 00:59:31.227
Why was this watch in the hands of Detective Jang's wife

00:59:31.227 --> 00:59:35.057
whose husband was in charge of the case back then?

00:59:35.057 --> 00:59:39.360
If we find out that Detective Jang stole an important piece of evidence,

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.941
his death classification will be canceled,

00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:45.152
as you had feared, and he will be charged with corruption.

00:59:50.025 --> 00:59:52.658
You just need to tell us the truth.

00:59:52.658 --> 00:59:55.558
Who gave you this watch?

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.675
Was it Jin Soo?

01:00:02.977 --> 01:00:05.164

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:40.651
It rained a lot last night, so most of the stuff got swept away.

01:00:40.651 --> 01:00:44.318
I'm going to go to the station and identify the victim.

01:00:44.318 --> 01:00:46.620
You stay here and search the surrounding a bit more.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.044
Yes, sir.

01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:52.451
Bye.

01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:39.858
Can you testify in court to what you've just told us?

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:45.725
Jin Soo is Hyeon Joo's father.

01:01:46.207 --> 01:01:49.747
We should make sure he doesn't get falsely accused.

01:02:08.584 --> 01:02:10.458
I'll do it.

01:02:11.163 --> 01:02:13.056
I'll testify.
