00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:24.168
Could you please step out of the car?

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:25.393
What's this about?

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:27.332
Are you the pastor of Gawol Church?

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:31.864
- Yes, I am.
- I would like to speak to you.

00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:35.332
Give me one minute.

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:54.718
May I ask who you are? I don't think we've ever met.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.284
Jo Seong Gi.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.434
I know you're Jo Seong Gi.

00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.981
I'm not Jo Seong Gi.

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:04.418
I've never forgotten you, not even for a second. Your name.

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.303
Your face.

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:07.418
Who are you?

00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:09.121
Yoo Jeong Seon.

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.228
- You remember her, right?
- Who is that?

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:15.984
I don't know anyone by that name.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:17.426
Who is Yoo Jeong Seon?

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.758
Go to the police and admit it.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.615
Admit that you're Jo Seong Gi

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:29.812
and that you tortured and raped Yoo Jeong Seon, which led to her death.

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.819
There's nowhere left for you to run.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.920
Please.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:37.055
Hey.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.051
I said it's not me.

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:41.564
Turn yourself in!

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:44.712
Or else I don't know what I will do.

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:49.957
Who the hell are you?

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.723
How dare you threaten me, you bastard?

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:56.530
You killed my sister. You!

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.356
Be quiet.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.180
Why did you do it?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.996
Why did you do that to my sister? Bastard!

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:05.739
Are you her brother?

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.306
I will never forgive you.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:09.723
Never!

00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:14.181
I said, be quiet. You're going to wake everyone up.

00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:26.647
Hey, I'm not the one who killed her.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.903
She hung herself.

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:31.175
Why are you blaming me?

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:35.350
She's dead because of you.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.611
It's your fault!

00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:47.069
I didn't do anything to her.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.854
She raised her skirt herself,

00:02:51.568 --> 00:02:53.168
asking me to let her go.

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.195
What a hassle.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:00.094
I was finally beginning to settle down.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.113
You're a piece of trash.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:13.959
Excuse me!

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.882
I thought I heard people fighting over here.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.733
Did you hear anything?

00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:26.483
Yes, I was talking on the phone.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.411
I was shouting because I was angry.

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.504
Are you the owner of this car?

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:33.928
Yes.

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:39.358
Did something happen?

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:41.660
No, nothing happened.

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:47.543
I'm Detective Jang Jin Soo from violent crimes at Incheon's West Police Department.

00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:50.910
Could you please open the trunk for me?

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.234
Sure.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.270
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.119
Where are you?

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.443
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.129
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:45.607
What do I need to explain?

00:05:45.607 --> 00:05:47.298
The truth.

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:49.271
The truth?

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:54.344
I... only killed someone who deserved to die.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:02.192
Senior Manager...

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:04.682
Do you mean that?

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:09.192
Didn't you all speculate on it based on how things have been going?

00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:12.481
- Senior Manager.
- Unless I tell you otherwise,

00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:15.009
just keep working on your assignments.

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:19.253
Senior Manager!

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.244
Good job on bringing it this far.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.515
[Jin Seo Kyeong]

00:06:57.175 --> 00:06:58.509
What should we do?

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.225
- You choose.
- What?

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:05.648
Tell the truth about what happened and receive a sentence.

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:07.457
If you don't want to do that,

00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:09.262
then keep saying that you didn't do it.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:13.258
I'll do whatever it takes to bury it.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:27.262
If Senior Manager Yoo reaches out first, you'll probably be the one he calls.

00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:30.974
We have to break the story through our paper before the police do.

00:07:30.974 --> 00:07:35.096
That's the only way to save our newspaper.

00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:38.923
But if you're not able to persuade Senior Manager Yoo to do it,

00:07:38.923 --> 00:07:41.471
we have to release the story on our own.

00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:45.440
We won't be able to handle the mess if the police announce it first.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.364
Shouldn't we give Senior Manager Yoo some time?

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:51.643
We need to find out why he committed murder.

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:54.416
And he's our boss after all.

00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:57.479
He was our boss until he told us that he had killed someone.

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:00.087
He's not our boss anymore.

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:04.565
If he hadn't brought you to the headquarters,

00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:06.761
he would probably still be our senior manager.

00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:09.494
And he would've continued being our senior manager.

00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:14.500
Attention everyone! From now on, report everything to me.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.354
Don't mention anything about the search warrant until Senior Manager Yoo talks about it first.

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:19.854
Okay.

00:08:22.346 --> 00:08:25.146
Good job on bringing it this far.

00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:33.018
This is what we got from restoring the deleted files from Yoo Jeong Seok's computer.

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:37.080
He had a separate folder for Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.456
He saved articles from other papers, news clips, and even trial records.

00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:50.088
That can serve as circumstantial evidence that Yoo Jeong Seok was involved in the case.

00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:53.885
The fact that he deleted that folder must mean

00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.300
- that he has something to hide.
- Correct.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.202
And the folder was deleted the day Jo Seong Gi's remains were found.

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:04.673
So Yoo Jeong Seok is the one who killed Jo Seong Gi.

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:07.588
Anything else that's interesting?

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:13.230
The audio file of Chief Moon and Prosecutor Jeong was stored on his hard drive.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.435
We've confirmed that Yoo Jeong Seok is the one who shared the video of

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:22.372
Jo Byeong Gil going on a rampage, the inmate who was executed with Lee Dae Cheol.

00:09:22.372 --> 00:09:25.330
So that proves Yoo Jeong Seok shared it on purpose

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.206
to make the people favor the execution.

00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:31.057
He supported an execution just to kill Lee Dae Cheol?

00:09:31.057 --> 00:09:33.559
The educated guys are more evil.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:36.815
This means that our search and seizure was worth it.

00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:39.542
Was there any folder for Jang Jin Soo?

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:42.496
I didn't see anything about Jang Jin Soo's trial records,

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:45.901
but it seems like he paid special attention to Team Leader Nam.

00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.210
He saved everything from his identification record,

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.517
his past case files, and what he has been up to currently.

00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:53.993
But why? Why?

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:57.817
Why is Yoo Jeong Seok interested in Nam Gook Hyeon?

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:03.135
I believe I've done everything I could for you.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.868
There's nothing more I can do for you.

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.869
Why are you doing this to me too?

00:10:06.869 --> 00:10:11.393
It won't do you any good to push me into a corner.

00:10:11.393 --> 00:10:13.415
Are you saying you're going to drag me into this?

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:17.320
You're involved in my story.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.962
We need to make sure neither of us get hurt.

00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:24.242
Can I give you a piece of advice?

00:10:24.242 --> 00:10:26.072
Yoo Jeong Ryeol has let go of your hand too.

00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:28.829
You have nowhere to go.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.781
Just go in for conspiracy to murder.

00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:33.518
- That's your best option.
- Me?

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:36.163
I have to go to prison?

00:10:36.163 --> 00:10:41.360
Why should I have to go where those rotten parasites are gathered?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.845
Why?

00:10:42.845 --> 00:10:44.167
Huh?

00:10:44.798 --> 00:10:46.198
Why?

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:48.909
Listen to me.

00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:50.654
CEO Oh.

00:10:57.804 --> 00:10:59.404
Let go of me!

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:02.266
Let go of me!

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.943
I don't get it.

00:11:20.943 --> 00:11:24.707
How come people like you don't know how to be thankful?

00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:29.866
You would shake your tail like a quiet dog when I fed you,

00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:33.009
and then you go and stab me in the back.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:35.494
My father gave you money, I gave you money.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:39.677
If you've got a conscience, you should do whatever I tell you.

00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:41.468
CEO Oh.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.488
CEO Oh, I─

00:11:43.488 --> 00:11:44.792
Did everything you could?

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.849
I've done everything I could.

00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:50.397
Well, I can't say that you didn't.

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:52.270
Okay.

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:56.629
I'll take your advice and go in for conspiracy to murder.

00:11:56.629 --> 00:12:01.510
But I need you to keep your mouth shut.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.706
It will complicate things for me if you talk.

00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:08.943
I won't say anything.

00:12:08.943 --> 00:12:10.987
There's no reason for me to.

00:12:10.987 --> 00:12:13.074
You've covered something for me, too.

00:12:13.074 --> 00:12:15.341
Oh, that's right.

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:20.639
But it would be okay for you to say it to one person.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.545
Lee Dae Cheol.

00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:27.763
When you see him, tell him that he should be honored that he died in my place.

00:12:27.763 --> 00:12:29.528
Wait!

00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:35.110
The one who killed Jang Jin Soo

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.290
is Yoo Jeong Seok!

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.529
I know that too.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.785
Why are you bringing that up?

00:12:41.785 --> 00:12:43.835
I saw him!

00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:47.100
There's evidence that proves Yoo Jeong Seok

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.350
killed both Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo.

00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:58.750
Why are you telling me that just now?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.655
I'll give it to you.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.548
Use it to blackmail Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:09.251
Then you'll find a way out of this.

00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:10.291
What kind of evidence?

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.515
It's a dashcam video of the murder.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:22.248
Why did you hide that from me?

00:13:22.248 --> 00:13:27.270
If I were accused of killing Jang Jin Soo

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.470
then I was going to use it.

00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:35.289
I missed.

00:13:36.034 --> 00:13:39.491
But I won't miss next time.

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.537
Clean this up.

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:52.073
He hasn't used his card for the whole month.

00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:55.119

- Yes?

00:29:08.114 --> 00:29:10.969
I'm really exhausted right now. Can we do this tomorrow─

00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:13.059
You're too tired to do this?

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:15.163
Jae Woong's and my life depend on this.

00:29:15.163 --> 00:29:17.026
Sure. That's true.

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:21.494
Look. We can't win with finances.

00:29:21.494 --> 00:29:22.859
But there's one way.

00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:25.585
We'll take the upper hand if we find evidence that proves

00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:28.381
Jae Woong's dad committed adultery before the divorce.

00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:31.795
How would we find that kind of evidence now?

00:29:31.795 --> 00:29:35.397
Come on, my brother is a detective.

00:29:35.397 --> 00:29:38.361
Of course, I prepared the evidence.

00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:42.756
So, this is his credit card history from before the divorce.

00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:48.443
If we look into the card history and check the CCTV footage of where it was used,

00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:49.788
we'll find something.

00:29:49.812 --> 00:29:53.055
My goodness. Check everything on here?

00:29:53.055 --> 00:29:53.945
Yeah.

00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:56.008
Sky Lounge, Sky Lounge...

00:29:56.008 --> 00:29:58.665
- Everything on here?
- Yes!

00:30:03.337 --> 00:30:04.937
Hello?

00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:07.533
Really? Okay, I'll be right there.

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:09.000
Bye.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.626
It's an emergency. I need to go.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.868
Oppa, Oppa, you need to come home right away when you're done!

00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:18.698
Oppa! Let me reap some benefits of having a detective as a brother!

00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:20.350
Yeah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.015
Okay.

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:28.329
We have enough to prove that Nam Gook Hyeon fabricated and destroyed evidence.

00:30:28.329 --> 00:30:30.228
Yeah.

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:34.758
If you see him before I get there,
read him his charges and arrest him.

00:30:34.758 --> 00:30:35.881
Okay.

00:30:35.905 --> 00:30:37.385
- You got the address?
- Yes.

00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:38.985
Let's go.

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:49.407
Team 1 arrested someone for theft today.

00:30:49.407 --> 00:30:51.691
What's wrong? Is it someone you know?

00:30:51.691 --> 00:30:54.554
He was a suspect for my father's murder.

00:30:54.578 --> 00:30:56.311
Do you remember him?

00:30:56.953 --> 00:30:59.486
Do you remember the killer's face now?

00:30:59.486 --> 00:31:01.123
No.

00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:04.171
I still don't remember him.

00:31:04.171 --> 00:31:07.413
All I have is a feeling that he must be the killer.

00:31:07.413 --> 00:31:10.437
The statute of limitations has expired.

00:31:10.437 --> 00:31:14.481
You won't be able to send him to prison for it now.

00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:16.338
Just let it go.

00:31:16.338 --> 00:31:19.622
I've already given up on it in my head.

00:31:19.622 --> 00:31:21.777
But in my heart...

00:31:23.234 --> 00:31:25.884
I can't let it go.

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:28.213
What else can you do?

00:31:28.952 --> 00:31:34.205
Ah, you make sure you hold on to that police badge.

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:35.926
If you lose your job,

00:31:35.926 --> 00:31:42.390
either you will die or you will end up killing someone.

00:32:02.194 --> 00:32:03.556
What are you guys doing here?

00:32:03.556 --> 00:32:04.984
Did you come here for me?

00:32:04.984 --> 00:32:06.548
Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:32:06.548 --> 00:32:11.817
You're under arrest for fabricating and destroying evidence.

00:32:11.817 --> 00:32:13.844
- Do as you please.
- Cuff him.

00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:16.687
Don't you think the cuffs are a bit much?

00:32:16.687 --> 00:32:18.387
We used to be family.

00:32:18.387 --> 00:32:20.087
Give me your hands.

00:32:29.484 --> 00:32:31.684
- Hey!
- Nam Gook Hyeon!

00:32:31.684 --> 00:32:33.728
Follow them.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.550
- He's over there.
- This way.

00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:46.724
He's running over there.

00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:49.007
- Go catch him!
- You jerk!

00:32:57.672 --> 00:32:59.672
- He's going up!
- Stop, you bastard!

00:33:09.703 --> 00:33:11.403
You bastard.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.100
Asshole.

00:33:24.101 --> 00:33:25.501
You bastard!

00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:27.139
Hey, jerk!

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:30.588
Don't come near me! Stay back.

00:33:30.588 --> 00:33:31.955
Don't move!

00:33:31.955 --> 00:33:33.222
Get up!

00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:35.176
Get up!

00:33:42.156 --> 00:33:45.684
Let me just leave quietly today.

00:33:45.684 --> 00:33:48.536
I don't want to hurt him either.

00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:53.962
Drop the gun.

00:33:55.008 --> 00:33:57.174
This is your second warning.

00:33:57.174 --> 00:33:59.097
Drop the gun.

00:34:03.398 --> 00:34:05.732
This is your last warning.

00:34:05.732 --> 00:34:07.397
Drop...

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.859
the gun.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.486
Okay.

00:34:20.486 --> 00:34:24.102
I was just playing around to teach him a lesson about keeping his gun close.

00:34:24.102 --> 00:34:27.007
Don't get the wrong idea. It was just a joke.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.633
Don't be so rough with me. It was just a joke.

00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:45.615
You were really going to shoot, right?

00:34:46.288 --> 00:34:48.509
You know the rules of using firearms, right?

00:34:48.509 --> 00:34:50.309
You better follow them.

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:54.531
You make me so nervous when I'm with you, you bastard.

00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:02.992
Hey.

00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:11.223
Jae Hong, don't report to the team leader until we're done interrogating him.

00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:13.390
I'll tell him myself when I'm done.

00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:14.914
Okay.

00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:20.331
Hyeongnim.

00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:21.759
What?

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.515
Please make sure you bring up the fact that he stole my gun

00:35:25.515 --> 00:35:28.257
and used me as a hostage.

00:35:28.257 --> 00:35:31.922
It doesn't matter to me, so please add that to his charges.

00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:34.789
Did he lose his gun? I didn't see it. Did you guys see it?

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:36.746
No, I didn't see it.

00:35:36.746 --> 00:35:38.038
Of course not.

00:35:38.038 --> 00:35:41.242
Sim Dong Wook would never lose his gun.

00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:43.897
You thought you saw it because you were so out of it earlier.

00:35:43.897 --> 00:35:46.041
- Don't worry about it.
- Right?

00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:48.969
Detective Oh, you're someone who goes by the book.

00:35:48.969 --> 00:35:50.266
So you'll do what I asked, right?

00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:51.713
- What are you talking about?
- What?

00:35:51.713 --> 00:35:53.315
Ji Hyeok, we need to go.

00:35:53.315 --> 00:35:55.451
Hyeong, you should─

00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:57.749
Stop talking!

00:35:57.749 --> 00:36:00.404
What are we supposed to do if you get suspended?

00:36:00.404 --> 00:36:04.079
We worked so hard to raise you!

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.874
There's no point in raising a kid, you rascal.

00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:08.751
Don't hit him!

00:36:19.523 --> 00:36:21.457
Fabricating evidence

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.306
and destroying evidence?

00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:26.720
And killing Jang Jin Soo.

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:30.101
We found files on you from Yoo Jeong Seok's computer.

00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:36.568
He was paying attention to you so he doesn't get blamed for Jang Jin Soo's murder too.

00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:40.851
Okay.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.424
I admit to fabricating and destroying evidence.

00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:49.440
You're saying you didn't kill Jang Jin Soo?

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.664
Oh Jong Tae killed Yoon Ji Seon,

00:36:52.664 --> 00:36:54.387
and I'm the one who fabricated the evidence.

00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:59.429
Yoo Jeong Seok killed Jo Seong Gi and also Jang Jin Soo, who witnessed it.

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:02.253
I have nothing to do with that case.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.031
All I did was keep my mouth shut.

00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:06.673
Because you were afraid we would find out you framed Lee Dae Cheol?

00:37:06.673 --> 00:37:10.337
I said, all I did was keep my mouth shut.

00:37:10.337 --> 00:37:12.731
That's not a crime.

00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:16.414
How did you find out that Yoo Jeong Seok killed Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo?

00:37:16.414 --> 00:37:17.936
He didn't confess to it?

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:19.736
There was no confession.

00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:22.065
He just raised a question about it.

00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:25.391
Why would he have buried the bodies in two different places if he had killed them both?

00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:27.118
That doesn't prove that he didn't kill them.

00:37:27.118 --> 00:37:29.943
So you bastard...

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.708
Tell me why you're so certain that Yoo Jeong Seok killed Jang Jin Soo, you bastard?

00:37:35.708 --> 00:37:37.532
Detective Kang.

00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:43.380
I thought what you wanted was to reveal that Lee Dae Cheol died a wrongful death.

00:37:43.883 --> 00:37:46.482
I will say it during the trial.

00:37:46.482 --> 00:37:49.343
That Lee Dae Cheol wasn't the real killer.

00:37:49.343 --> 00:37:51.750
You should stop pushing,

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.823
or I might change my mind.

00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:02.536
It's too late to find evidence now anyway.

00:38:02.536 --> 00:38:04.855
There's only one option.

00:38:06.195 --> 00:38:09.295
Appeal to Yoo Jeong Seok's conscience.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.245
What's the statute of limitations on fabricating evidence?

00:38:15.245 --> 00:38:19.305
The statute of limitations has expired for Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:38:19.305 --> 00:38:21.527
All we have left is destroying evidence for Park Geon Ho's case.

00:38:21.527 --> 00:38:24.175
That will only get him probation.

00:38:24.175 --> 00:38:26.179
He's doing this because he knows that.

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:30.479
Nam Gook Hyeon might be right.

00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:35.088
All we can depend on now is Yoo Jeong Seok's conscience.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.673
You're tougher than I thought.

00:38:52.336 --> 00:38:54.236
I get it.

00:38:54.828 --> 00:38:59.996
All humans have animal instincts inside of them.

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:02.805
There are so many hurdles in our friendship.

00:39:02.805 --> 00:39:05.361
It seems like our friendship is about to end, but it continues on.

00:39:05.361 --> 00:39:09.191
I guess it's fate that we work together.

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:15.735
To be honest, I've had the upper hand until now.

00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:17.491
Now, the tables have turned.

00:39:17.515 --> 00:39:22.329
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:26.304
I don't know what to do because you're changing your attitude so quickly.

00:39:26.304 --> 00:39:29.971
As you said before, it's fate that we work together.

00:39:29.971 --> 00:39:32.226
We won't have one die while the other survives.

00:39:32.226 --> 00:39:34.220
If one of us goes down,

00:39:34.882 --> 00:39:36.062
we will both go down.

00:39:36.062 --> 00:39:39.382
So you're saying I don't exactly have the upper hand?

00:39:43.234 --> 00:39:44.834
Give me some time.

00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:49.677
I'll be handing you a big present soon.

00:39:49.677 --> 00:39:54.260
I look forward to finding out what that present is.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.940
[Jeonghan Daily Search and Seizure Report]

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:04.345
What do you think?

00:40:04.345 --> 00:40:05.838
It's a bit tricky.

00:40:05.838 --> 00:40:06.923
What do you mean?

00:40:06.923 --> 00:40:11.490
They can push for conviction with just circumstantial evidence.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.969
They can drag it out for lacking evidence and let it blow over.

00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:18.637
Both have potential.

00:40:18.637 --> 00:40:23.601
It also means that it depends on how the police proceed.

00:40:25.171 --> 00:40:27.998
You've sued for wrongful termination, right?

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:31.635
They'll issue a ruling as quickly as possible.

00:40:31.635 --> 00:40:35.660
And the process to get you back in the office will proceed quickly too.

00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:37.329
Thanks.

00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:39.329
But the problem is...

00:40:41.398 --> 00:40:43.798
You─

00:40:43.798 --> 00:40:48.115
I've realized something after entering this world.

00:40:48.115 --> 00:40:50.665
This world might be a mess,

00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:52.676
but there is one clear rule.

00:40:52.676 --> 00:40:56.487
There's always give and take.

00:40:57.343 --> 00:41:03.274
If he's able to overcome this, Jeong Seok will do bigger things than you.

00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:07.060

Why weren't you answering my calls?

00:41:33.273 --> 00:41:36.093
I'm sorry. I had to take care of some things on my own.

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:39.851
This isn't something you can take care of all by yourself.

Have a drink.

00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:48.851
I had a lot of drinks with you here when I used to work at the police station.

00:41:48.851 --> 00:41:54.194
I would miss out on exclusive stories, and you would lose your trials.

00:41:54.194 --> 00:41:56.931
I used to wonder when we'd finally become successful.

00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.593
And I ended up as a senior manager and you as a minister.

It will all work out. Don't worry.

I'm going to have Gi Tae return to his post as Incheon's district attorney.

She said you think you're always right

[Incheon West Police Station]

00:44:24.751 --> 00:44:29.282
The prosecutor said it's too early to issue an arrest warrant for Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:44:29.282 --> 00:44:33.282
It means the circumstantial evidence we've gathered is not enough.

00:44:33.282 --> 00:44:35.120
I thought Nam Gook Hyeon said

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.120
Yoo Jeong Seok killed both Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.049
We can't believe everything he said.

00:44:42.049 --> 00:44:44.282
There's a chance that Nam Gook Hyeon killed Jang Jin Soo

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:46.579
and is trying to frame Yoo Jeong Seok for it.

00:44:46.579 --> 00:44:50.571
Either way, Yoo Jeong Seok did kill Jo Seong Gi.

00:44:50.571 --> 00:44:54.801
If we question him about it, he'll talk about Jang Jin Soo's case too.

00:44:54.801 --> 00:44:59.238
If he gets handed to the prosecutors right now, it's obvious what the result would be.

I know Yoo Jeong Ryeol said he won't get involved in the investigation,

A journalist is supposed to discover hidden truths.

00:47:32.098 --> 00:47:36.056
Please reveal the truth through the eyes of a journalist

and what happened to Detective Jang, who was murdered at the same time and place.

00:47:45.192 --> 00:47:47.935
If you hide the truth,

00:47:47.935 --> 00:47:51.446
you would also be neglecting your duties as a journalist.

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:54.820
A journalist can't reveal the whole truth.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:00.767
But I take pride in the fact that I've never lied in my articles as a journalist.

00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:06.665
I will write my story in tomorrow's news.

You're going to make a confession through your article?

I will also reveal the truth of what I know about Lee Dae Cheol's case.

The story will include Oh Jong Tae, the man you want to desperately catch.

Why do you have to do that?

00:48:24.035 --> 00:48:29.396
I believe I've done many shameful things as a human being.

00:48:29.396 --> 00:48:34.965
But I don't want to do anything that will taint my career as a journalist.

00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:27.410
During your interview,

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:31.519
you said you applied to Jeonghan Daily because you wanted to be a journalist like me.

00:53:32.926 --> 00:53:34.526
I'm sorry.

00:53:35.137 --> 00:53:39.960
I couldn't be a role model for you.

00:53:40.896 --> 00:53:43.982
What you've shown me today as a journalist

00:53:43.982 --> 00:53:47.755
I will remember until my last day as a journalist.

00:54:07.915 --> 00:54:11.307
[The police finally reveal Lee Dae Cheol's innocence]

00:54:15.287 --> 00:54:20.013
I told you we can just share one issue!

00:54:20.013 --> 00:54:21.513
Hyeongnim!

00:54:21.513 --> 00:54:25.177
Don't you think what Reporter Jin wrote at the end is really touching?

00:54:25.177 --> 00:54:29.604
"The police and the judicial system point to Detective Kang Do Chang from Violent Crimes Team 2

00:54:29.604 --> 00:54:35.038
at Incheon's West Police Department as the driving force behind revealing Lee Dae Cheol's innocence."

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:40.214
"Sergeant Kang attended Lee Dae Cheol's retrial and admitted to an improper investigation."

00:54:40.214 --> 00:54:43.383
"Even after Lee Dae Cheol's execution, he did not let go of the

00:54:43.383 --> 00:54:48.523
reinvestigation despite pressure from within the police organization."

00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:55.483
"The police are hoping that Sergeant Kang's exemplary action to chase after the truth until the end

00:54:55.483 --> 00:55:02.960
would transform the police's poor image for improper investigations."

00:55:06.785 --> 00:55:09.630
Why did Reporter Jin write only about me?

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:13.042
I didn't do it all by myself.

00:55:13.042 --> 00:55:15.411
It's okay with us.

00:55:15.411 --> 00:55:19.011
But Detective Oh might be a little sad about it.

00:55:19.011 --> 00:55:20.856
It talks about Detective Oh here.

00:55:20.856 --> 00:55:21.964
It does?

00:55:21.964 --> 00:55:25.286
"The police being criticized for improper investigation..."

00:55:25.286 --> 00:55:28.586
Isn't that what Detective Oh did?

00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:30.205
You're right.

00:55:30.205 --> 00:55:32.349
That is about me.

00:55:32.972 --> 00:55:37.751
Hey, that's talking about you, not Detective Oh.

00:55:39.122 --> 00:55:41.105
- Hello, sir.
- How is everyone doing?

00:55:41.105 --> 00:55:43.705
What is the former chief doing here?

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.271
Hey, Kang Do Chang!

00:55:46.271 --> 00:55:47.272
Yes?

00:55:47.272 --> 00:55:50.567
How... How come my name isn't on there?

00:55:50.567 --> 00:55:52.582
I'm the one who helped you guys out!

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:55.097
How come it only talks about you?

00:55:55.097 --> 00:55:57.183
Sir, you see—

00:55:57.183 --> 00:55:59.378
I'm saying that it's good!

00:56:02.802 --> 00:56:05.893
It won't do any good to have my name on there.

00:56:05.893 --> 00:56:11.572
Anyway, the idiots from Team 2 finally did it!

00:56:14.238 --> 00:56:21.210
Five years ago, I killed Jo Seong Gi, a dirty cop, and Detective Jang Jin Soo from the West Police Department.

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:24.911
This is my confession and the last article that I'm writing as a Jeonghan Daily journalist

00:56:24.911 --> 00:56:28.961
in order to tell the truth to the readers."

00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:32.144
"I contemplated turning myself in to the police,

00:56:32.144 --> 00:56:37.387
but the police had already settled on Lee Dae Cheol as the one who killed Detective Jang Jin Soo,

00:56:37.387 --> 00:56:41.892
and no one cared about Jo Seong Gi, who had been living under a fake name."

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:46.450
"It would've been a perfect crime if I had just kept my mouth shut."

00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:55.979
"Now I'm asking for forgiveness from my colleagues and from the readers."

00:57:13.242 --> 00:57:18.909
"And I did something that could never be forgiven by Lee Dae Cheol, who was executed."

00:57:20.055 --> 00:57:25.259
"I'm the one who killed Lee Dae Cheol."

00:57:33.485 --> 00:57:37.109
[Deceased: Lee Dae Cheol]

00:57:52.205 --> 00:57:54.005
Yes, Senior Manager Yoo.

00:57:54.875 --> 00:57:57.142
How am I supposed to take this?

00:57:57.142 --> 00:58:00.492
Do you remember the present I have for you?

00:58:00.492 --> 00:58:04.286
Oh, that present was my ticket to hell?

00:58:04.286 --> 00:58:08.079
No, I haven't given you the present yet.

00:58:08.079 --> 00:58:11.894
Let's meet. I'll give it to you in person.

00:58:11.894 --> 00:58:14.406
What more could possibly be left?

00:58:14.406 --> 00:58:18.192
Do you know that Jo Seong Dae, the man you ordered to commit murder,

00:58:18.192 --> 00:58:22.102
was the brother of Jo Seong Gi, the man I killed?

00:58:22.102 --> 00:58:26.836
Jo Seong Dae blackmailed me after finding out that I had killed his brother.

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:29.370
And I have that audio recording.

00:58:30.032 --> 00:58:31.698
How will that help me?

00:58:31.703 --> 00:58:35.668
It can suggest that I'm the one who had ordered Jo Seong Dae

00:58:35.668 --> 00:58:40.307
to kill Park Geon Ho in order to bury Lee Dae Cheol's case, not you.

00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:45.508
Why... would you give that recording to me?

00:58:45.508 --> 00:58:49.433
Please don't reveal the video that you have.

00:58:49.433 --> 00:58:52.438
I don't want my family to see that.

00:58:52.438 --> 00:58:58.141
My sentence won't change much by adding conspiracy to murder.

00:58:58.141 --> 00:58:59.741
Okay.

00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:02.093
I'll take a listen before I make my decision.

00:59:02.117 --> 00:59:05.700
Where can I find that present?

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:10.188
It's just as the article says.

00:59:10.188 --> 00:59:12.812
There's nothing more I can tell you.

00:59:12.836 --> 00:59:16.330
Ask the police. Why are you asking us?

00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:19.200
Yes.

00:59:19.203 --> 00:59:20.903
Hello?

00:59:20.903 --> 00:59:23.958
I've confirmed the facts for my article.

00:59:23.958 --> 00:59:25.324
Yes.

00:59:25.324 --> 00:59:27.711
I'll take responsibility for my article.

00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:29.311
Yes.

00:59:35.938 --> 00:59:36.953
Hey, Senior Manager.

00:59:36.953 --> 00:59:39.765
Jin Seo Kyeong, can you call the police for me?

00:59:39.765 --> 00:59:41.028
What's this about?

00:59:41.028 --> 00:59:43.462
I'm going to meet Oh Jong Tae, but something doesn't feel right.

00:59:43.462 --> 00:59:45.626
Ask the police to protect me.

00:59:45.626 --> 00:59:47.429
Why? What is Oh Jong Tae going to do?

00:59:47.429 --> 00:59:51.289
I've sent you the address of where we'll be meeting. Send the detectives there.

00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:54.414
Why would you meet him if it doesn't feel right?

00:59:54.414 --> 00:59:57.465
I have to take care of Oh Jong Tae.

00:59:57.465 --> 00:59:59.852
Why do you have to take care of him?

00:59:59.852 --> 01:00:03.188
Oh Jong Tae and I both pushed Lee Dae Cheol to the execution noose.

01:00:03.188 --> 01:00:06.123
I need to make Oh Jong Tae admit it.

01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:07.932
That's the last thing I have left to do.

01:00:07.932 --> 01:00:10.125
That's something the police should do.

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:11.891
Don't put yourself in danger.

01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:14.343
My phone is running out of battery.

01:00:14.343 --> 01:00:16.634
- I'll talk to you later.
- Senior Manager!

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:37.406
Detective Oh, you got the address I sent you, right?

01:00:37.406 --> 01:00:39.239
Please go there right now.

01:00:39.239 --> 01:00:42.242
My boss is meeting Oh Jong Tae. He's in danger.

01:00:42.242 --> 01:00:44.142
Hurry!

01:01:05.717 --> 01:01:08.905
One of my senior colleagues asked me

01:01:08.905 --> 01:01:13.848
to investigate his death if he's found dead because it has to be murder.

01:01:13.848 --> 01:01:17.721
I'm going to ask you to do the same.

01:02:23.967 --> 01:02:29.073
So, let's take a listen to that audio file first.

01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:33.290
There is no audio file.

01:02:36.814 --> 01:02:39.537
I'm the present I was going to give you.

01:02:39.537 --> 01:02:42.492
I am your present.

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:17.297
Was it you?

01:04:17.297 --> 01:04:18.662
What do you mean?

01:04:18.662 --> 01:04:21.086
Are you saying I pushed him over?

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.191
He...

01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:25.639
Never mind.

01:04:25.639 --> 01:04:29.339
You won't believe me, no matter what I say.

01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:30.695
What are you waiting for?

01:04:30.695 --> 01:04:32.163
Get down there and check on him.

01:04:32.163 --> 01:04:34.179
Jae Hong, call an ambulance

01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:35.796
- and the crime scene investigators.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:35.796 --> 01:04:38.057
Take him to the station.

How did you guys end up appearing at such a critical time?

01:05:25.256 --> 01:05:28.862
Is this how you framed Lee Dae Cheol for murder too?

01:05:28.862 --> 01:05:31.474
How dare you say his name.

01:05:31.474 --> 01:05:33.528
Is this the defendant?

01:05:33.528 --> 01:05:36.999
The fact you're returning to work will be good for me, right?

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.060
It won't be bad.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.842
A journalist should write about the truth.

01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:45.592
I just realized that the truth could destroy my life.

01:05:45.592 --> 01:05:47.203
I have a question.

01:05:47.203 --> 01:05:49.076
So he did all of it.

01:05:49.076 --> 01:05:50.258
Let's catch him.

01:05:50.258 --> 01:05:52.093
We can't close this case.

01:05:52.093 --> 01:05:56.760
