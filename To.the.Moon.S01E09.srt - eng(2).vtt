(2,299.80 dollars)

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.290
Ji Song,
did you finish last month's reports?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
(Expense Report Summary)

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.500
Here you are.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.600
- And the approval forms?
- They're right here.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.500
I also verified the tax invoices.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.240
And the monthly closing reports...

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.210
have been updated on the server.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.050
Also, I've compiled a breakdown
of each team's expenses right here.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.920
Gosh. Ji Song, you're on fire today.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.890
I'm taking the afternoon off
to go pick up my boyfriend.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.590
What? Assistant Manager Oh
is off this afternoon too.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.960
On a busy day, of all times.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.170
Right.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810
I can't just give up that easily.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.950
Here we go.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670
Hi, there.
Are you here for new glasses?

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.770
- No, contacts.
- Contacts?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.070
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.140
Thank you.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.740
Taxi...

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.410
What?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.550
Did he already land?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.190
Hey!

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.130
Wait, what?
Why are you in your pajamas?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.630
Sorry, Ji Song.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.330
My mom is sick.
I had to cancel the trip.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
So I can't go.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
What? But I bought this scarf
for your mom.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.710
But even if she couldn't come,
you should have come by yourself.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.780
I don't have money.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.540
I have no money.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.180
Is it a fortune to fly here
from China?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.280
You can't even afford
a plane ticket?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.390
Actually, I bought new shoes.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.420
What?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.760
They're beautiful,
so they were a bit expensive.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.190
- But...
- Sorry, Ji Song.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.730
Let's just see each other
next time, okay?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.340
Seriously? Am I in this relationship
by myself or something?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.770
Why am I always the only one
putting in all the effort?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.810
I know this is petty,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.380
but how often have you visited Korea
while dating me?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.610
To be blunt,
I love nice things more than you do.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.950
But I have never once...

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.880
prioritized a stupid pair of shoes
over you.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.550
Why am I always second to shoes?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.320
Why am I always "next time?"

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.000
Tell me.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.530
Do you even love me?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.800
Sorry, Ji Song.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.300
But I don't understand.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.510
How can you not understand this?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.280
Why can you never understand
what I'm saying?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.490
Let's just end this.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.800
I'm exhausted too.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.670
Are you okay?

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.570
- Oh, my.
- Excuse me?

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.910
My gosh!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.080
Wait. Ji Song!

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.550
Gosh.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.830
(Episode 9: The Turning Point)

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.330
What do you think? It's nice, right?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.030
It's a singing style called scat.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.710
It's a form of jazz singing that
started in the early 20th century.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.050
I'm just making conversation.
I'm not trying to show off.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.650
Louis Armstrong was the most famous
for that, wasn't he?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.450
What's this?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.320
I did
a little research online yesterday.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.090
I am dating a musician, after all.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.760
Gosh, what?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.370
Hello, Mr. Ko.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.400
- Da Hae?
- Just go.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.240
Why are you acting like this?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.110
- I'm a bit late.
- It's okay.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.250
And here I was worried.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.580
Are you okay?

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.020
- Back when Eun Sang was ready to...
- Da Hee!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.960
Where have you two been?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.660
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.900
Gosh, that scared me.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.040
We should've come here sooner.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.880
This place is great, isn't it?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.950
What's so amazing about a place
where you can't see a thing?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.390
- I like it because we can't see.
- You mean you like not being seen.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.690
What is this? It's a door!

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.730
Da Hae, I found the door!

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.960
Da Hae,
why aren't you saying anything?

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.130
Da Hae?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.900
Da Hae? Why aren't you answering?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240
Oh, my!

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.410
Oh, no.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.480
Are you okay? Wait. I'm sorry.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.910
You really scared me.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.210
Let me see.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.020
That was terrifying.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.720
Thank you.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.870
Come on, don't worry.
We're safe here.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.440
- No one can see us.
- I know, but still.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.410
What are you, a spy?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.510
- What?
- It'd be easier to meet a real spy.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.120
Why does our relationship have to be
such a huge secret?

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.450
Come on. Don't say that.
You know exactly why.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.320
So, you don't like it?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.760
Of course I...

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.500
It's my phone.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.670
It's Ju Man.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.370
(Byeon Ju Man)

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.540
I really hope you actually like me.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.810
What?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.680
- I'm always exhausted on Mondays.
- I know.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.490
I just wish we could...

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.150
- Hey, look. Over there.
- What? What is it?

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.150
What...

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.240
When did we have
a wholesome, handsome guy...

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.570
working at our company?

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.410
Isn't that Mr. Oh from Accounting?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.440
- What?
- What?

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.020
- Let's start the meeting.
- Okay.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280
Okay.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.890
Ji Song,
could you get two coffees, please?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.190
Coffee?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.230
Yes. Our team's meeting is starting,
but the break room is out of coffee.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.500
It should've been restocked,
but it's completely empty.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.960
Just as I thought.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400
What?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.270
Be it love or coffee beans.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.640
I suppose
they all run out eventually.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.540
Until there's nothing left.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.480
Okay. Sure.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.450
You don't have to go far.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.080
Please get
two black coffees from the machine.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.750
- Mr. Song doesn't take sugar.
- That's going to be very bitter.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.990
What?

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.920
But you get used to it, I suppose.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.830
It's tough at first, but over time,

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.530
the bitterness of coffee
and the bitterness of a breakup,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.330
you get used to it all.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.200
You just do.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.470
Sure. I sure hope so.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.440
Mr. Oh, would you like some coffee?

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.280
- I'll...
- I'll be right back!

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.220
A snack subscription service?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.960
Yes. A curated box,
personalized to taste.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.790
We're offering
more than just snacks.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.300
We give them a tailored experience.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.000
But isn't it a stretch to position
our snacks as high-end?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.600
Not necessarily.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.410
People don't buy expensive things
just for the product itself.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.240
I recently had dinner at a place
in Gangnam called Eclat...

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.480
Eclat?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.150
Isn't that a really famous place?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.750
That place must be pretty expensive.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.920
It was a little hard
to get a reservation.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.450
Once I was there, it all made sense.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.950
Everything from
how the table was set...

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.560
to the chef coming out
to explain the dishes.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.090
It made me feel like
I wasn't just there to eat.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.500
How should I put it? It made me feel
like I was someone special.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.230
So you're saying the snack box...

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.300
can give consumers that same kind
of special feeling.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.170
Exactly. The personalized snack box
isn't just about sending snacks.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.710
It's about sending the customer
a message that they're special.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.810
That's why the packaging
should also be special.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.380
I was thinking,
what if we incorporated works of art?

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.020
I recently went to an exhibition
for an artist named Taylor Han.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.090
Taylor Han?

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.590
I like that artist too.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.690
No way!

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.430
You go to art exhibitions, Da Hae?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.430
Why are you only asking me that
and not Da Hee?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.940
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.
I was just surprised, that's all.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.210
Go ahead.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.440
Nice work.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.810
Good work, everyone.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.280
Good work.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.050
Hey, Da Hae.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.620
You're on a roll lately.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.290
- Thanks.
- Yes, for real.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.960
That was a great idea today.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.620
Good work!

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.460
Mr. Ko was totally blown away.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.710
What's that?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.050
It's nothing.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.780
Da Hee, could I get
the Cocomishu proposal?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.420
Sure.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.590
(Jung Da Hae)

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.670
Hey, Eun Sang. What brings you here?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.110
- The copier on our floor is broken.
- I see.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.440
What? Is she broken too?

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.440
Gosh, she scared me!

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.710
What's she doing?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.920
What are you doing?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.390
Getting some coffee.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.690
Two cups.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.360
Two cups?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.100
Looks more like 20 cups to me.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.630
What?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.140
What? When did all this...

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.440
What's with you guys?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.780
Did you multiply or something?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.580
For crying out loud.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.510
Nurse Jung, handle this.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.280
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.550
Ma'am?
I need you to look right here.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.320
Look at these crypto gains, okay?

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.290
Our day has finally come.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.930
- You can't lose it now.
- What?

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.530
It's going up!

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.930
I have to call Wei Lin...

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.040
No, wait.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.000
I shouldn't do that, right?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.940
I can't.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.470
I can't.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.810
I shouldn't do it.
Why would I make that call?

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.350
No, I can't. I shouldn't do it.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.380
I shouldn't do it.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.890
Hey!

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.590
You're going to fall!

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.890
She's completely lost it.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.630
How long do you think
she'll be like this?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.130
That relationship she made
such a huge deal about just ended.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.070
So, for a while, I'd guess?

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.010
Anyway, where are you off to?
And what's that you've got?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.010
Actually, I'm about to make
a big deal out of something myself.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.410
Get out of here.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.700
What?

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.630
He's not here.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.170
There.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.850
A surprise like this is
what makes dating fun, right?

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.790
We need to nail down the ad concept
for this season.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.990
Yes, go ahead.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.230
We need to check
consumer feedback beforehand...

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.730
so our marketing team...

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.770
can accurately define
our target audience.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.940
So you're saying you need the data.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.240
So we can align our strategy.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.110
Right, of course.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.210
So, what's the deadline
for the consumer review data?

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.110
To make the fall season deadline,
we need it by October at the latest.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.380
Really? October...

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.620
October?

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.990
- Gosh! October!
- What? Why?

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.620
- October.
- What is it?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.360
What's wrong?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.800
Are you all right?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.000
No! It's just that...

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.500
I just mean that October
might be a little tight.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.070
I see.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.470
Our rivals...

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.470
- are releasing products too,
- Get him to leave.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.280
so delays put us in a tough spot.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.740
Okay, let's take
all the time we can...

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.310
to prepare and get things in order.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.180
- Thanks for coming.
- Okay. Are you sure you're okay?

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.580
Yes, I'm fine.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.420
Wait a minute.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.590
Goodness.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.790
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.360
- One worry leads...
- What are you doing?

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.570
- to another.
- Get him to leave.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.930
- And then another, and another.
- Make him leave.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
How should I put this?

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.840
Look, whatever it is,
just go with your gut.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.940
It's like taking a test.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.840
Your first guess is
usually the right answer.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.350
Dr. Ham, you're absolutely right.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.380
Just like my gut instinct,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.880
I'll grind my team...

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.690
- into the ground.
- What?

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.390
No, I didn't mean grind...
What am I talking about?

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.620
I need to change the system.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.060
I'll have them write
20 reports a day,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.060
and make them...

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.160
- brainstorm ideas nonstop.
- Tell him no.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.230
Making them work overtime
like crazy.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.300
That was my gut instinct.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.300
Just like making soup stock,
I'll keep simmering them down...

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.640
- for those rich, savory ideas...
- Maybe you should...

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.540
rethink that.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.880
That "first guess is right" thing...

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.610
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
What's the matter?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.510
Where does it hurt? Let me help you.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.850
Mr. Ko, just a second.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.660
Wait, hold on.
Mr. Ko, just give me a second.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.890
- I hit my knee.
- Let me just...

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.190
- It's Jung Da Hee.
- I think...

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.930
No, wait. Just a second.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.200
I'm fine. It'll just take a second.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.870
Just a second. Wait.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.900
- Just a second.
- I heard you called for me, so I...

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.970
Oh, my, what in the world...

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.980
Dr. Ham, what are you doing?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.910
You're confusing me.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.320
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.890
I got dizzy all of a sudden.
Maybe it's anemia?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.990
Anemia? Oh, dear.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.360
So it was your anemia all along.
Of course. The anemia.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.660
Da Hee, come over here.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.840
She's the one in charge
of our new Cocomishu project.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.480
I thought it'd be better
to discuss this in person.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.350
You really didn't have to come
all this way.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.750
This is the new Cocomishu proposal.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.220
Please take a look.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320
Oh, no.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.430
Da Hee.
You overworked and skipped meals.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.630
Goodness, you must be starving...

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.070
What?

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.840
What's this?

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.040
- That's...
- You prepared snacks for us.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.250
Thank you so much.
That's so thoughtful of you.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.780
- Oh, gosh.
- Da Hee, here, eat this for now.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.220
Thank you.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.050
Da Hee!

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.690
Eat it right there.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.560
You need to eat quickly
so you can get back to work.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.090
Okay. Thank you.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.130
Take your time. Eat slowly.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.530
- Sure.
- Now,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.460
about our new product proposal...

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.730
I'll explain it in detail.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.170
Da Hee?

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.610
Da Hee!

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.280
Yes.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.210
Yes. Understood.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.850
What did they say? What happened?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.220
Well, for now,
someone from the distributor...

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.550
has agreed to visit tomorrow.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.690
Darn it.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.760
I heard their MD was replaced,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.330
but I never imagined they'd refuse
to carry our new product.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.530
We must get it on their shelves.
Our bonuses are on the line.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.330
Let's propose a joint NPB deal
so they have to carry our product.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.040
I have to make this a success
so I can buy more crypto...

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.110
- What did you just say?
- What?

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.870
Nothing.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.010
So, how's that NPB product strategy
report coming along?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.980
Gosh! Eun Sang!

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.480
Do you have any idea how long
we've been in this business?

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.350
Eun Sang, we're experts at this.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.990
- Just trust us on this.
- Sure.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.790
Well done.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.730
You got the product identity...

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.900
- and production schedule right,
- Yes.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.600
but you put down the wrong product
for the presentation.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.510
We talked about Butter Cracker,
not granola bars.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.610
Right. It was crackers.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.250
I guess I have to do everything
around here.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.990
- What on earth did you do?
- Sorry?

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.660
What did you do to the cookies?

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.230
What did you put in them?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.660
What do you mean?
I didn't put anything in them.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.200
It was just cake flour
and peanut butter.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.270
I followed a YouTube video exactly.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.400
And you didn't add a little love?

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.610
- I'm so disappointed.
- Are you kidding me right now?

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.710
How's Da Hee doing?

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.910
She seems to be okay
after the IV drip.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.080
The real problem is Mr. Ko.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.420
Mr. Ko? Why?

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.120
This is a crime!

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.890
No matter how I look at it,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.230
Da Hee just got caught
in the middle.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.400
It's a premeditated crime
against Dr. Ham.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.930
It's hardly a crime.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.300
- That's right.
- It's a crime.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.670
A perfect, premeditated crime.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.870
We can't let them get away with it.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.340
What's with this sudden teamwork?

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.840
Let's go to the security office.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.610
Pull up all the CCTV footage,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.750
and plaster
that criminal's face everywhere.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.580
They need to be thrown in jail.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.220
- Mr. Ko!
- Gosh, you scared me. What?

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.320
- What is it?
- Well...

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.490
How about we all get a snack?

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.060
- Out of the blue?
- I've been meaning...

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.730
to treat everyone to something,

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.930
but I haven't had the chance.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.130
And as it happens,
a new cafe just opened up nearby.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.700
You know the one, right?
Bread High, that new hot spot.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.340
You mean that Bread High?

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.810
How about some iced Americanos
and macadamia cookies for everyone?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.010
I'm in.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.980
- Me too.
- Sounds delicious.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.550
And for you, Mr. Ko,
I'll get you a special custom order.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.990
An espresso shot
with a splash of low-fat milk...

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.090
and a single drop of vanilla syrup.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.990
The Ko Dae Young Special.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.100
- A special?
- Yes.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.630
All right then,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.700
let's grab some coffee first.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.900
Let's go.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.940
- Come on, grab your stuff.
- Alright.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.010
But Da Hee, I don't think
they deliver. Is that okay?

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.250
- And it looks like it might rain.
- What?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.250
They don't deliver?

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.990
Darn it!

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.290
I can't believe one relationship
is causing all this trouble.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.820
Gosh!

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.920
Are you awake?

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.250
Dr. Ham.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.590
They said they needed to run
a few more tests.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.760
I feel fine.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.730
Have you been here this whole time?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.960
It happened in my office,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.400
so I should take
some responsibility.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.070
No. Whoever left the cookies
is to blame.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.070
What?

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.640
(Byeon Ju Man)

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.910
You should get that. I'll be quiet.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.310
No, it's fine.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.920
Is that your girlfriend?

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.550
I'd hate for her to hear my voice
and get the wrong idea.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.360
I do have a girlfriend,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.590
but this is just
one of my guy friends.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.970
I knew it.
You give off the vibe you're taken.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.940
What? What are you smiling about?

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.910
To be honest,

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.880
I secretly thought you and Da Hae
would make a great couple.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.520
But now that you've told me
you have a girlfriend,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.290
I feel a little silly
for thinking that.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.260
Why? Do we
really look good together?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:31.430
You do to me.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.500
I'll just have to set Da Hae up
with someone even better, then.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.900
Why set her up with a guy?

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.940
Why do you worry about
every little thing like that?

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.810
Because I enjoy looking out
for people like that.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.480
That's just how I am.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.280
I figured Ms. Jung
probably has a boyfriend.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.650
No.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.980
Da Hae told me
she wasn't seeing anyone.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.350
Come on, that could just be
what she says. Just words.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.760
If she were, you'd be able to tell,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.560
but I haven't seen any signs.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.360
It's not that obvious?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
No. Don't you think?

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.410
Da Hae told me
she's not seeing anyone.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.310
If she were, you'd be able to tell,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.050
but I haven't seen any signs.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.690
Hey, it's me.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.690
Where are you?

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.190
I'm still at the office.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.500
The office?

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.870
I have a lot of work to do
covering for Da Hee.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.270
I have to rewrite the report too.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.900
Wait, why are you doing that?

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.540
She's in this mess because of me.
Should I just look the other way?

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.310
I told you not to call me at work.
What if we get caught?

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.850
Hold on.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.920
Let me just ask you one thing.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080
What is it?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.920
Now that things are like this,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.090
will you ever...

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.960
- tell people about us?
- Da Hae!

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.030
I'm hanging up.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.260
(Call ended)

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.040
Here's the data on the Cocomishu.
Could you make a PowerPoint summary?

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.010
- All of this?
- It can't be helped.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.670
I was worried with Da Hee being out,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.940
but you're a real lifesaver, Da Hae.
Thanks.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.910
Wait, this one's mine.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.680
You're welcome.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.620
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.460
All right, let's wrap this up first.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.160
Cocomishu...

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.990
Welcome. How many are in your party?

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.990
This way to table three, please.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.060
Welcome. How many are in your party?

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.190
Have a reservation? Name, please?

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.200
What are you doing?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.300
I'm about to unleash
this train wreck.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.670
What choice do I have?

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.500
I'm trying for a job
at the BBQ place.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.640
So I'm practicing just in case.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.740
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.040
Your song was way more grating.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.680
I've got a problem.
I need your advice.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.010
Call a helpline.
Try the city's complaint line.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.850
- It's about a secret relationship.
- Break up.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.250
- But they have their reasons.
- Split up.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.060
They work at the same company.
The guy's in a higher position.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.460
- She feels pressured by that.
- Just give up already!

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.560
If you can't beat it with effort,
you have to know when to give up.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.530
Do you feel better holding on,
making all these excuses?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.430
Is this about my relationship
or music?

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.870
It's all an obsession, you punk.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.640
Things that are pointless,
things that are meaningless...

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.310
You'll destroy yourself
clinging to things like that.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.610
She likes me too, you know.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.540
It's not some
pointless relationship.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.950
She even baked me cookies
and wrote me a letter.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.250
A letter?

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.690
Right. The letter.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.420
Yes, I'm at the Sano Building.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.660
I'll have
a small tuna sashimi and...

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.090
Hold on a second.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.300
You want a drink now, don't you?

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.830
Should I get a large tuna
and a bottle of kaoliang?

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.400
You jerk. You got a death wish?

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.640
Sorry, I'll order next time.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.700
- The letter. Where did I put it?
- Thank you.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.910
Oh, it's at the office.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:40.980
Where are you going?

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.510
Hey, where are you going?

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.050

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:59.060
Eun Sang,
where's the NPB planning list?

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.600
Eun Sang, do I include sales data
for existing products as well?

I can't deal with these guys.

Hey, why won't you eat anything?

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.010
Are you crying?

What's so great about love anyway?

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.160
I'm going to bed.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.360
At least turn off the TV...

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.630
You could at least turn off the TV.

We push through with guts and grit!

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.760
That will do.

What's wrong with your face?

Sir, if you'll permit me,
I have a proposal for our team.

Permission granted.

is the spirit of a soldier, sir!

- What?
- What?

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.150
To focus on our objective
and waste no time,

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.850
for maximum efficiency and teamwork,
we need the spirit of a soldier!

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.620
We all need to approach our work...

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.950
with the discipline
of soldiers, sir.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.690
On that note, I will now commence

going too far?

That's right. You were in the ROTC,
weren't you?

- Left is this way.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.530
Right. Roll to the left.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.670
Roll to the right!

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.870
Roll to the right.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.770
Darn it!

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.340
Our performance bonuses
are on the line.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.510
We'll do this with grit and guts.
Understood?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.120
- Yes, ma'am!
- I can't hear you! Understood?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.990
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.920
Are you sure you're all right?

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.190
I'm really fine, so you don't need
to worry about me.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.660
- I'm sorry for worrying you.
- Don't be.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.100
Did you finish organizing
the Cocomishu data?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.130
I'll go get it for you right now.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.670
Get some rest.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240
Da Hee?

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.140
Da Hae.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.910
Are you feeling any better?

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.080
I'm totally fine.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.620
By the way, I heard you covered
for me yesterday.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.690
I'm so sorry about that.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.220
- It's no big deal. I was fine.
- Today, I was going to...

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.960
No, never mind.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.190
Let me buy you lunch tomorrow.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.660
I have to stop
by the security office at lunch.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.460
The security office? Why?

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.270
Dr. Ham's office...

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.540
isn't a place
just anyone can get into,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.310
and we don't even know
who left those cookies.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.680
To just end up
on his desk like that...

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.750
It just seems like a security risk
for the company.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.050
I think I need to look into it.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.920
Is all that really necessary?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520
What was that?

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.820
It was nothing.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.860
Hey, should I go for you?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.430
Since you're still not feeling...

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.660
That's perfect.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.470
It'd be even better
if you came with me.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.000
I was a little scared to go alone.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.040
What?

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440
Together?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.250
Ji Song, did you send that fax?

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:13.810
Yes.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.080
You didn't send 20 pages at once
like yesterday, did you?

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.550
Of course not.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.090
I scheduled it to send
just the pages you asked for.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.630
We're all out of paper.
I need to refill the printer paper.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.000
I'll be right back.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.100
Hey... Ji Song.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.110
Hey, Ji Song!

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:41.540
Why does she keep...

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.450
You must be thrilled, Mr. Oh.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280
Sorry?

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.720
Ji Song is obviously avoiding you.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.150
Why would I be happy about that?

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.960
You really don't get women at all.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.360
Don't you see?

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.860
Now that you've gotten so handsome,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.000
Ji Song is just being shy
around you.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.430
And she has a particular weakness
for handsome men.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.570
Really?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.040
Seems like it.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.940
I guess your crush...

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.140
isn't one-sided anymore.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.410
What? No way.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.320
Gosh, it's exhausting trying
to avoid him all the time.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.190
I might as well just disappear.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.430
What? No way.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.360
She wants to watch
the security footage with you?

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.000
- What do I do?
- Gosh.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.340
How about getting your story
straight with Dr. Ham?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.140
Say he ordered cookies and forgot.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.170
Just say you ran an errand for him.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.510
- I can't.
- Why not?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.540
Because I didn't just go there
once or twice.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.850
If she goes back a few days
on the CCTV footage,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.320
she'll even see us
holding hands in the hall.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.990
- What if she sees that?
- Gosh.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.560
Just say your hand was heavy,
so Dr. Ham was helping you carry it.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.290
But I even had my arm around him.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.460
Your arms were heavy,

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.800
so you just rested them
on his shoulder.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.100
Just say you rested them there
like this.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.900
We kissed too.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.770
Because your lips were heavy...

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.170
No, wait. Never mind.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.340
Seriously? Messing around at work?

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.470
Even I don't do that anymore.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.480
What am I going to do?

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.410
Wait a second.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.310
(Marketing Team Jung Da Hee)

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.080
Oh, no. It's Da Hee calling.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.480
- Just go.
- Go on.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.780
- Da Hae.
- Go on.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.820
You're coming with me.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.860
Where?

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.220
- Failure is not an option! Yes?
- What?

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.360
- Yes?
- Come!

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.860
Where? Where are you taking me?

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800
Yes.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.100
But we can't check the CCTV footage
for every single day.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.640
We just need yesterday's footage...

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.340
from the 18th-floor hallway.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.970
But you know,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.080
we don't actually know how long
those cookies were sitting there.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.950
I don't think we can just assume
it was yesterday.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.020
- That's a good point.
- Right.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.780
In that case, what if we...

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.420
fast-forward through
last week's footage?

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.320
What? The entire week?

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.520
Yes. Let's start with Monday...

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.460
No. On Monday,
we had sushi in his office.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.100
- Should I pull up Monday's footage?
- On Monday,

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.700
didn't Dr. Ham have
an off-site meeting that day?

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.670
He even came to our team to pick up
the materials for it.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.640
I doubt we'll find anything useful
on that day.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.210
That's right.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.640
Okay, then should we start
with Tuesday?

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.980
I used a work report as an excuse
and stayed for an entire hour.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.220
Shall I pull up Tuesday's footage?

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.650
There was electrical work being done
on the 18th floor on Tuesday.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.360
So many people
were coming and going.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.260
It'd be hard to spot a stranger.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.860
And Dr. Ham's assistant also said...

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.230
they didn't see
who brought the cookies in...

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.340
- and when.
- I see.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.970
Right, so...

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.710
maybe we should just give up
on the CCTV footage.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.810
Still, I think we should at least
take a look at yesterday's footage.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.310
Could you please show us the footage
from the morning?

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380
Yes, of course.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720
Oh, no.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.230
Darn it.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.300
When those elevator doors open,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.560
I'll walk out
holding that cookie box.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.600
Darn. What do I do?

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.410
Hey, what are those people doing?

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.180
Are they dancing?

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.920
- What?
- What is wrong with them?

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.820
What's this?

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.090
Hey, number one.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.420
Number five.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.620
- Over there.
- There.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.260
- Hey, over there.
- There!

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.870
- Eun Sang.
- What?

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.910
It's so embarrassing!

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.420
Da Hae better treat us
to something amazing for this.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.620
Are they doing a magic trick?

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.430
- Over there.
- There.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.060
(Playback speed settings)

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:28.300
I'm getting dizzy.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500
Let's just watch it quickly, okay?

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.070
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.980
See? It doesn't look like
anyone was there.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.610
You're right.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.720
That's too bad.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.050
Since it's come to this,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.990
- just chalk it up to bad luck...
- I knew it.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.490
I guess I have no choice
but to read the letter.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.760
Excuse me?

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.530
Wait, what did you mean by a letter?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.430
It must have been
next to the cookie box.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.870
I didn't notice it then.
It got swept up with my documents.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.670
I only found out this morning
when Mr. Ko sorted my papers.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.510
I see.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.280
So, have you read it?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.910
Not yet.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.850
There's the privacy issue,
for one thing.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.490
But if someone went to the trouble
of avoiding the CCTV...

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.490
for them to be that meticulous,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:30.160
this person might be dangerous.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.230
I think I should take this letter
to the police.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.930
The police?

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.800
Good thing it was just me yesterday,

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.100
but someone
could've been badly hurt.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.800
I don't even want to think about it.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440
I don't know about that.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.810
I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.080
So, where's the letter now?

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.520
It's in my break room locker.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.690
I'll take it to them
after the meeting.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.190
I see.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.620
The break room?

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660
Aren't you going up?

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.500
I'm just going to stop
by the restroom.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.100
- You go on ahead.
- Okay.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.670
This is driving me crazy.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.810
The break room.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.050
Where is it?

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.350
(Jung Da Hee)

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.990
Darn it.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.870
Okay. Hair dryer.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.770
(Employee Kang Eun Sang)

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.420
Is the sales analysis report ready?

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.250
- Ready, ma'am!
- Ready, ma'am!

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.820
Did you add the supplementary data?

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.990
Yes, ma'am!

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.000
This instructor is deeply moved.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.330
See? We can do this!

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.540
We can get those bonuses!

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.610
- Right this way, please.
- The clients are here.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.680
Hello.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.620
- I'm sorry.
- Ji Song.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.750
Yes?

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:40.790
Are you crazy?

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.960
Since when is a work document
your personal diary?

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.490
What? What's wrong?

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.490
Every department is freaking out
because they all got the wrong fax.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.430
Mr. Song just took that
into the meeting.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.530
With this?

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.040
I will now present the proposal
on revising our expense management.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.310
To achieve
more efficient expense management,

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.640
we will regularly review and improve
our expenditure process.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.550
First, prevent waste
on non-essential trips.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.780
- Okay.
- "Prevent unnecessary tears."

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.220
"A new, exciting feeling
has found me."

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.050
"My heart is bouncing.
I'm just going with this feeling."

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.120
"Hmph, hmph."

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.990
(I'm just going with this feeling.
Hmph, hmph.)

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.000
No, this is...

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.630
What is it?

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.300
- What is this?
- Ji Song, are you insane?

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.770
Why are you eating that?

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:35.180
I'm sorry!

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.610
- What's going on?
- I...

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.680
Assistant Manager Oh,
I believe you're up next.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.150
Yes. Regarding
each department's budget...

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.220
Gosh, that startled me.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.020
- I'm sorry. Just a moment.
- Where are you going?

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.020
- Can you take over for me?
- Where are you going?

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.520
- Sorry, excuse me!
- Hey!

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.030
Ji Song.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.570
Hey, are you okay?

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:02.570
Gosh.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.440
Oh, gosh.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.010
We've looked into this
from a few angles,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.650
and I'm afraid it will be difficult
for us to carry this new product.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.250
We know!

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.750
Okay, there's no need to shout.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.020
That's why we...

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.460
"are using the Marron Confectionery
brand image..."

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.560
"to propose the creation
of an NPB product!"

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.830
The thing is,
that's not what we need right now.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.000
Fine, go on. Let's hear it.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.470
"So, along with a reliable
Marron Confectionery NPB product,"

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.440
"we prepared a sales strategy
for the new product launch..."

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:42.940
"for you!"

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.680
If you want it in stores so badly,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.280
why not work
with another distributor...

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.520
and offer them
a different kind of promotion?

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.650
That would create a fairness issue.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:53.550
We...

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.920
"Instead, by producing our
Butter Cracker as an NPB product,"

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.960
- "we can drive up sales!"
- Excuse me.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.030
Yes?

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.800
- Can't you answer without reading?
- Excuse me?

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.340
I mean, you've just been reading
from that paper this whole time.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.540
- Can't you answer me without that?
- No, it's just...

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.570
It's not that, it's just...

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:15.740
Oh, that was a close call. Darn.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.840
Why did she take this?

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.620
Hey.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.030
- Oh, my!
- What's that?

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.090
What's happening?

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.660
What's going on?

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:37.860
No!

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.500
- Oh, my gosh, what do we do?
- What's going on?

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.570
Hey!

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.140
Regarding the issue you raised,
first...

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.970
- What?
- What's going on?

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.180
Hey, this thing...

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.610
A blackout.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.510
I think we have a blackout!

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.150
You've got to be kidding me.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.080
What do we do?

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.350
What do we do?

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.220
Say something.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.860
Could you...

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.790
please give us a moment?

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.100
Why isn't this working?

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.460
I think we're trapped.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.000
What do we do?

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.430
What?

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.300
- It's really not opening?
- No.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.180
The letter.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.680
- I found it.
- You what? Found what?

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.760
Yes, hello?
Sir, this is Jung Da Hae.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.830
Yes?

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.160
It's about our cookie project.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.230
There was something
I forgot to report.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.600
The letter...

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.470
I mean, there was a document,
and I completely forgot about it.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.740
What document?

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.850
- A confidential one.
- Confidential?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.410
Yes. It's sort of...

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.720
a log of internal communications...

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.790
This one.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:15.760
I left this there with the cookies,

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.360
but I totally forgot about it.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.070
Thank goodness I found it.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:21.030
Oh, no.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:22.340
What?

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:23.970
Where did it go?

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.870
If this is what you're looking for,

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.780
I have it.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.250
(Oh Dong Gyu)

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.390
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
I just twisted my ankle a little.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.690
I know, but still.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.960
I enjoyed your diary, Ji Song.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.330
I wonder who makes
your heart bounce.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.000
Assistant Manager Oh?

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.270
Of course not!

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.040
Please just put me down.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.470
Come on, you could barely walk.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.980
The elevator's out
due to the blackout,

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.740
so let me at least get you to
the nurse's office.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.680
No, I'm fine.
Just put me down, please.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.320
- Put me down.
- Wait...

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.090
- Wait, Ji Song.
- Please.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:15.460
- Hey, Ji Song.
- Gosh.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.730
Ji Song, what's wrong?
Why are you crying?

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.800
Is it your ankle?
Does it hurt that much?

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.170
It's not that.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.000
It's because of you,
Assistant Manager Oh.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.310
I just feel so bad.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.740
What? What for? Why?

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.120
I don't feel any butterflies.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.790
How did you...

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.420
Your hand. It's bleeding.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.830
I found it in the trash can
at the convenience store.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.200
(Flammable waste)

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.240
Oh, gosh.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:13.650
What?

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.490
(To Dr. Ham)

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.700
I think this smell has seeped
into my very bones.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.130
Still,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.500
you didn't have to go
digging through the trash.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:38.040
You usually pretend not to know me
when other people are around.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.010
A letter from someone like that...

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.440
How could I throw away
a top-secret document like this?

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.650
- But still...
- It's okay.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.180
It's a sickness of mine.
I'm drawn to things that are futile.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.690
I never meant to fall this hard.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:55.690
But what can you do?

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.160
If this is really my sickness,

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.290
I'll just suffer through it,

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.030
and I don't care if it kills me.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.130
I...

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:08.570
I...

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.540
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.740
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.180
It's not pointless.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.880
It means something. Darn it.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.150
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- What's she doing?

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.560
What are you doing?

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.190
We can't just stay trapped in here.
Dr. Ham is hurt.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.830
Gosh. You're hurt?

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.260
Then let us help you push.

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.330
No.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:14.470
You make it sound like an emergency.
Just stay put.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.700
No! I'm taking you to the hospital.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.110
It's not designed to move like that.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.540
Da Hae, you'll get hurt. Stay put.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.380
I don't care if I get hurt!
I'm telling you, we have to get out.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.080
I'm telling you, it won't open.
Da Hae, you'll get seriously hurt.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.980
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't solve this with force.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.550
For crying out loud.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.490
It just opened.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.700
Are you all right?

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.400
Da Hae, are you okay?

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.530
I'll take her to the hospital.
You guys go on ahead.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.600
Okay.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.270
My gosh.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.980
Just so you know,
I can't help it if people see us.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.950
I can't just leave
an injured person, so...

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.010
I like you.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.020
What?

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.260
Dr. Ham, I like you.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.220
I really like you.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:16.100
From now on, I won't hide it
and say it out loud.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.400
And if words aren't enough...

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.870
If they're not enough?

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.640
If they aren't enough...

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.310
Then keep saying it until they are.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.170
What was that? You like me?

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.210
- That's what I said.
- What was that? You like me?

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.110
- I said I like you.
- What was that? You like me?

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.080
- What's wrong with you?
- Say it again.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.420
I think...

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.320
I don't...

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.890
get butterflies over
handsome guys anymore.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.230
Even after breaking up with someone
as handsome as Wei Lin,

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.600
I'm still eating just fine.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.070
What are you doing?

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.280
And even when I start to cry,
it doesn't last very long.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.420
Are you crying?

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.890
What's so great about love anyway?

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:18.420
I'm going to bed.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.690
And, more than anything,

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.500
even when I see the prettiest ring
in the world,

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.730
something else catches my eye first.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:29.070
Hey, you got a field jacket?
Something like a military uniform.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.170
- What are you doing?
- Eun Sang.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.270
It says you can buy that
with an interest-free plan.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:37.080
There you go.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.410
That's more like it.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.980
You really never change, do you?

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.150
Do all your relationships
end by splurging?

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.390
No, that's not it.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.020
"Interest-free" is
just a sales tactic.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.820
The retailer pays the commission,

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.990
and that cost is included
in the price.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.230
So it's nothing
to get excited about.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.460
What's with you?

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.960
I've been taking
an economics course online.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.300
What?

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.900
Eun Sang.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.640
I'm honestly really sad.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.100
Breaking up with him hurts so much.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.870
But it's weird.

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:09.510
It doesn't feel like
my world's ended.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.380
And that's kind of bittersweet,
you know?

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.550
I guess I'm changing too. Right?

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.420
Assistant Manager Oh,
you've gotten so handsome.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.450
Even the back of your head...

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.290
It's like your face was re-sculpted.
You look amazing.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.160
But I'm not getting any butterflies.

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.500
I know I should feel butterflies,
if only out of common decency.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.130
I feel so bad about it.
I really should be.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:37.600
Especially after I said
handsome guys are my type.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.140
I don't even get butterflies,

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.280
and I feel so bad about that...

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.680
That's why I couldn't face you.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:52.320
Then what gives you butterflies now?

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.160
Money!

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:03.060
Watching the money pile up
in my crypto account is just...

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:05.830
so thrilling. It's a total rush.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.400
Wait, what about Gang Dong Won?

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.570
Sorry?

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.010
You wouldn't get butterflies
even for Gang Dong Won?

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.340
He's an exception, of course.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.080
Gang Dong Won is in a league
of his own.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.020
Wait, your taste didn't change.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.050
It just expanded.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.950
Gosh, and here I was...

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.090
thinking it was something serious.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.560
What?

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.960
Ji Song,
you should just follow your heart.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.830
You don't have to worry about me.

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.370
But still...

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.500
Come on. Let's get going.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.200
Okay.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.140
Careful.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.710
Are you okay?

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.650
Let me piggyback you
just to the nurse's office.

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:56.580
- What?
- Come on, hurry.

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.050
- But...
- Come on, quickly.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.660
I'm sorry.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.800
Just don't avoid me so much, okay?

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:18.040
Then I'll just...

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.970
be fine on my own.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.340
I won't ask for anything more.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.910
What kind of thing is that to say?

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.720
That just makes me feel worse.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.020
Stop crying, all right?

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:35.120
(Marron Confectionery)

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.370
Oh, you're still here?

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.140
How could we leave before you?

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.780
Eun Sang, I'm sorry.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.710
You worked so hard on that meeting,
and I ruined it.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.880
No, it's not your fault.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.120
Do you guys want to get a drink
with me tonight?

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.630
- With us?
- With us?

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.700
When I think about it,
this is all my fault.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.530
No!

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.340
It's my fault, okay?

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:24.870
Come on.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:27.010
What's done is done. Why rehash it?

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.480
You've been doing so well.
Why are you acting like this now?

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:32.680
Can you nail
this presentation or not?

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.650
Your discipline is completely shot!

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.020
Saet Byul, are you okay?

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.420
No, it's just the power
went out at Daddy's office,

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.590
so I got worried and wanted to check
if you lost power too.

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.860
Don't worry, Daddy's fine.
Daddy's a Superman, right?

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:48.230
Nothing in the world can scare me.

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.260
I'll call you back in a bit, okay?

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.570
Sorry about that.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:56.440
I was worried because
my daughter was home alone.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.540
Eun Sang.

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.310
I'm sorry.

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:02.610
I ruined everything.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.680
Come on.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.580
I'm a team leader now,
so why can't I pull my own weight?

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.020
Earlier, that guy...

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.890
just glared at me and scoffed,

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:17.220
so I just got intimidated.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.160
My mind went completely blank.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.230
Look.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.070
Why are you beating yourself up
so much over it?

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.220
Eun Sang, are you really upset?

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.960
Your eyes are all red.

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:56.530
No. I'm not.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.840
But Eun Sang.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.370
Earlier,

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:10.880
you were crying, weren't you?

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:12.350
Well...

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:14.810
No, it's not that.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.690
It's just that a man
who's a superhero at home...

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.760
has to constantly bow his head
to other people.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:33.100
For a man his age to be disrespected
while he's trying to work...

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.170
I just wondered
if that's how it really has to be.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.640
Hey, that's just part of the job.
It happens.

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.640
No.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.980
Work is tough enough as it is,

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:53.190
so I shouldn't have made it
even harder for you.

00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.760
I'm sorry.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.960
I neglected my actual duties,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.670
and at some point,

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.270
I started to see you both...

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.900
as just another problem
that I had to solve.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.310
Well...

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.840
We can be a bit of a handful.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.580
From now on, I'm going to do better.
I swear.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.820
You've always tried your best.

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.020
And you're doing a great job now.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.990
Eun Sang.

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.760
You've really changed.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.860
I have?

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:38.160
For guys like us, who are nothing,

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:42.170
you care so much
and even cry for us.

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.540
I told you I wasn't crying.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:47.710
I never thought you'd agree
to have a drink with us.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:51.940
- Now you're treating us to drinks.
- I never said I was paying.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.850
Do you remember how badly
we wanted to grab a drink...

01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:58.250
with her after work?

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.650
- That's right!
- Right?

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:02.520
- Hey.
- Always.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.930
Work might have been a bust,
but I'm feeling great tonight.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:11.360
So to celebrate,
drinks are on me tonight!

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.700
- I'll drink to that!
- Cheers.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.300
- Cheers.
- I can't hear you.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.010
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:20.840
- With grit!
- With guts!

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.280
Eun Sang,
were you really in the military?

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.580
You're a total natural.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.450
Row the boat!

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.550
Row the boat!

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.590
It's fine, let's go.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.360
My bad. Sorry about that.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.160
(Marron Confectionery)

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.500
Mr. Ko.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.730
- I have something to tell you.
- That marketing proposal.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.940
I submitted your proposal.
Just so you know.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.910
What? For real?

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:57.240
The personalized
snack subscription service...

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.880
that's tailored to customer tastes.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.710
It was a fantastic idea.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.650
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:06.420
it was a completely fair evaluation.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.220
I didn't give it a push...

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.760
just because you
and Dr. Ham are dating.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.930
- So don't get me wrong.
- Right.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.930
Wait, what?

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.700
What?

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.670
How did you know?

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.140
The CCTV footage.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.810
But still,

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.780
kissing in the company hallway
is a bit much, don't you think?

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.520
You saw that?

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:42.990
But then,

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:44.990
why are you covering for me?

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:46.960
You're not the only ones in love.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.530
My wife and I keep romance alive.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.600
Besides, nothing good comes
from it getting exposed at work.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.500
And you also turned a blind eye
for me once.

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:01.910
That money I took before?
I gave it all back.

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:03.540
I didn't keep a single cent.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:05.810
I see.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.580
Right.

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:09.680
Ms. Round.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.350
No, I mean, Ms. Jung Da Hae.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.720
Hold your head up high.

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.720
You were always so timid,

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.190
it made me want to push you around.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.660
But it's been great to see
the change in you lately.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.500
Your taste seems more refined,

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:29.600
and you've broadened your horizons.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.300
And best of all,

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.370
I love seeing how confident you are
at work.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.580
Right. Thank you.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.050
I'm really going to try...

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.690
to hold my head high from now on.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:51.060
Right. Hold your head high
and just focus on your work.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:55.830
Yes, sir.

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.960
All right, enough of this.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.330
Come on, let's get to work.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.800
Breaking news, everyone!
This is huge.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.770
Dr. Ham put in his resignation.

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.780
Hoppang Bite posted it
on the message board.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.810
What do you mean?

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:11.940
What did you say?

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.520
(Epilogue)

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.620
Excuse me?

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:22.760
What did you just ask?

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.190
I asked why you ate the cookie.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.930
- That's because you told me...
- Don't you have a peanut allergy?

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.600
I'm sorry?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.100
That's what they said
at the hospital.

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.600
That it was
a typical allergy symptom.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.300
You must have known
you were allergic.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.910
But anyone could see it was full
of almonds and peanuts,

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.240
so I'm wondering why you ate
something full of them.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.050
I guess I didn't look that closely.
I had no idea.

01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.120
You had no idea?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.820
Fine, let's say that's true.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.120
- What about the letter?
- The letter?

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.660
Didn't you see the letter
next to the box of cookies that day?

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.730
Yes, I saw it.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.460
Mr. Ko thought it was for me
and put it on my desk.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:05.870
So where is it now?

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:07.370
I threw it out.

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:15.740
It didn't seem important.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.010
What did you say?

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.620
Was it something really important?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.620
What should I do?
I swear I didn't mean any harm.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.690
Even if you didn't mean any harm,

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.290
I'd say there was a hidden agenda,
wouldn't you?

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.830
Looking at you now, Da Hee...

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.400
You have a peculiar personality.

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.500
What's your deal?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.370
Are you just born that way?

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.910
(To the Moon)

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.700
(Special thanks to Zhang Hao
for his cameo)

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.630
What's going on?

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:15.970
Enderion has plummeted...

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.200
- by nearly 30 percent.
- Hurry, run!

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.570
Shouldn't we pull our money out?

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.240
Are you crazy?
If we sell now, we'll be real fools.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.180
We're all going to get wiped out.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.640
We should stay out of crypto
for now.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.150
I heard someone at our company
made a million dollars.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:30.150
Weren't you investing too, Da Hae?

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:32.480
Or was it just Eun Sang
who profited?

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.850
Everyone at work is saying
Eun Sang is going to quit.

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:36.920
Then why hasn't she
told us anything?

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:41.190
