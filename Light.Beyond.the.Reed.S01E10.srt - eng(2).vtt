00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.290
I wouldn't have lost my job.

If someone really reports you,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.000
what does that have to do with me?

who insisted Sibei should come back.

My grades are way better
than my brother's.

You even paid
a placement fee for his high school.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.300
I know you didn't.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.770
I didn't.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.266
They wouldn't dare post it online.

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:31.770
If it spreads online, it's a crime...

00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:32.688
Sibei.

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:33.460
I want to go home.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.933
Sibei, where are you going? Sibei!

00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:35.820
Sibei, calm down.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.070
- Listen. Calm down.
- I want to go home.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.700
Sibei!

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.460
- Calm down!
- Don't run off!

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.610
- We're here with you!
- Running won't help!

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.890
- Calm down a bit!
- Sibei, listen to me!

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.730
You need to calm down now.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.780
Don't be afraid.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.650
Mom.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.490
Mom!

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:45.980
What are you doing?

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.533
Was it you who called the police?

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.980
Was it you who said
you could handle this?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.100
Our whole family came here with you.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.700
And now you want to go back?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.340
I'm telling you,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.420
no one's going back!

00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:13.911
Do you know
how much courage it took for us?

00:14:14.977 --> 00:14:17.066
Do you know
how much we've suffered for you?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.490
Do you know how many times

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.755
people have pointed fingers
at us because of you?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.820
You want to save face?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.180
So we don't deserve ours?

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.530
Ye Sibei, listen to me.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.250
This is the path you chose.

00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:37.955
Even if you have to crawl,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.610
you'll finish what you started.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.730
Do you understand?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.660
Sibei.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.010
The news is already out there.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.010
If we walk away now,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.060
we'll never clear our names.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.180
Sibei, look at me.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.180
Sibei.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.420
We've come this far.

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:38.100
Think about everything
you've been through.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.940
Sibei.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.420
You did nothing wrong.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.610
He's the one who's guilty.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.180
Let the guilty face punishment.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.460
Make him say he's sorry to you.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.700
Make him apologize.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.420
That's what justice should look like.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.610
No audio, video, or photo

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.530
can ever hide the truth.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.650
Sibei, you did nothing wrong.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.180
Ye Sibei.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.220
There's something we need to tell you.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.180
Please come with me.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.450
Hello.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.010
I'm her legal representative.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:56.850
I'll go with her.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.940
Alright.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.780
(People's Court)

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.650
Ms. Ye,

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.980
the prosecution has requested
to postpone the hearing.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.850
Why?

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.940
Because the defendant's lawyer

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.010
submitted new evidence

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.980
that the prosecution didn't have before,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.290
it needs to be verified.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.380
We'll inform you
of the new hearing date later.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.220
Alright, thank you.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.660
Sibei, don't worry yet.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.900
It's part of the normal process.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.100
(Convenience Waiting Area)

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.090
Postponed hearing.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.530
The defense submitted new evidence.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.380
Then let Sibei

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.220
go home and rest.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.460
Sibei.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:40.340
(May All Things Go Well)

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.570
Dad.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.850
Mom.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.900
Actually,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.330
I've handled

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.330
similar cases before.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.250
Those audio recordings

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.050
can often be edited

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.810
or technically altered.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.250
The court won't just

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.570
take their word for it.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.620
They'll conduct
forensic verification next.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.570
Even if we take a step back,

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.180
and say the recording is real,

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.380
it still proves nothing.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.660
In that situation,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.530
the victim might have complied

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.460
to protect her own life.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.250
The trial hasn't even begun yet.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.770
We can't lose our composure first.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.130
Mom.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:43.650
Dad.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.420
Our son's right.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.570
Take a shower first.

00:21:30.777 --> 00:21:31.890
I'll run the water for you.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.770
How did you feel
when you heard the recording?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.060
Disgusted?

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.860
I didn't feel much.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.660
I didn't think anything of it.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.140
Would you really believe me?

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.420
Would you truly
not mind something like that?

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.660
Would you still love me?

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.020
Sibei.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.620
Sex sometimes represents humiliation,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.460
but more often,

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.770
it represents love.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.490
Ye Sibei,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.940
I love you.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:23.250
♪Listen to that echo♪

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:31.050
♪Stripping away tears and truth♪

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.360
♪A lifetime♪

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.880
♪Still can't escape fate♪

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:48.120
♪Yet I use all my strength
to hold myself close♪

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.050
I was terrified then.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.570
I couldn't see.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.700
My mind was in chaos.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.220
I just kept thinking,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.010
I must survive.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.980
So whatever he told me to do,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.420
I had to do it.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.770
Qin Nan.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.290
If I hadn't called the police at first,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980
and just taken the money,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.620
would things be better?

00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:35.250
If you hadn't called the police,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.010
they wouldn't have talked about money.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.420
And if I hadn't?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.220
My dad used to be a very timid man.

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:53.290
One year, my parents came back

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.530
from working out of town.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.810
When they heard my brother
and me had been bullied,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.420
they went to confront that family.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.020
He.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.020
He.

00:25:04.577 --> 00:25:06.377
Come on,
hold the umbrella for your brother.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.810
Is He home?

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.810
Oh, it's you.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:10.700
Qin Fu?

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.620
What are you here for?

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.050
There's something

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.180
I need to talk to you about.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.570
Today, my boys, Qin Bei and Qin Nan,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.822
were playing under that tree.

00:25:17.888 --> 00:25:19.050
Your son, He Jie, came over,

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.700
and without a word,
started hitting them,

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.530
- claiming the tree was yours.
- Wait.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.090
You little brat!

00:25:24.888 --> 00:25:25.930
- Coming!
- Get over here!

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.890
What is it, Dad?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.250
Did you hit Qin Bei?

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.700
No, I didn't.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.420
Did you hear him?

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.090
You've been working away
all these years.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.530
Have you ever taken care of your kid?

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.730
Now he's learned to lie.
Take him home and beat him.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.460
I didn't lie. He's the one who hit me!

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.610
He,

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.940
Qin Bei isn't the kind
of child who lies.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.288
Look at the bruise on his face.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.770
He Jie isn't telling the truth.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.220
My son said he didn't hit him,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.060
so he didn't.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.900
That tree over there

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.050
is ours.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.420
From now on,

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.911
(He Family Tree. Keep Away.)
if your son plays here,

00:25:56.911 --> 00:25:57.711
I'll beat him up.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.620
You're being unreasonable.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.770
Why can your son play here,

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.140
but mine can't?

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.010
Don't push your luck.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.850
Get him!

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.900
(Dad!)

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.860
All these years,

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.050
that memory has never left my mind.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.090
Every time I close my eyes,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.460
I still feel

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.460
like that same helpless child.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.330
Powerless.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.620
Hearing my father say,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:45.940
"Son,

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.500
close your eyes.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.900
Don't look."

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.730
So, Sibei,

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.460
calling the police
cuts through the chaos.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.460
If you don't report it,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.050
you'll keep losing pieces of your life.

00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.488
You must call the police.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.660
You have to win.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.140
Otherwise, you'll end up like me.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.090
Trapped forever in that moment of shame.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.940
We'll win.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.460
We definitely will.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.530
- You're back.
- You're back.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.370
Lawyer Meng.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.330
Mr. Zhao.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.050
What are you doing?

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.140
You've been inside for days.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.420
Let's get rid of the bad luck.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.570
Alright.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.490
I was worried
this case might mess you up.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.700
Brush it off.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.010
How's Wenwen? Is she doing okay?

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.220
She's fine, at school.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.820
Good.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.820
Lawyer Meng.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.090
Thank you.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.930
No need to be polite.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.810
- Please, have a seat.
- Sit.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.140
I actually wanted

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.530
to discuss a few things with you.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.820
Go ahead.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.010
Although we've requested a postponement,

00:28:51.311 --> 00:28:52.460
and our submitted evidence

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.010
is still under forensic review,

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.810
I still believe

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.090
that, for this case,

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.810
we should perhaps consider

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.180
working on other fronts as well.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.900
What do you mean?

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.250
Although this trial won't be public,

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.860
it has already drawn major attention.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.250
I believe the media

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.810
won't let go of this story.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.700
So even if we win in court,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.010
the final outcome
might still hurt both sides.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:20.650
In any case,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.420
no matter what happens,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.420
we must minimize the damage.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.660
Actually,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.940
there's still a key witness

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.380
in this case.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.850
Chuchu.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.250
Hello, Ms. Liu.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.244
I've arrived already.

00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:49.380
What would you like to drink?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.900
- I'll order it first.
- Ms. Liu,

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.260
I really enjoyed our chat today.

00:29:52.266 --> 00:29:53.980
I'll definitely
treat you to a meal soon.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.250
You must come, alright?

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.180
You're too kind.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:57.850
Ms. Liu.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.020
Ms. Wei.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.860
Ms. Liu, I was just messaging you.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.700
You arrived first.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.010
Chuchu, what a coincidence.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.244
You're meeting a client here too?

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.140
A coincidence?

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.490
Chuchu, I'm sorry,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.140
but the flat I wanted to buy

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.900
has already been signed
by Miss Sun for me.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.050
Ms. Liu,

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.420
didn't we agree earlier
that you'd go through me?

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.180
I even brought the contract today.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.380
Alright, sorry, I've got something on.
I'll go first.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.380
- Alright.
- Ms. Liu.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.266
- Ms. Liu.
- Chuchu, don't do this.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.770
Take care, Ms. Liu.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.780
Ms. Wei,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.180
flat 708 in Xincheng Community
is my listing.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.420
Ms. Liu is my client.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.570
You're stealing my deal outright.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.180
Don't make it sound so harsh.

00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:49.488
The manager told me
to handle the signing.

00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:51.555
If you've got a problem,
take it up with the manager.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.800
What's that supposed to mean?

00:30:52.844 --> 00:30:54.220
Sun Wei, say it clearly.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.220
I've no time to argue with you.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.044
I've got other clients to show flats to.

00:30:59.088 --> 00:31:00.860
Do you think I'm that easy
to push around?

00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:02.700
If you don't explain yourself today,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.010
you're not leaving this room.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.940
The clients all know what you did.

00:31:07.088 --> 00:31:09.090
If the manager
hadn't told me to take this deal,

00:31:09.177 --> 00:31:10.866
it would've fallen through already.

00:31:10.977 --> 00:31:12.333
You'd be facing a complaint too.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.460
What did I do?

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.460
You stole my client
and still think you're in the right?

00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:18.844
If you don't hand this deal
back to me today,

00:31:18.866 --> 00:31:19.911
I won't let it go.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.660
Chuchu.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.500
What's wrong?

00:31:23.022 --> 00:31:25.644
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not go online?

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.810
You left
your drunk sister-in-law in the car.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.900
How irresponsible.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.290
Who would trust you
with a deal after that?

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:59.340
(Convenience Supermarket)

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.900
Dad, I'm back.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.420
You're back.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.422
I'll start cooking now.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.300
I'm not eating.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.940
(Chuchu is the accomplice of the rapist
in the Nancheng assault case.)

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.155
(You're a sinner. You deserve to die.)

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.020
(She left her drunk sister-in-law
in the car!)

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.977
(You really can't trust anyone
these days, outrageous.)

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.380
Just cut it off here.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.380
Yes, just cut along that line.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.090
Along the edge.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.980
Change it.

00:33:54.911 --> 00:33:56.111
Alright, turn on the light.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.740
After the trial's over,

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:37.177
shall we quit smoking
and drinking together?

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.650
Work out and jog?

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.860
And then?

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.650
Live a bit longer.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.010
Live longer for what?

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.170
To see this world.

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.820
To see what it becomes

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.380
after all our effort.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.740
Please let us in.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.570
Step back.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.210
Make some space.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.740
Please don't obstruct our work.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.090
Please cooperate with us.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.130
Don't gather here.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.490
We came all this way.
Can't you make an exception?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.330
Comrades,

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.880
this place is off-limits.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.888
No photography allowed.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.940
Officer,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.940
today's the hearing
for Ye Sibei's case, right?

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.170
I work in legal education.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.740
Please, let us observe.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.010
That's right.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.610
Everyone,

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.210
this case is not open to the public.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.130
No spectators allowed.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.650
Please disperse.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.490
Thank you.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.690
Please cooperate with us.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:41.650
- Thank you.
- Please move aside.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.860
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.900
Alright, thank you all.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.690
Let's go.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.900
What a wasted trip.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.820
Exactly.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.740
Let's go.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.860
After the trial,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.650
I'll invite your family for a meal.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.940
Take it as my apology.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.300
Maybe I'll be the one inviting you

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.940
to apologize to you instead.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.530
Sibei,

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:35.370
don't be afraid.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.780
It's time for us to go in.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.620
Let's go.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.370
Nan,

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:51.930
Mom, and Dad,

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.090
as family members,

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.900
please wait here in the reception area.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.533
Sibei, Chuchu,

00:36:56.622 --> 00:36:58.530
you'll wait outside the courtroom
to be called.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.420
Come in with me first.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.010
We'll definitely win.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.000
We'll wait for you here.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.530
Stay calm.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.490
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.330
Chuchu.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.050
Will we win?

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.900
Don't worry.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.420
According to the law,

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.740
the criminal will be punished.

00:37:53.022 --> 00:37:54.155
Thank you for your effort.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900
Sibei, Chuchu,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.820
two bailiffs will take you

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.010
to the waiting area
to await the summons.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.755
The prosecutor
and I will head into court.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.860
Alright.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.940
Nianwen, let's go.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.210
Chuchu,

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.050
come with me.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.820
Chuchu.

00:38:17.844 --> 00:38:19.133
Thank you for your effort.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.980
After today,

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.900
it'll all be over.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.010
After today, it'll be over.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.620
Ye Sibei.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.690
Come with me.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.820
Chuchu, come with me.
