Im Yu-ri, are you sleeping?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.690
Seriously. Look at the time.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.030
She has no idea
how wild this world is.

Hello?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.880
Hello? Yu-ri?

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.060
Yes, we just reached the scene.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.310
We'll take a look around.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.700
Where are we? In the USA?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.780
How can there be a gunshot report?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.950
What's wrong?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.510
A man...

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.190
Stop right there.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.070
Freeze.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.570
Stop! Don't move.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.820
- Stop, you prick.
- Stop right there.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.200
Hey!

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.830
Damn it.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.920
Stay still.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.380
Freeze.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.050
Damn it.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.840
It's my son.

(Son)

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.800
What's up?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.100
Is this Nam Gyeo-rye's guardian?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.850

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.150

(Exit)

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.990
He's arrested for killing someone?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.490
He didn't kill anyone.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.950
- So hurry up.
- For what?

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.830
How am I supposed to get involved?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.790
Should I say a senior prosecutor
ran there after your call?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.300
Then send Seo Dong-jae at least.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.920
- CEO Nam.
- Just send him as I say, damn it!

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.390
No.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.270
I'm sorry. My apologies, ma'am.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.810
Pass this to Seo Dong-jae.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.060
I'll write a testimony

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.400
that your brother

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.610
caused no harm to my company

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.150
and that he covered
all the damage.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.110
I'm

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.370
begging you, ma'am.

(Boss)

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.970
Yes, boss.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.260
Can you talk? Where are you?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.640
I'm on my way to the dorm...

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.720
That's great.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.980
We got a gun death report
near your location.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.480
What? Gun death?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.690
It's a restricted
development site.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.520
You're the closest.
You should go check.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.110
Me?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.990
Okay.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.740
I'm on my way. Yes.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.820
Bye.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.830
Is this Texas or what? Gun death?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.710
Why would she give me that case?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.390
Huh?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.400
He's...

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.030
CEO Nam's son.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.410
Thank you for your work.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.400
Isn't he handsome?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.290
I heard the suspect was arrested.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.290
Yes.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.120
How?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.130
When we found the body,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.250
the suspect took off,
so we captured him right away.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.550
Here? Next to the body?

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.720
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.720
- What's the weapon?
- A shotgun.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.800
A shotgun?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.010
- You mean a gun?
- Yes.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.100
But we haven't found
the weapon yet.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.560
The suspect was here.
The weapon must be in the area.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.520
Have you identified
the victim yet?

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.940
Captain, let me handle it, please?
Can somebody...

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.110
Hey, don't let him in.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.030
Cap, wait.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.240
- Captain.
- What's wrong?

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.950
Well,

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.320
it's his daughter.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.740
Captain.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.290
Captain.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.130
Captain.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.690
She died on the spot
after getting shot in her back.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.850
A shotgun.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.440
A shotgun?

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.910
Then was it...

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.290
Yes, boss. Gun Death?

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.540
Geez.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.210
It was CEO Nam's influence.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.040
(Nam Wan-seong)

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.800
He was desperate to reach me.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.220
What did he say?

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.430
Then I should ask Prosecutor Seo.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.600
Thank you, ma'am.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.100
Thank you. Bye.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.270
Hey. Wait.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.230
Prosecutor Seo.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.230
We need to talk.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.940
Damn it.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.980
Look. I just want to talk.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.940
Wait. What happened?

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.610
Why did they arrest my son?

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.030
Telling me to leak
the ongoing investigation process?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.990
To the guardian of the suspect who
got arrested without a warrant?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.200
No.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.160
Here's what we'll do.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.710
So...

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.970
The land and everything.
I'll call them all off, yeah?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.180
Goddamn it.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.810
Do you know whom your son killed?

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.270
I can tell you that much.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400
She was

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.740
the captain's daughter
in this police station.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.410
Wait. That's...

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.160
The investigation team will tell
you the rest against your will.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.210
And about the weapon as well.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.080
Wait. I can save my son,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.840
and you can solve your issue...

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.000
Mr. Nam Wan-seong.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.380
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.090
And you as well, Prosecutor Seo.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.260
Where's my son?

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.010
Why are you tormenting
an innocent boy?

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.180
As officers?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.350
Cut the crap.
You're coming with us.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.310
- To where?
- To your house.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.390
(Cheongju Police Station)

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.560
What's this?

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.810
A warrant.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.480
That was quick.
Thank you for your work.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.110
What does that warrant
have to do with it?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.820
Why are you going to my house?
What for?

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.910
Hey, you have a firearm at home,
don't you?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.570
A hunting rifle.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.160
- Why didn't you return it?
- Let's go.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.370
Come with me.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
He said something about
solving a problem.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.420
What was that?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.000
- Can you go with him?
- What? Why?

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.850
Hey, open your mouth.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.810
Hey. Raise your head.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.770
Open.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.410
What the hell are you glaring at?
We haven't even started yet.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.870
Hey.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.250
No matter how much
your attorney costs

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.960
or pretend to be mental,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.550
we're going to send you to prison

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.260
and make you
pay for your crime.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.630
You're 18.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.760
You're not juvenile anymore,
are you?

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.800
Your good old days are now over.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.140
When a kid like you
ends up in prison,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.180
stinky old men will adore you,
you know that?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.230
It wasn't

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.440
me.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.320
I didn't do it.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.400
You didn't do it?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.160
Hey, what the hell was that?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.030
You didn't do it?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160
Sir.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.960
Hey, get up.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.210
Get up, idiot.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.250
Follow me.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.640
Why did you kill her?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.600
Why did you kill her
all the way there?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.600
No surveillance cameras
or witnesses.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.310
Did you think it was perfect
for your crime?

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.310
Wait.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.940
How can the first thing you ask
be why he killed her?

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.520
Not what happened?

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.400
You're implying that he did it.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.650
Who's the one
that got caught running away

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.740
on site covered
in the victim's blood?

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.780
Do you have any idea how
frightened he was to see the body?

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.160
He's only in high school.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.580
If someone chases you
in that situation,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.290
anyone will run away for sure.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.250
He was shocked to find
a dead body by chance,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.330
then the police appeared.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.000
Then you'd ask for help.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.750
Why run away
when he didn't do anything wrong?

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.550
Hey, why did you kill her? Say it.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.840
You called Im Yu-ri

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.050
eight times in a row.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.850
You called her eight times
when she wasn't picking up--

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.350
He kept calling because
she didn't pick up.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.930
What's wrong about calling her
eight times?

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.730
How did he know the victim was
there when she didn't pick up?

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.650
Oh, is that why you tracked
her location?

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.440
It was all on your phone.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.860
You tracked Im Yu-ri's location,
didn't you?

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.900
Because...

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.030
Were you upset? Because she
ignored your calls eight times?

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.660
One doesn't just kill
for knowing the location.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.080
You're grilling him
with speculations.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.210
If you continue--

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.170
Did your father
put the gun in your hand?

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.290
For you to use it
when killing people?

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.750
What are you talking about?

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.380
No matter whose daughter it is,
don't cross the line.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.170
Have you found the weapon yet?

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.680
We're still looking for it.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.800
If he hadn't given it to you,
did you sneak it out?

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.760
Did you know Nam Wan-seong had
a gun license?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.180
The hunting rifle.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.520
Check if it's safe in his house.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.530
I've lost it.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.830
It's gone.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.710
Damn it.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.420
It looks like the father needs
an attorney too.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.550
If you still haven't found it yet,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.180
do you think he abandoned it
somewhere far away?

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.350
Why did he come back to the scene?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.720
I'm not sure.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.100
Why check it?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.770
If you've found the gun,

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.230
compare the number on it
to the license.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.990
Oh. I know.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.740
You couldn't find the weapon.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.760
Wait. One second.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.520
I'll come back early tomorrow.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.060
Don't say a word.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.940
Not when you're alone, okay?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.440
You can talk to him later.
You're dismissed.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.400
Mr. Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.610
Let's talk.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.200
Look at me, will you?

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.210
Was that you?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.960
What happened to your face?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.670
Did that guy do that to you?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.670
Is that why Yu-ri was bruised
and wounded?

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.260
And you chased her
all the way to the hospital?

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.840
I fell while I was in a rush.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.260
What are you going to do now?

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.760
You said they saw your face.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.600
Yet that wasn't enough,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.810
you brought a gun to kill her?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.770
You were carrying a gun
in front of your house, no?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.110
I saw you carrying it,
so spill it out.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.690
Where's the gun?

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.990
Where did you hide it?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.160
Huh?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.040
Detective Jung.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.960
Take him to jail, please.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.340
Come with me.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.180
Wait.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.560
What gun?
What do you know about this?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.060
Oh.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.690
It looked like
a tennis racket bag.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.730
It was about this big.
It was green.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.730
Around 8:30 p.m.,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.150
the suspect was carrying it
in front of his house and

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.150
I happened to see it.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.700
I see.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.200
Your next question is
why I went to his house?

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.910
Why I went to the suspect's house

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.670
even before the incident occurred?

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.710
You know it.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.540
- Can I have your business card?
- My business card?

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.380
I'll ask you to check it
if we find the bag.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.510
Okay.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.760
What's your name, detective?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.930
Detective Kim Hyung-woo.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.770
I'm Seo Dong-jae.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.310
Are you on Captain Im's team?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.150
Were you close to the victim?

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.610
No.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.440
She was my captain's daughter.
That's about it.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.070
Right.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.280
Okay.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.330
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.280
That lunatic took it for real.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.410
- Yes, CEO Nam.
- Where are you?

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.710
I just left the police station.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.920
Sir, the police said the gun--

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.750
Go back and find out
where he put it.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.750
Tell him to confess
where he hid the gun

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.420
and I'll handle it!

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.890
Last night in Cheongju,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.770
a high school student died
in a horrible gun accident.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.940
The police went to check

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.610
after receiving a gunshot report,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.070
but the victim was
already found dead.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.900
You're back. Have you had lunch?

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.740
- Don't mind me.
- Died from excessive bleeding.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.490
The place you see behind me is

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.790
where an 18-year-old Ms. Im died

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.290
by a gunshot last night.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.080
When the police went to check
after a gunshot was reported,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.300
they arrested a male suspect

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.670
about 50m away from the scene.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.970
However, the suspect is
remaining silent

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.800
about his criminal intent.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.680
On the other hand,
the suspect's father

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.270
did not return the hunting rifle,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.860
yet the police station in charge
was not aware of it.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.980
Some say the negligence
of the gun management

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.860
by the police may have caused it.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.990
In response...

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.450
I heard you received a chunk.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.290
Yes.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.660
Did someone else receive it?

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.460
I had no idea it'd arrived.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.330
I met Mr. Kang.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.170
You went all the way to Seoul
to pick it up?

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.300
In person?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.890
He was here.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.350
Has he ever visited himself
before to deliver the goods?

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.980
What?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.360
The food is getting cold.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.210
Then we can start selling again.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.090
When are you meeting Mr. Won
for a deal?

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.800
When he begs me.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.300
I knew kids these days were scary,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.390
but I never expected to see a gun.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.600
They're way ahead of our time.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.270
The daughter of a man who visited
our building just the other day

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.640
died like that.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.690
We should show our condolences.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.690
We may not know the victim,
but we should still go.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.230
It's the daughter of a detective
in our district.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.690
We know her already.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.150
You've all seen her before
at least once.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.450
We've seen Captain Im's
daughter before?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.910
You know the part-timer
at the bowling alley?

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.030
Did you know she was his daughter?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.910
No, I was surprised
to see her portrait too.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.750
Did you visit her funeral already?

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.830
Yes.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.840
Who wants to be in charge
when we get this case?

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.230
It's never easy just because
the suspect is obvious.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.350
The police have emotions too.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.350
Check the sentence.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.730
We can't even give him a long
sentence because he's a student.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.650
He killed a captain's daughter.
You can't be loose either.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.150
I don't think
the suspect is obvious.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.030
Why not?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.660
The suspect who was arrested
on site didn't have the weapon.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.740
Maybe he threw it out.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.000
If it was abandoned too far
to find it,

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.790
why did he come back
to the scene?

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.210
Do I have to remind you
that the suspect always

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.880
- returns to the site?
- But--

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.670
But, my ass. You're just a newbie.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.720
The suspect was covered
in the victim's blood.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.260
What?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.430
If he came back like that, he was
basically asking to be arrested.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.310
Maybe he dropped
something important?

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.480
No.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.100
Nothing important was found yet.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.530
How do you know everything
so well?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.320
Did CEO Nam tell you?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.740
Hey, Jo Byung-gun.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.700
Oh, I was just joking.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.120
Boss.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.830
When you told me to go check it,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.170
did you know
it was Captain Im's daughter?

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.130
No.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.760
I knew you called me

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.590
because it was a gun death, right?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.890
Yes.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.180
It's her and CEO Nam's
collaboration for sure.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.730
Get him out.
Then I'll call it off.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.650
The land and everything.
I'll call them all off, yeah?

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.270
They thought I'd be helpless
because of the land.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.940
It's true that it's a picky case.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.570
If we assign it to a newbie,

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:24.990
the police would think
we're not taking it seriously

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.910
when a detective's
daughter's dead.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.280
It can't be someone who keeps
picking a fight with the police.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.500
So a veteran

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.340
who gets along in the world
should be assigned.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.090
Oh.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.890
That will be me.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.430
I'll take the case, boss.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.480
Did you all know Prosecutor Seo
became the model prosecutor?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.070
Because we haven't had the awards
due to COVID-19,

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.860
this time, it'll be held
in the supreme office.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.700
You're dismissed.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.930
Prosecutor Seo.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.230
Yes.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.730
(Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae)

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.150
Prosecutor Seo, did you check
the photo? Is that the one?

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.030
Yes, that's the bag,
but why did the victim have it?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.950
That's my question.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.280
Yu-ri used to work here.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.290
- The bowling alley?
- You know it already?

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.080
That means the suspect grabbed
the gun from his house

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.750
and gave it to Yu-ri.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.090
But he

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.510
took the gun back
and shot her with it.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.800
Yu-ri first received it
without a clue

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.220
then she realized it was a gun.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.470
So what if the boy took it back

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.930
from her by force?

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.640
Kill her because she found out
that it was a gun?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.600
Because the victim accused him
of having a gun?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.650
That doesn't make any sense.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.230
We've proved that the suspect

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.980
took the gun bag
to the bowling alley.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.650
He paid the cab with his card
when he went there.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.990
Just a few hours
before the incident.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.450
Other evidence says

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.490
the suspect gave it to Yu-ri.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.660
What other evidence?

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.830
Was Gyeo-rye close to Yu-ri?

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.330
I'm not sure about that,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.090
but Yu-ri was close to Ji-hyun.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.210
I wasn't close to her. I just
sat next to her a few times.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.970
You should ask Kim Ye-jin.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.590
Gyeo-rye used to wait for Yu-ri
after school.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.180
How did Gyeo-rye and Yu-ri look
together?

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.850
I think he liked her.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.980
But Yu-ri...

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.520
Maybe he became angry

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.360
because Yu-ri wouldn't accept
his heart.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.820
Yet, that still doesn't explain

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.650
why the gun bag was moved

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.410
from Im Yu-ri to Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.030
Enough with the bag.
What about the weapon?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.030
Not yet.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.790
Even though you searched
all night long?

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.410
Yes, even though we searched
all night long.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.540
We're expanding the area.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.040
Anything new with Nam Gyeo-rye?

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.380
He won't say a word.
His mouth is shut tight.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.340
Okay.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.800
Perhaps they traded it
in the bowling alley?

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.260
They wouldn't have done that
in front of everyone.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.020
Damn it. I'll have to go check.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.240
(Spare Bowling Center)

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.580
(Temporarily closed)

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.120
Shoot.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.930
Huh?

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.510
Excuse me.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.180
Hello?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.730
Excuse me.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.940
Wait.
I'm from the prosecution service.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.990
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.210
You remind me of a grocery store
owner from my old town.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.250
You can have all you want.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.260
Oh, I'm good.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.150
Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.530
We've been here many times before.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.120
This is the first time
to see it closed.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.580
How can I open it

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.880
after what happened
to that young girl?

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.300
What a world.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.340
Thank you for this.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.480
Are you okay? Sir...

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.510
You shouldn't drink with...

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.480
You shouldn't smoke either.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.150
The police came by

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.610
and took the surveillance camera
and all.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.200
And they asked me

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.120
about Yu-ri's friend.
The yellow hair.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.910
Did that yellow hair

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.670
come here to meet Yu-ri yesterday?

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.170
I happened to leave
early yesterday.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.220
You wouldn't know if the blond
gave her the gun.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.520
- The gun?
- Yes.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.060
The police found that
he brought a gun here in a bag

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.690
from a surveillance camera.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.070
No, it's okay.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.860
I called the cab.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.710
Excuse me?

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.800
Sir?

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.920
Sir?

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.850
I need to get some sleep.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:48.930
What?

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.180
No.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.770
Sir?

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.020
Finish your sentence first.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.400
Sir?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.900
Sir, can you...

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.200
There he is.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.620
Hello.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.710
Where's Mr. Seo?

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.340
He's working outside.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.800
He's always so busy.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.590
After you, ma'am.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.640
Go ahead. Something came up.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.070
When did you get it?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480
I had no idea.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.530
Geum-ho picked it up by himself.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.530
When are you resuming the deals?
And where?

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.990
I don't know yet.
The address changes every day.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.830
I'll let you know
when it's decided.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.870
Yes.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.500
Just wait until I wipe your ass,
you jerks.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.350
(Sunkookkwan)

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.810
What the hell?

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.520
CEO Nam, a word, please.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.070
Isn't the murder suspect your son?

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.660
Why did you not return the gun?

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.080
Did you know the gun was gone?

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.950
Any word to the victim's family?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.470
It won't be recorded
while I'm here.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.180
Feel free to talk to him.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.700
Son.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.620
Where's the gun?

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.870
I need to know where it is,
so I can get rid of it.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.040
Where did you hide it?

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.750
I didn't hide it.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.550
I didn't do it.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.720
Are you not going to
tell me either?

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.220
I'm not mad at you,
so tell me already.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600
I didn't do it.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.100
Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.810
Look at me.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.270
Look at me, Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.860
Nam Gyeo-rye, look...

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.610
Look at your dad, you prick.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.790
Keep that attitude.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.790
No matter what they say,
just say no.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.540
Even if you threaten you,
say you didn't do it.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.130
I'll take care of the rest.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.840
Okay.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.920
I also chose your prosecutor.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.260
A guy named Seo Dong-jae
will be here.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.180
He's coming here to set you free,

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.050
so endure it
for just one more day, okay?

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.760
Look.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.890
You're in Cheongju.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.150
Even prosecutors move

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.770
like pawns upon my order
in Cheongju.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.320
So no need to be scared.
Whatever they say,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.150
keep your mouth shut.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.780
The prosecutor will dismiss
everything, okay?

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.530
Okay.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.540
So

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.460
where's the gun?

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.630
I told you. I didn't do it.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.300
You really didn't?

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.100
I... I didn't kill her.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.110
That's all that matters.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.990
You didn't do it.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.830
Yes. It's going to be all right.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.330
Mr. Nam Wan-seong?

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.670
- Take him.
- Follow me.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.670
Will you come with me?

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.010
To where? Why?

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.800
For violating the firearm
safety management.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.930
You haven't written a report yet.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.100
It won't take long, sir.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.060
Well,
we'll have to see about that.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.350
Wait.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.770
I'll tell you what to write
in the report.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.030
Oh, hello.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.030
You're finally here.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.200
Are you here to meet my son?

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.910
Yes, of course.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.790
Now I'm finally relieved.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.000
Have you talked to your boss too?

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.590
Yes, of course.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.630
He happens to be in there.
You should go talk to him.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.510
Gyeo-rye is waiting for you too.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.680
You told him about me?

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.720
Of course.
You're the prosecutor in charge.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.770
The case hasn't been
forwarded yet,

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.060
and the prosecutor in charge has
been determined already?

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.360
As you know,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.030
it's a special case.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.410
What's so special about it?

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.910
The victim was
the captain's family.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120
It sure is special.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.830
Very special

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.340
and very important, yeah?

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.470
If the suspect knows me,

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.260
it shouldn't take long.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.010
Bye now.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.760
Please do your best.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.220
Thank you.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.390
- Come with me.
- Watch out.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.900
This way.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.670
A guy named Seo Dong-jae
will be here.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.550
He's coming here to set you free,

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.340
so endure it
for just one more day, okay?

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.880
(Seo Dong-jae)

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.720
Are you keeping your mouth shut
without saying a word?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.730
For what?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.690
Thinking your dad got your back?

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.730
You think his petty power
can save your ass?

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.940
If that's why you're keeping
your mouth shut,

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.360
stay that way.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.910
What can I do?
You're asking to doom your life.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.450
Even prosecutors move

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.580
like pawns upon my order
in Cheongju.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.080
You're in the center
of everything.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.210
All evidence is pointing at you.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.250
So no need to be scared.
Whatever they say,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.210
keep your mouth shut.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.670
You're the murderer.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.590
The prosecutor will dismiss
everything, okay?

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.260
Both evidence and suspicion
prove this case better.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.010
Yet you say no excuse

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.760
or deny your crime?

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.430
That works for me. I already have
enough on my plate as it is now.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.390
In fact, I've seen you

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.190
stalking her.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.570
She even sneaked
into my hospital room

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.110
when I was a complete stranger
just to avoid you.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.610
I'm going to prosecute you

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.740
and reveal every detail in court.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.740
How much you disgusted her.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.580
How you battered that small girl.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.620
I didn't do it.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.830
What do you mean no?
Stop getting on my nerves.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.210
Do you want me to do this
the old way?

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.790
I'm going to prolong it. Why?

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.840
Because you're graduating soon.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.050
I'll wait
until you become an adult

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.800
and give you life.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.130
I didn't kill...

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.180
The murderer who killed
a high school girl in 2010.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.430
He received life
after becoming an adult.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.930
The murderer who assaulted and
killed a middle schooler in 2016.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.890
He received life
on top of aggravated assault.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.730
I'll do the same for you.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.190
When a kid like you
ends up in prison,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.440
stinky old men will adore you,
you know that?

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.910
Yu-ri...

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.490
She said she'd sell everything
at once.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.170
We picked it up at the terminal.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.840
We weren't planning to do that.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.760
We were too scared to return it.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.970
Then Yu-ri...

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.560
She wanted to sell it
for the last time.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.640
I tried to stop her.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.310
Sell what?

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.860
The drug.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.860
The drug? The drug drug?

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.240
Where did you get the drug?
And how?

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.660
We picked it up.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.910
From where?

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.910
The terminal.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.250
We tried to return the bag...

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.460
The drug was in the bag.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.040
And Yu-ri was next to you.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.960
You don't know
who the bag belonged to?

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.170
If you found that,
you should've reported it

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.300
or thrown it out.
How could you sell it?

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.350
How can you be so thoughtless?

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.680
How did you sell it?

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.930
I received orders via app
and left it in designated places.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.850
Yu-ri.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.350
(Want to buy 3 doses)

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.700
So she went to sell it
for the last time

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.990
and got killed?

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.120
In the place she meant to meet the
one who offered to buy everything?

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.540
Who was it?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.290
What do you mean you don't know?
You were there too.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.500
You were with her.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.790
If you are...

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.380
If what you just said is true,

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.630
you ran for your life alone
when Yu-ri was dying.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.720
No, I told her not to do it.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.470
We should drop it
because it was too dangerous.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.520
But she went alone in secret,
so I followed her.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.770
That's why I gave her the gun
in case she might get hurt.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.280
In case Yu-ri might get hurt.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.430
Look at me. Look.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.510
How much did you have left?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.220
The amount Yu-ri took
for the last deal.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.110
- Did you find it with the body?
- No.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.190
Did you receive orders through
the messenger on your phone?

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.400
So did you delete everything?

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.570
I set it to disappear
after some time.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.610
What's the chance of the bag owner

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.370
being the last person
who offered to buy everything?

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.330
He doesn't

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.620
know about us.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.160
Hey, you stupid idiot.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.000
With that amount,
the owner of the bag

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.750
must've been from some clique.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.590
He's not selling it by himself.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.460
When he lost it,
he couldn't sell anymore.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.800
He'd be suspected
and was desperate to find his stuff.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.130
You think a drug clique
couldn't find you?

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.760
In this small town?

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.810
The date and time.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.230
When did you find the bag?

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.020
September 7.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.150
Around 2 p.m..

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.150
- Where are you going?
- To the terminal.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.780
Captain,
this prick opened his mouth.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240
Yu-ri was...

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.970
Let's go. Hurry up, please.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:41.810
Damn it.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.940
Shoot.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.070
That lunatic...

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.370
Shoot.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.700
What about the drugs?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.580
Freaking scumbag.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.180
Making things up.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.300
How dare he try to frame her?

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.300
The owner of the bag
must've been from some clique.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.170
When he lost it,
he couldn't sell anymore.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.220
He'd be suspected.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.970
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.560
and disappeared recently.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.600
The new kind of ecstasy
that suddenly disappeared.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.980
No, it's a simple supply issue.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.980
Not because they were worried
about us.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.060
Were they the reason
for the shortage of supplies?

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.280
The new kind of ecstasy.
What was its name again?

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.190
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago...

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.450
Purple.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080
Oh, hello.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.380
Can you take me
to the security room?

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.050
This way.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.170
Thank you.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.560
Hello?

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.560
- Nam Gyeo-rye wasn't lying.
- Did you find the drug?

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.850
Not the drug, but money.
In the victim's room.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.270
Okay.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.650
I called you
because it might be true

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.070
that they found it
at the terminal.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.690
Okay.
I'm at the terminal right now.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.110
I'm on my way. See you soon.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.780
Wait.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.660
Do you know by any chance
if they were selling Purple?

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.160
What? What does this
have to do with Purple?

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.160
What? It can't be Purple
or something?

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:04.250
I'll meet you there soon.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.500
What the hell?
How far is this going?

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:19.810
I can't wait until the bus leaves.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.350
Let's just take the cab.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.520
To Daejeon? Are you crazy?

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.270
You think it's not crazy to go
all the way to Daejeon for bread?

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.690
If we just take the cab...

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.980
Goddamn it.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.070
What?
