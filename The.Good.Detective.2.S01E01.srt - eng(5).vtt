Why won't you listen? Why?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.740
Why won't you do as I say?

help me, please.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.640
It's one of these guys, right?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.810
Which one is it?

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.900
Isn't it...

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.800
better to let it just slide?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.130
- So you're saying it is one of them.
- I don't know.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.770
It's been a long time, so I can't remember the face very well.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.410
Hey, you said that you saw them last weekend, along with the East Gangnam gang members.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.700
It hasn't been that long.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.020
I just ran into them in a hallway. I really can't remember.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.200
Look closely one more time.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.680
If you can't be absolutely sure, I won't force you to say it.

I'm sorry.

Yes, Team Leader.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.180
Go to the hospital and check the victim's situation, and make it an MIU (Metropolitan Investigation Unit) case.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.570
Also, don't let the local jurisdiction meddle.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.110
Understood?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.710
Just focus on that.

I'll take care of the rest as soon as I arrive.

- Let's handle that first. Mosquito clamp.

Higher.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.990
What was the situation at the scene when you picked her up?

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.740
I'm not sure. The patient was in a dangerous state,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.370
so we didn't have a chance to check the site.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.300
[Team Leader Choi Yong Geun]

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.880
I understand.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.200
I'll get in contact again if there's anything else I need to confirm.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.530
- Hello?
- Victim's status.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.960
She has severe internal ruptures. The assault appears to have been serious.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.540
I'm asking if she's alive!

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.850
Yes. It looks like her life has been spared.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.620
Okay, that's good.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.950
- You dealt properly with the local police force in charge, yes?
- Yes.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.240
Okay.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.610
Wait there until I arrive. Don't do anything.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.850
Don't ruin things by fooling around.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.390
Team Leader, this case isn't just a simple assault and battery. It's attempted murder.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.050
Didn't you understand me? Don't act up, you punk!

Excuse us. Coming through.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.880
Show me the CCTV security camera footage.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.830
This is a place where the customer's privacy is important.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.690
As such, we don't have security cameras.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.790
- Who cleaned up the crime scene?
- That is...

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.770
I guess it was our contracted cleaning company.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.940
Did you know that arbitrarily touching a crime scene can be counted towards destroying or damaging evidence?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.400
I wasn't involved in it.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.300
In addition, the assault occurred while I was away.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.960
Please excuse me.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.180

[TJ - Woo Tae Ho | TJ Group Legal Team - Team Leader]

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.100
I heard moaning pretty soon after I went into the restroom.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.540
I thought it was strange that a woman's moaning could be heard coming from a men's restroom,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.160
so I opened the door and checked. There was a woman lying next to the toilet.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.430
I called 911 myself because it was an emergency.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.360
What was the state of the victim?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.000
It looked like she had been assaulted.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.140
Please explain more specifically.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.440
She had numerous bruises on her face.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.160
I think she had a bit of a bloody nose, maybe.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.500
Her organs were ruptured, and her genitals were severely damaged.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.350
When she arrived at the hospital, she had already lost too much blood.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.170
Just a bit of a nose bleed doesn't cause excessive loss of blood.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.070
I'm...

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.820

Hey, Oh Ji Hyeok,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.160
did I order you to wait at the hospital until I arrive, or did I not?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.800
And why didn't you answer your phone?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.800
I was just doing the basic required investigation.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.110
And about the phone, I couldn't answer it because I was getting a witness testimony.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.740
Are you the person who made the report?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.380
Yes.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.000
You, leave. I'll get the rest of the testimony.

There are a few things missing from your testimony, so I would like to go over it with you.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.160
Why were you at that club at the time of the crime?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.730
Isn't it pretty clear why people go there?

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.860
Is there an accompanying person who can confirm that?

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.370
I can't tell you that.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.780
I went to the club with him.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.950
We were having a drink when that incident happened.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.840

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.510
The focus of the perpetrator is on murder rather than sexual assault, which is typical for serial killers that take pleasure in killing.

Also, seeing that he uses the same methods to murder, there's a big possibility he likes to show off.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.210
No matter what other people say, don't be swayed.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.260
We're the only ones that can catch this bastard. Okay?

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.130
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.370
Request an urgent inspection as soon as any evidence comes out.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.640
And don't even think about leaving the scene until something substantial is found. Understood?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.800
- Yes, sir.
- Get going.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.490
I'm authorized, I'm a detective.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.770
I'll show you later. Later.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.940
Hello,

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.530
I'm Incheon West Police Department's Violent Crime Division 2 Team Leader...

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.200
- Woo Bong Sik.
- And?

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.010
Well... This is our jurisdiction,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.910
and the report was called in to us first.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.840
You didn't bring a herd of your people just because it's your jurisdiction, did you?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.840
N-No. I told them to wait down there for now.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.060
We have enough investigators, so until we ask for your cooperation,

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.490
go back to your station and wait.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.380
It will only confuse the investigation.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.640
Hey! Maknae!
(Youngest in the group)

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.820
Properly control the site!

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.950
Random people are coming in and leaving useless footprints!

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.200
Make sure you control the crime scene better.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.120
How is it?

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.760
Did you check the body?

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.880
It looks like it's been only about two or three days since the murder.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.440
- When was it that we caught that thief?
- Three days ago?

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.330
Wait, then Kim Hyeong Bok, that jerk, could be the serial killer.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.470
Did you tell the MIU that we caught a thief around here about three days ago?

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.020
Oh Ji Hyeok,

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.700
you said you caught that thief, right? How did it feel?

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.750
If he killed a person, he must've tried to run away with everything he had.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.830
- I'm not sure.
- Did you tell MIU about it or not?

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.590
They wouldn't give me a chance, those bastards.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.090
What can I even say when they're treating me like some peddler?

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.530
What if he's the serial killer? How are you going to deal with it if it comes to that?

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.900
Why would I deal with...?

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.440
So why did you let a guy we caught go so easily?

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.880
If we had kept him, we would've been the guys who caught the serial killer!

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.290
Can we still not reach Kim Hyeong Bok?

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.170
No, we can't. It says the phone number doesn't exist.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.190
I think he changed his phone.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.900
If this all goes south, we might get blamed.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.140
Let's go back to the station for now. This isn't something we can decide on our end.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.760
Okay.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.170
Find anything?

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.360
I think there was a fight over here.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.670
There's a trace of someone rolling down over there,

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.820
and this was here.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.260
Violent Crimes Division Team 2... You...

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.770
What's up with you again?

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.780
You all kept it quiet for a while.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.540
Why are you all out to get me? You idiots.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.390
Three years ago,

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.460
there was a serial killer that got away,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.780
and every chief from each police station along the escape route was fired. You know that, right?

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.780
But that's...

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.820
a little bit different, right?

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.430
It's not like we lost them because we made a mistake.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.850
It was just due to some coincidental circumstance...

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.030
It's not a mistake?

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.270
Let's say he was the perpetrator,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.290
and later, if people ask why we let them go, what are you going to do?

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.090
Are you going to say that a boar chased you all just because it smelled some crap?

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.510
There's no other way.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.200
Get Kim Hyeong Bok back here.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.950
Do whatever you can to get him back.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:19.280
In case the MIU catches the drift and gets him first...

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.620
Hey, Sim Dong Wook,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.610
- you're the youngest, right?
- Yes.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.810
How long did you work as a policeman?

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.710
Three years.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.760
Won't it be unfair?

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.850
That you would lose your job at the same time as me, who has worked for 25 years?

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.480
So freaking dirty, damn it.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.300
Hyeongnim, over here.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.500
[Chinese Restaurant Menu]

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.350
Aigoo, what did my Hyeong Bok do to deserve this?
[Two-wheeled Vehicle Certificate of Usage Report]

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.150
Has he committed a huge crime?

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.850
Please give us your son's contact info if you know it.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.500
This might be nothing if we can get a hold of him.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.240
If you hide it, it'll make things more serious.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.840
I don't know. I don't. If I knew, I would tell you!

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.480
What should we do with this?

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.970
This hiking knife is not the right one.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.210
The knife used for the crime was as thin as a razor blade.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.570
The NFS is assuming it was a sashimi knife or a cutter type.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.800
Let's take it for now, though.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.550
Did my Hyeong Bok... kill a p-person?

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.820
Well... let me─

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.040
No, no. No.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.460
My boy is not that kind of person.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.910
No... He can't even kill an insect.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.080
I-I mean,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.050
I know he goes around doing bad things,

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:12.270
but he would never, ever kill a person.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.800
Wait a moment.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.610
My boy, he even went to church until he was in 9th grade.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.370
H-H-Here.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.500
There's got to be a picture somewhere.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.200
H-Here, take a look.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.440
Here it is.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.800
See, here's a photo of him going to ch-church.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.860
He even prayed before he ate, too.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.040
How could a person like that do such a thing? He would be punished by God.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.760
Yes, I see.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.060
Can we keep this and take a look?

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.900
Look closely through the album, and if there's anyone he took a photo with more than twice, contact them.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.720
As for the computer, search it thoroughly and print anything that could be evidence.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.050
- Okay. I don't think we should expect much, though.
- Why?

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:17.590
Well, there's no password on it or anything.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.890
If he had anything to hide, he wouldn't have left it like this.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.110
Don't be so sure and try the best you can.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.590
You two, instead of returning to the station, go ask around.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.580
He grew up here, so if you say his name, most people will know him.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.530
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.760
Dong Wook, you stay here in case he comes back.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.480

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.270
Okay.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.800
Then we'll accept it graciously.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.830
If... Hyeong Bok contacts you, please let us know.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.060
Of course.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.140
do you r-really think Hyeong Bok...

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.480
killed a p-person?

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.270
No. I don't think he did.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.850
Right?

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.140
He didn't, right?

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.400
You think so too, right?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.430
How likely do you think Kim Hyeong Bok is the serial killer?

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.910
We can't exclude it.

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:48.880
There must be a reason why he went into hiding after suddenly changing his cell number.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.610
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.290
I think it'll be all twisted up again.

Yes, Hyeong Bok bought this from my store not too long ago.

I see. Do you know Kim Hyeong Bok then?

Yes, I know him because he's a local.

Did he tell you why he bought the motorcycle?

Well...

there are some people who buy them just to crash into things and get money.

Insurance fraud, I see.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.220
But he hasn't brought it in to get it fixed from an accident yet,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.900

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.380
please give us a call.

They must have the original. Can't they copy it?

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.820
I think they blocked any outflow of it.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.690
They won't let the local detectives get into the scene, and they're blocking us from seeing the CCTV footage?

Contrary to the expectations of the legal community that no prison sentence would be imposed,

it seems that the evidence presented by the prosecution served as the basis

Wouldn't he have left as far as possible away from the murder scene?

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.840
Don't you think he could've been confused since he wasn't used to this area?

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.040
It was night, and on a mountainside, too.

The culprit was thorough enough not to leave a single piece of evidence up until the last crime.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.080
He would've thoroughly understood the geography of the area before committing the crime.

He wouldn't make such a mistake.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.290

ate at a Chinese restaurant nearby, and went to the crime scene.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.690

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.540
Yes. The owner is Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.490
Did you try contacting him?

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.790
We can't reach him. I think he changed to a burner phone.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.810
What about his house? You must have his address.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.370
We went there, but everything was taken already.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.390
- By whom?
- Violent Crimes Division Team 2 from Incheon.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.250
How did they find out about Kim Hyeong Bok?

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:42.750
Seoul MIU contacted us for support.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.550
Suddenly?

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.800
Why? For what reason?

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.540
According to our team, they are chasing Kim Hyeong Bok as well.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.930
Do they know that we let him go after catching him?

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.220
We don't think they know that much yet,

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.580
but we think that they've confirmed that we're also looking for him.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.050
Hello?

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.870
Yes. Yes, we're at the station right now.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.830
Can you just wait a moment? I'll be down in a few seconds.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.100
It's the team leader of MIU. What should we do?

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.500
What should you do?

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.910
You guys caused this, so take care of it.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.790
Yes, okay. Then I'll tell them truthfully.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.060
Just leave me out of it.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.050
Tell them that you guys were messing around without reporting to me, and then this happened.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.350
Wouldn't they think that doesn't make sense?

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.840
A huge case where a serial murderer is involved...

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.920
Would they believe that we didn't report to the chief?

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.000
Just keep insisting.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.820
Seoul MIU has the best detectives in Korea.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.240
Do you think insisting will work?

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.240
So you're saying that you must rope me in just to feel better?

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.740
No, that's not it.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.710
Okay, we'll do whatever it takes to make the violent crimes team

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:11.490
the only ones to be covered in crap.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.540
Hey, wait.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.670
Long live the chief.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.100
Y-Y-You, what should I do with you?

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.200
I'm so angry.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.200
What should we do?

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.200
Should we truly make it so that it's only us who are covered in crap─

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.530
Are you also ridiculing me?

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.030
No, how would I dare?

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:40.980
It's just that I'm worried that your good image will be tainted.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.650
You jerk!

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:46.020
You're the same as him!

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.270
You guys just go ahead and meet with them.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.360
I'll think of a solution.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.850
What about the chief?

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:04.420
He said to wait so he could think.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.370
That's enough.

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.370
What's enough? Being a chief doesn't provide a solution.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.960
He'll just figure out a way to get out of it.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.960
Do you know what his nickname was when he was leader of the investigation department? Lightning Rod.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.680
He never runs away from the lighting, he makes the lighting miss.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.600
What brings you here at such a late hour?

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.600
I would like to apologize for what happened at the crime scene last time.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.700
You probably already know, but it's such a sensitive case,

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:32.090
and there's a lot of pressure on me, so I was out of my mind.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:33.440
We understand.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.540
You probably already received a brief report, but the reason we're here is─

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.200
Hey, Maknae, what are you doing?

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.480
Important guests came from Seoul, you should bring out coffee or something.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.500
Okay.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.480
What would you like?

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.540
Ahmukina.
(T/N: He has a strong country accent. He said, "whatever is fine.")

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.500
We don't have Ahmukina.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.790
I checked earlier, we only have instant coffee and a single green tea left.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.630
Both of you can't have green tea.

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.110
Then give both of us coffee.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.360
Hey, treat them kindly, okay?

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.220
If you want to get anywhere, make yourselves look good.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.870
Who knows? Maybe you'll be chosen to go to Seoul MIU.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:09.590
It's not like you'll get anywhere just because you work at Seoul MIU.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.800
They just go around with their heads held high.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.000
We're all just pigs, right?

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.500
We were checking the security cameras near the scene on the day of the crime─

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.110
Ah, I remember. The CCTVs.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.300
- Hey, Byeon Ji Woong,
- Yes?

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.570
Did you request cooperation from the district office, or no?

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.750
Well, this assho─

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.120
I mean, this person who's a nice little dog...

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.790
Apparently, he told them never to hand it over to us.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.990
You should've brought it no matter what! It's our jurisdiction!

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:44.500
We should help them in some way to help our station save face!

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:48.720
How can we help when we have nothing? All we know is what we saw on the media.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.200
We should find out on our own.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.090
If we don't have the CCTV recordings, find a witness. If we're not allowed on the crime scene,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.380
we should sneak in and take photos of the scene like thieves.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.310
That's dangerous. There are so many boars out there.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:03.580
Why are you talking about boars? You shouldn't go that far.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.840
Why are you chasing Kim Hyeong Bok, huh?

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.490
Do you know something or what?

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.760
Even if you're an important guest, let's be respectful, yeah?

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.360
Even a dog doesn't bark randomly in someone else's house.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:21.180
Who's Detective Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.310
It's me.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.040
Why did you do a background check on Kim Hyeong Bok on the day of the crime?

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.140
I probably did it because I needed to...

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.290
I'm asking the reason for that!

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.300
There must be something you're hiding from us, and I get it.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.290
I understand you're investigating on your own because you all want to catch the culprit.

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.750
But what if, while ignoring the principles and working on your own,

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:42.300
things go wrong? What are you going to do?

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.850
I won't say too much.

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.220
Hand over Kim Hyeong Bok's data to us.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:52.580
If you do that, we'll ignore the problems that have happened in the process.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.280
I won't hold you accountable. I promise.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.940
Everyone, attention!

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.510
Hey, Violent Crime Division Team 2!

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:01.640
What are you doing?

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.570
My uncle called again!

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.910
Hey Kang Do Chang, you said you would get him fast.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.430
- Excuse me?
- The ginseng thief!

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.810
Right, well... we're trying, but...

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.520
You said you're investigating the suspect.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.890
You said Kim Hyeong Bok or whatever was a strong suspect.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:26.120
Yeah, so we went through his house thoroughly,

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.340
but we couldn't even find a bellflower root*, let alone any ginseng.
(Bellflower root looks like ginseng)

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.500
What? So you're telling me that it was wrong?

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.870
We have a few more suspects other than Kim Hyeong Bok, so if we investigate, we'll find them soon.

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:40.590
Catch him for sure. When I applied to college,

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.040
Uncle paid for the admission fee by selling ginseng from the ginseng field.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.390
Catch him, and please save face for me. Okay?

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.730
Yes, sir!

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.340
Who are these people?

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.230
Hello, I'm Team Leader Jang Gi Jin from Seoul MIU.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:00.820
You must be so busy. What brings you here?

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.710
They're looking for Kim Hyeong Bok, too.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.000
Why?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.020
Is the Seoul MIU looking for my uncle's ginseng field thief?

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.980
[Jeong Hui Joo]

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.530
[White Gown Serial Murder Case]

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.410
- Team Leader.
- Check the security camera.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:24.200
The color and the design are exactly the same.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.930
We checked with the company, and they said they are the only place that makes this design.

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.750
Let me see the button that was found on the crime scene.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.690
Send out a national manhunt for Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.370
That one.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.030
7332.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.070
7332.

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:02.100
It's a different number than the one that's registered.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.990
Don't you think the license plate is too new compared to the state of the motorcycle?

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.970
Maybe he just changed the license plate.

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:10.160
- Probably not.
- How can you be certain?

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.960
Kim Hyeong─

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.000
Are you the owner?

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.700
Yes.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.680
Kim Hyeong Bok is not smart enough to change the license plate.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.510
You felt the same about him, too, didn't you?

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.520
Don't judge people by just seeing them once.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.140
Who knows, there might be a demon hiding inside Kim Hyeong Bok.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:37.490
Do you really think Kim Hyeong Bok is a serial killer?

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:42.680
I said I don't know! Am I a god? How am I supposed to know what's hiding inside him?

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.980
I'm sorry, we're not open yet.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:03.120
Just make one ramen for us. We have to eat quickly and leave.

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.500
Hello.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.050
Hi.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.000
Why are you looking for ramen at a chicken restaurant?

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.860
I'll give you money. I'll pay for a whole chicken.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.290
- Thank you for the food.
- Sure.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.030
Shall I fry up some chicken for you?

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:25.740
No, it's fine. We don't have time to eat that.

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:32.770
How sad. I won't be able to see Detective Oh's handsome face anymore.

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.270
- Excuse me?
- Don't you know?

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:39.170
- Didn't he tell you?
- Stop saying unnecessary things. Nothing's been decided.

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:42.700
What are you talking about? After talking to a therapist, you said you decided to work in an office.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.900
Oppa, do it if you've already decided, okay?

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.510
You'll drop dead if you keep drinking and don't sleep at night at your age.

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.800
You worked hard enough.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.600
You were a violent crime detective long enough. It's okay to stop now.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.070
Hey, it's time to open. Go and fry a chicken or something!

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:04.020
Don't call Eun Hye when you start getting busy and make her suffer.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:10.330
You're always all about Eun Hye, Eun Hye. Think about your own body.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.830
Welcome.

00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:16.250
Oppa, who do you think will have to take care of you if you get sick?

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:19.280
Eun Hye and I both will suffer.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.290
What can I get you?

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.670
- Hyeongnim.
- Shut your mouth.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.850
I take care of my own business.

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.650
Yes, this is Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Police Department.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.980
Yes.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.090
Really?

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.930
When was the incident reported?

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:46.640
And the name of the person who was in the accident is Kim Hyeong Bok, yes?

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:51.110
Then can you tell me which hospital Mr. Kim Hyeong Bok was admitted to?

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:53.910
Okay.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.850
[Ttobongee Chicken]

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.370
Who called you?

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:13.300
An insurance company. I called earlier and told them the motorcycle number.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.220
I asked them to contact me immediately when it gets in an accident.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.190
How did you know ahead of time that the motorcycle was going to get in an accident?

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.710
You heard it, too.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:28.140
...there are some people who buy them just to crash into things and get money.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.300
Insurance fraud, I see.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.620
If I recall correctly, weren't you answering your phone somewhere else at that time?

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.250
We have two ears.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.440
You're even showing off with a body part now?

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.150
Did you see the address? Kim Hyeong Bok is there, hurry up.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:52.310
Come on, what's your name? Yeong Mi? What a pretty name.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.300
Hyeong Bok, one moment.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.600
Cops?

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.100
Hyeong Bok, you, punk! Hey!

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.950
What are you doing now?

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:23.130
Hey, you bastard! Hey!

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.290
I'm going to catch you!

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:33.640
The police have issued a national manhunt and are chasing Kim Hyeong Bok, the leading suspect in the White Gown Serial Killing.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.410
Through CCTVs around the area and evidence found at the scene of the fourth serial murder,

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:43.080
the police were able to confirm that Kim Hyeong Bok is the culprit.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.320
Hyeong Bok!

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.370
Hyeong Bok!

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.760
Hey!

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.720
Hyeong Bok!

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.760
Hyeong Bok!

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.210
I'm leaving, you pigs!

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.390
Hyeong Bok,

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.790
we're not chasing you for insurance fraud. Don't be mistaken.

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:02.200
Listen to me, don't be mistaken. Listen.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.370
We're not...

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.320
We're not chasing you for insurance fraud, you idiot!

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.420
- Stop spewing nonsense, pigs!
- Hey!

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:42.990

Please let me live this once.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.850
I heard someone named Jeong Hui Joo died.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:10.210
Stop putting it on yourself.

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:13.050
It's the same thing as a detective convicting an innocent person.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.890
Burn everything so that not a single trace is left.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.830
What if the company you had a contract with sues?

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.590
Then I'll become even more of a villain.

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.760
We caught someone even the MIU couldn't catch after working three months straight.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.330
Why is this your case, you bastard? This is the victim and their family's case!

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.440
Your grandpa will join you soon.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.680
- That sound.
- You can't move no matter what.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.280
The culprit is saying, "I'm the real killer."
