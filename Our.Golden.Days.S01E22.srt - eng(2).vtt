00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.380
(Episode 22)

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300
Let me go. Please let me out.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Ji Wan.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.430
You jerk...

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.630
No!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.660
So it was you?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.100
Yeong Ra, there's a rope over there. Give it to me.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080
Ji Wan, where were you?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.310
I was terrified.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.650
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.810
You're not hurt, are you?

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.830
(Seong Jae)

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.400
All she cares about is her art.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.430
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.540
- Sure. - Ji Wan.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.570
- Mom. - Yes?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.640
(Police Station)

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.780
My goodness, that was a close call.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.750
From when he dragged Yeong Ra out to when he put her in the car,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.260
I was recording the whole thing.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.630
You can tell us the rest while we take your statement.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.330
I'm Mr. Yang Ji Il's lawyer.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.100
That must be him.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.510
- Let's go. - His lawyer is here already?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.010
Yes, I see that.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.220
Yeong Ra, are you hurt?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.320
We need to get you to a hospital. You must have passed out.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.890
No, I'm okay now, Mom.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.230
What were you doing? How could you let him harm Yeong Ra?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.500
Ji Wan knew what he was doing.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.610
Seeing that guy hanging around Yeong Ra,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.280
I was sure he'd come to the exhibition too.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.580
So I paid extra attention to the younger men, but then...

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.490
Then I smelled a familiar cologne.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.729
I smelled the same scent...

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.830
when I opened the "500th day" anniversary box he sent.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.200
It's called Ferrederick. I've used it myself.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.600
I had a bad feeling, so I went to look for him,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.840
but I'd never actually seen his face.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
But then,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.110
There was a strange guy there.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.950
He was lurking, his hat pulled down.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.190
That's when it clicked. They were in on it together.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.290
Hey, you!

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.730
Hey! Stop right there!

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.090
I faked a chase, then turned back.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.659
Then I started checking the cars in the parking lot...

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.930
that could pull out easily.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.070
(32H 9702)

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.070
He'd rented it on purpose,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.070
and I could see rope, duct tape, and scissors inside.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.710
I thought, "It must be this car."

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.280
So I was trying to figure out what to do...

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.910
when I saw Yeong Ra coming out.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.420
So to catch him red-handed, I hid and used my phone...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.720
- to start recording. - Red-handed?

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.560
Yes. If not, he would've just kept trying.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.290
The tools for the crime were already in the car,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.630
and I figured I had to wait until he got Yeong Ra in the car...

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.770
for it to count as kidnapping in the act...

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.470
Oh, my.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.370
I didn't have time to run my plan by any of you.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.740
I apologise.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.680
You came up with all that in that split second?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.020
He's right.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.219
If he'd caught him dragging her out,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.050
he'd have just made an excuse.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.260
I see now.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.090
Thank you.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.300
I'll stay here. You two should head back to the gallery.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360
Yes.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.130
We did leave in such a hurry.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.270
We need to go clean up the mess.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.870
But it worries me that his lawyer showed up way too fast.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.180
I'll look into it while they give their statements.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.950
Good.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.859
Everyone thinks Ms. Park has a lover...

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.560
and that it was some messy love affair.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.700
A messy love affair?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.499
He dragged her out by the waist.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.100
So, everyone's saying, "It's always the quiet ones..."

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.740
"you have to watch out for."

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.180
How am I going to set this straight?

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.960
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.940
Hey, Seong Jae. How's Yeong Ra?

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.910
She's in bed now.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.610
You really saved the day.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.650
Come on, I'm her bodyguard.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.120
Right. Yeong Ra's going to rest at home through tomorrow,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.320
- so you get some rest too. - Okay, got it.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.960
I wonder if Yeong Ra will keep going to her studio.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.960
Mogwang Group?

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.700
Yes.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.930
His name is Yang Ji Il, age 28. Said to be Mogwang's youngest son.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.900
And he claims he's had a crush on Yeong Ra.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.440
But the Mogwang family has 1 son, and he is in his late 40s.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.010
I'd heard rumours that Chairman Yang had a secret son.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.850
Oh, my.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.720
So that's why his lawyer showed up so fast.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.290
That punk.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.820
He ruined my daughter's reputation, and his first thought is a lawyer?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.730
What do you mean, ruined?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.830
Our Yeong Ra has been dragged into a scandal.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.200
Such a sweet, respectable girl like her.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.370
This could affect the calibre of men she can marry in the future.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.040
We're in big trouble if these rumours spread.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.110
Hello, there.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.380
Everyone's here.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.120
Mr. Lee. You never fail to impress.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.120
Your business has expanded so much already.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.260
Things just worked out that way.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.400
Hey, didn't I tell you to use the better insulation here?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.370
And I told you this should be more than enough.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.370
No, it used to be a storeroom.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.100
It got cold in here at night, even in the spring.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.110
Just drop it. It's my space anyway,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.040
and I'm the one paying for the construction.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.910
Why would you pay for it? It was all on the same estimate.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.950
That was to account for cost changes during construction.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.290
I'm tracking the exact labour and material costs as we go,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.820
so I can take my space off the final invoice.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.190
- But it's our turnkey team... - Which can be split up at any time!

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.030
Okay, fine.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.430
I got the list of turnkey projects from Mr. Jo,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.870
but why did I only get 6? The website listed 15.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.170
Are you trying to work yourself to death?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.240
From now on, I'll check the turnkey inquiries first.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.950
Didn't you read the contract? It says we vet the projects...

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.350
before handing them over to you.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.520
Let's revisit that part of the contract in three months.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.120
Does that mean you're renewing our partnership agreement?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.130
Stop playing games and go get ready. Isn't your investor meeting today?

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.530
All right. I just finished up, so I was about to go.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.770
Do a good job.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.870
What'd you say?

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.010
I said, do a good job.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.780
Right, got it. I'll do my best.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.090
No one's home?

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.160
Where did Mom and Grandma go?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.690
I was hoping for a home-cooked meal from Mom for once.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.940
Hello?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.400
Mr. Lee. It's Yeong Ra's father.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.340
Yes, sir.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.380
The first solo exhibition of up-and-coming artist, Ms. Park,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.750
was marred by a shocking incident.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.779
A stalker of over six months...

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.849
dragged the artist out and attempted to abduct her...

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.290
before being subdued and arrested by the police.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.019
The police say the suspect is Mr. Yang,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.830
a third-generation heir to a major national conglomerate.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.189
Yang threatened her with a weapon inside the gallery,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.860
holding it to her waist while pretending to be her lover...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.400
- as he dragged her out. - That's enough.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.970

(Reporter Oh Nam Su, Seongwoo Daily)

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.980
Thank you for your help, Mr. Oh.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.180
Thank you for being so generous this time.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.720
- I appreciate it. - Of course.

Yes, Ms. Jung.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.470
An article?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.240
Oh, really?

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280
I see.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.350
We've had trouble with that stalker for over six months.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.620
I'm so relieved the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.990
Yes, I'll go read the article right now.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.590

Honey, have you seen it already?

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.090
What?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.560
See what?

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.030
Honey, there's an article about yesterday's incident.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.730
Ms. Jung just called and told me.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.910
The misunderstanding about Yeong Ra having a lover is now cleared up.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.720
I invited Ji Wan over for dinner. At 7pm.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.550
You're having him over for dinner tonight?

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.160
I know we're grateful, but still...

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.030
I already invited him.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.230
All right. I'll get dinner ready.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.630
Okay.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.430
My gosh...

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240
What's going on?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.380
Eun Oh! Ji Eun Oh!

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.330
- What is it? - I did great.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.530
Great at what?

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.530
Hey, you told me to do well. I nailed the investment meeting.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600
Oh, that...

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.540
Is that all you came here to tell me?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.310
No.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.180
I came to check on the construction.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.940
Right.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.180
Then go ahead and look around.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.460
Hey.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.700
Let me get past you.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.500
Sure.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.430
I have to get to the office...

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.630
I forgot. Never mind.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.040
Bye, I'm off.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.980
Hey, did it go well?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.120
- Yes. - Good.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.420
Yes.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.300
Oh, so that's what this is about.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.510
Ten thousand dollars?

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.640
Why would my dad send me money?

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.490
He really shouldn't have. This is so awkward.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.530
Join us for dinner at my house tonight.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.800
Be at my house by 7pm.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.370
Why on earth would he invite me to his house?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.040
Is it because he's grateful for what I did yesterday?

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.370
No, that can't be it.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.280
Now that the threat is gone...

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.210
Is this the end?

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.090
I guess he's firing me.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.360
I wasn't sure what you'd like, so...

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.960
And Yeong Ra didn't know either.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.290
I'm not a picky eater.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.460
Everything looks delicious.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.530
Ji Wan.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.300
If you weren't guarding Yeong Ra, what were you planning to do?

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.570
I heard you quit the fitness center and were taking some time off.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.310
Oh, I was going to work at the in-house fitness center.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.750
Is that so?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.590
How about you put that on hold and continue to help Yeong Ra?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.730
Honey.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.200
I'll hire you directly, provide full benefits,

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.400
and even give you a 50 percent raise.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.830
Excuse me?

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.240
That stalker was released early this morning.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.140
- He's been released pending trial. - Wait, what are you talking about?

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.610
But he tried to kidnap her twice.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.580
Our lawyers said he would be tried and serve time for sure.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:50.520
For the incident at her school, there's no proof it was Yang Ji Il.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.360
He was wearing a helmet, so his face wasn't caught on the CCTV.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.090
It was him, Dad.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.100
But you're the only one who saw him.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.130
As for yesterday, we have the video from Ji Wan's phone,

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.939
and since we caught him at the scene,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.040
he can't deny that one.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.609
They argue he's not a flight risk,

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.280
and he's claiming diminished capacity.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.910
That's how they got him released without detention.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.310
So Mogwang Group must have pulled some strings.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.920
So what about us?

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.520
Are we just going to let this happen?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.020
It'll be hard to get him re-arrested.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560
Still, they can't stop him from getting prison time.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.290
And I won't let it go, even after the trial.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.160
He's not getting off with probation for these charges.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.830
Then what about Yeong Ra?

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.070
She'll have to live in fear until the trial is over.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.940
That's exactly why I'm asking you.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.580
Yeong Ra needs protection until that guy is behind bars.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.410
I understand.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.420
But just so you know, it could drag on for a while.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.320
So think it over carefully.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.470
If you're hiring me as a chauffeur, I'll have to decline.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.140
But if it's as a bodyguard, I accept.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.910
Of course. That's the main role.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.810
If you don't want to drive, I'll hire a separate chauffeur.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.050
No, I can provide better protection if I'm the one driving.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120
All right.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.390
This is...

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.990
a token of our gratitude for yesterday.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.740
I really thought I was getting fired.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.810
I wasn't expecting this.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.780
Why am I in such a good mood?

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.430
Hello?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.100
Is this Park Yeong Ra's phone?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.800
This is Lee Sang Hoon. We met at the gallery yesterday.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.100
Pardon?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.940
Right, hello.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.640
He wants to see you?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
Yes.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.010
I told him I'd check my schedule and get back to him.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.250
I knew there was something about the way he looked at you yesterday.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.520
He's quicker than I expected.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.820
But then again,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.390
there were a few others who seemed quite taken with you.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:45.960
So should I wait for the others?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.830
No, you should meet him.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.030
Lee Sang Hoon is the second son of the Jinhwa Group family.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.370
They own Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals, and he's the VP of Human Deep Bio.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.240
He'll probably be president in a few years.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.780
Honey, you sent me 2,000 dollars. What's it for?

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.480
That's the money I saved up from my part-time job.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.980
But why are you giving it to me?

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.650
Who else would I give it to?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.590
And you don't have to send me an allowance anymore.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.020
I won't need tuition money either. I'll keep working my part-time job,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.830
so I can pay my own way.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.169
I just registered for the practical exam.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.600
It's in November.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.700
He sounds so confident he's going to pass.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.640
I'll pass it, no matter what.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.540
You're working so hard.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.110
Never mind.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.080
You're Lee Sang Cheol, so you can do this.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.490
And don't worry even if you fail the exam.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.620
There's no rule that says only you can get a part-time job, right?

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.460
Listen to you, talking nonsense.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.660
After all the trouble with my father after Ji Hyuk was born,

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.470
you think I'd make you work now? There's no way I'd ever do that.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.040
By the way, I sent the money to Ji Hyuk.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.340
Under your name.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.010
Why would you send it in my name? You think he'd take money from me?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.950
And do you think he'd believe that I had that much money to send him?

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.120
Besides, it carries more weight coming from you.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.450
Mom! Dad! Grandma!

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.360
Goodness, what's all that racket? What's going on?

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.260
Ta-da! This is a gift for my worn-out dad.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.470
- I got this for you. - What? What's the occasion?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.869
You need to take care of your health.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.300
And you ladies are hard to shop for,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.310
so I got you cash. Here, this is for you, Mom.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.710
- And Grandma. - Oh, my. What's gotten into you?

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.150
I'm an official bodyguard now.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.620
I'm getting full benefits and a 50 percent raise.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.650
Hey, hold on. What are you talking about?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.690
Here, Dad.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:54.760
Go on, try it.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.490
- Here. - Okay.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.860
Wow, would you look at this? Our youngest got this for my health.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.740
You were jealous Ji Hyuk gave gifts for me and his grandmother.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.370
Hey, this is pretty good.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.080
They're easy to take, so grab one whenever you go out, Dad.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.150
But Ji Wan, isn't it a long time until the trial?

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.920
Will this really help your career?

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.320
After the trial, I'll be in charge of the employee gym.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.920
As a full-time employee, no less.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.060
I thought he was just goofing off, but he's actually been doing great.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.260
Our Ji Wan sure got lucky. All thanks to Seong Jae.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.770
Come on, it wasn't because of Seong Jae.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.340
Do you have any idea what the people who run that company are like?

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.440
You think they'd reward him so well just for catching a stalker?

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.410
He laid a trap to catch the stalker, to catch him in the act.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.480
That's what they recognised. He went above and beyond.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.190
That's right, Dad.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.790
See?

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.590
(Gaon Foundation)

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.830
I'm meeting Lee Sang Hoon the day after tomorrow.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.170
Yeong Ra is one thing,

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.570
but I need to deal with Woo Jin.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.280
Can I really get a liver transplant?

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.850
When?

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.480
Ji Eun Oh is a suitable match for the liver transplant.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.520
That is, if Ji Eun Oh gives her consent.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.530
You...

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.170
What am I going to do with you?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.870
Han Yu Ra.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.080
Patrol's clear.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.750
So what did you bring me today?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.760
How far did you get on your webtoon? You made a lot of progress.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.160
I pulled an all-nighter.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.130
- Aren't you sleepy? - Not yet.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.700
I plan to finish drawing everything I've plotted before I leave today.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.870
I had an idea while I was on patrol. What if Dokgo Chan and Ko So Ri...

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.670
had a run-in before the zombie incident?

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.310
They bumped into each other while cooking ramyeon by the Han River.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040
Ramyeon by the Han River?

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.620
I've seen people do that,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.050
but I don't really know what it's all about.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.190
Do you want to go check it out for research? To the Han River?

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.090
What? Yes! Let's do it! I'd love that!

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.360
But you have to be at the gallery tomorrow,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.730
so let's go the day after tomorrow.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.870
I have plans the day after tomorrow.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.300
You do? Who are you meeting?

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.810
Someone from my show contacted me, and my mom wants me to meet him.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.280
And you? I guess you're interested in him too.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.050
He made a good impression, and he exceeds my mom's standards.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.620
What if you meet him, he proposes, and your mom tells you to marry him?

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.820
Would you actually get married?

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.890
I guess I'd have to, right?

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.600
For all the spinning the world does, you always end up in the same spot.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.670
(Title: My Garden, Summer)

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.680
(Title: Chicory and Siler Flowers Under the Plum Tree)

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.490
These are great.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.360
Hey, Yeong Ra. I haven't seen these two before.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.430
When did you paint them?

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.130
Those?

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.770
Those are some of my earliest works I had tucked away.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.770
Ms. Jang is my assistant.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.140
All artists have assistants.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.150
So that's how she became an artist. That's what it took to become one.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.750
What do you mean?

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.220
It's nothing. Never mind.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.870
We can expand this and put the conference table here.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.210
We'll use it as a meeting room, but when it's free,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.009
the staff can use it as a workspace and meet with clients here too.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.910
The multi-use plan should work, right?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.280
For quiet meetings, we can use the turnkey team's conference room.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.280
My office gets bigger too. I like it.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.650
It was a great idea.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.690
Ms. Yang, what brings you here?

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.700
I'm on the Sinchon-dong project, and I went to meet Mr. Jo,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.260
but then I heard you were here on site.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.600
And?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.300
Since this will be the new office, I'll be coming and going a lot,

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.110
so I came to have a look around.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.150
I know that look in her eyes.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.780
Is that really what you wear to a business meeting?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.060
This is our new designer. And this is Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.730
You heard we've got a turnkey team lead, right?

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.760
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.170
I'm Yang So Mi.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.670
Right.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.740
Time to prepare lunch.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.140
- Prepare lunch. - Just a second.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.180
- Time to prepare... - Oh, it really is almost lunchtime.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.820
Why don't you have lunch with me? It's my treat.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.350
I'm having lunch with Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.719
Then Ms. Ji can come too. I can treat you both.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.930
Ms. Ji isn't comfortable being treated by just anyone.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.600
Watch your step on your way out.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.040
Goodbye, then.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.850
She's clearly interested in you. Why were you so harsh?

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.090
As I recall, she used to be exactly your type.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.520
Not anymore.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.560
Why not?

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.260
Because now...

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.200
I like you.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.540
Eun Oh, I like you so much.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.100
So much.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.580
You're serious?

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.610
Ji Hyuk?

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880
What?

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.490
Oh, well...

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.220
Eun Oh.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.290
I'm going to try and win her over. At the company,

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.599
I'm going to make myself completely indispensable.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.900
And then,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.130
I'm going to tell Eun Oh how I feel.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.500
Lee Ji Hyuk, you crazy fool.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.540
What did you say?

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.410
What?

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.210
It's nothing.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.410
Let's go grab lunch.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.750
I have to eat with the carpenters. I promised I'd buy.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.020
Then what about me?

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960
Thanks.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.970
- Enjoy your meal! - Enjoy your meal!

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.370
It tastes better since I'm crashing it.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.280
Yes, Director Ko.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.850
Oh, dear. I misdialled.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.190
Sorry about that.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.090
No problem.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.660
I'll let you get back to work.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.730
Actually, wait.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.490
Since I have you on the phone, I might as well tell you now.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.260
It's about the leak.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.130
Okay. I was actually wondering about that.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.600
We had the building inspected for the leak,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.110
and it looks like we'll need to do some major work.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.710
So our schedule might get pushed back.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.810
I see.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.450
But Director Ko...

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.320
You don't sound so good.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.760
It's nothing.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520
I'll let you go.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.290
Okay.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.670
I wonder if she's sick.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.840
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.910
- Here's the extra meat you ordered. - Wow, this batch looks great too.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.850
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.750
Hey, order more! Keep it coming!

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.520
Go wild on that kiosk. Go on.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.350
The more you order, the better the deal is here.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.490
That's right! After your promotion and winning that housing lottery.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.260
What's a dinner bill like this to you now?

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.260
Right. I'm a senior manager now, not just a manager anymore.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.430
- Senior Manager. - Yes?

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.170
Then can I order some pork too?

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.800
Yes, go for it! You guys over there, order more too.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.440
Your table, our table. Everyone, order more! Come on.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.810
Gang Oh. More meat for table four.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.440
Hello...

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.449
Wow, Mom was totally right.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.610
She said you were a whole new person.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.310
Are you Mr. Ji Gang Oh, by any chance?

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.950
Do you have a death wish?

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.650
What are you doing here?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.030
I wanted to see how he was doing and go home together for a change.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.430
- Just wait a minute. - Okay.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.060
Are the dishes piling up?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.860
No, Gang Oh, you take a break.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.170
I'll do the dishes.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Don't worry about it.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.640
Hey, have you eaten?

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:11.910
Do you want me to get you something?

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.740
Can I just get a glass of water?

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280
You got it.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.950
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.060
Hello, Director Ko?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320
Is this Ji Eun Oh?

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.590
Do you happen to know the owner of this phone?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.460
Yes, I do. Why?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.900
I'm calling from a bar called Icarus in Cheongmyeong-dong.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.100
We think you need to come and pick her up.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.370
We're calling because you were the last number in her call history.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240
What?

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.410
Hi, you called me? I'm here.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.780
Right...

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.949
We tried calling a designated driver,

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.080
but she strongly refused.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.590
I see.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.960
Director Ko, are you okay?

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.700
And who might this be?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.910
You look like... Ji Eun Oh.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.250
Yes, it's me.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.350
What are you doing here, Eun Oh?

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.320
We didn't have plans to meet today.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.750
It's getting really late.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.890
Don't you think you should go home?

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.160
- I'll take you home. - You want me to go where?

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.760
Go home?

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.570
Yes.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.600
I think you should go home and get some rest.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.510
Rest?

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.880
Me?

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.980
Me?

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.550
When I don't even know where she's lying,

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.290
you expect me to go lie down in a warm bed?

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.290
I...

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.330
I lost a daughter.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.160
No one knows about her.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.730
No one but me.

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:23.540
I don't even know what cold ground that poor child is lying in,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.140
or where she even died.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.710
"Died?" What do you mean?

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.250
No, maybe she's not dead.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.550
Maybe someone took her.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.090
No...

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.260
She's dead.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.400
The neighbour she was with and her daughter died in it too.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.500
So how could she have survived that fire?

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.470
Director Ko.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.510
I had just given birth to twins.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.410
On the way to their first birthday, my husband died in a hit-and-run.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.320
Overnight, I was thrown out on the street.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.720
I had to leave one of my twins with my neighbour...

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.930
and carried the other on my back while I sold insurance door-to-door.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.830
A fire broke out at the Busan Market where she'd taken my daughter.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.399
The fire spread to the next building,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.740
which also collapsed.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.810
They never even found her body.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.680
And just like that, she was gone.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.450
My poor baby.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.750
It was so tragic.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.490
But you know, Eun Oh...

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.160
Do you have any idea how shameless I am?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.670
I got married again, just to save myself.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.340
My husband doesn't even know I had a daughter.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.540
I never told him.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.980
It wasn't because I was afraid of losing him.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.460
To even say her name felt like it would tear my mouth apart,

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.890
but keeping it inside felt like my heart would tear in two.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.360
As I went on with my life,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.700
I swore I would never speak of her again.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.070
I swore I wouldn't even think of her.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.740
But today... I saw her.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.810
What?

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:48.980
It was on this very day in 1997...

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.890
that I lost her.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.590
I go to a temple every year on this day,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.130
and for some reason, one of the nuns looked just like her.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.000
I ran after her. I grabbed her and asked.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.230
It wasn't her.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.540
It wasn't her.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.610
The very thought of it is agonizing.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.750
And I have no one to share this with.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.790
Missing someone so much it drives you crazy...

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.290
Do you have any idea what that's like?

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.500
Director Ko...

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.940
What am I supposed to do?

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.110
What is wrong with me today?

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.950
Eun Oh, you really drew the short straw.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.220
Ever since I told you about my daughter,

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.820
she's been appearing in my dreams.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.200
My daughter... She loved bananas more than anything.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.370
Losing my daughter tore my heart to pieces,

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.980
and now my son's suffering is ripping me apart.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.710
- Could you set the GPS to "Home?" - Okay.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.640
What? You look like Ji Eun Oh.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.220
Yes, that's the one. Please take us there.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.900
I shouldn't have let her take me home.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.940
No, this wasn't supposed to happen.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.310
She doesn't know this neighbourhood at all.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.550
There's no way she could've memorized the address.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.470
This is so sad.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.640
My heart aches.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:10.050
Wearing this retro style makes me feel like a whole new person.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.220
It gives me a fresh new look, you know?

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.420
You should all try it too. It feels like you're someone else.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.700
I got this dress for 17.50 dollars.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.830
(SUTANDARD)

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.570
Nice.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.700
She should've done this sooner.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.210
(SUTANDARD)

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.270
I saw it too.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.340
Ha Eun! What is going on?

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.180
I even got a few more subscribers.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.010
Have you seen the comments?

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.320
Everyone's going wild over how lovely and cute you are.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.690
I know, right? It's so wild, I can hardly believe it.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.660
We have a bit of an age gap, don't we?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.930
I hear you're 25,

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.770
and I'm 35.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.640
My mom said I should meet you if I had a good first impression.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.570
So, did I make a good first impression?

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.140
Yes.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:10.810
You gave me your business card to tell me who you were.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.610
To be honest, it was your mother who encouraged me,

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.180
but when I saw you, Yeong Ra, I was glad I came.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.290
And I really enjoyed your paintings.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.360
Oh, that's right. You must've been shocked that day.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.960
If only I'd realised what was happening sooner that day,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.500
I could have helped you, Yeong Ra.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.970
There was no way you could have known.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.800
You don't have another guy like that, do you?

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040
No, of course not.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.610
I lead a pretty quiet life.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.910
It seems you just focus on your art and haven't dated much.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.580
I like that.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.050
What's to like about that?

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.160
Business is so slow, my wife and I have decided to run the store alone.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.590
I see. Well, you have to do what you have to do.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.000
So we'll only need you to work until 4pm today.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.300
We'll make sure you're paid for your time up to today.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:05.970
Wait, today?

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:09.040
We just made the final decision last night.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.300
I'm very sorry.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.910
Well, I'll be back at 4pm, then.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.350
My gosh.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:20.850
Oh, come on!

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.550
I get it, but still. To fire me on the spot like that.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.900
Oh, boy. This place was perfect for me.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.600
(Job Postings, Recommended Part-time Jobs)

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.970
You fool.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.470
You're a fool for seeking a store that's a perfect fit.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.150
Hey, Yeong Bo.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.150
Yes.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.820
So, have you decided on the investment?

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.420
And you sent the term sheet?

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.690
Okay, then let's meet to iron out the details.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.530
Okay. Yes, I'll be in touch then.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.830
Great, thank you. Okay.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.040
Mr. Lee, which firm is it?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.540
Lumina Ventures.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.250
What are you doing here all alone?

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.950
Ji Eun Oh!

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.989
Ji Eun Oh! Hey.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.430
- What? - Why are you the one sanding?

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.060
The carpenters did the 1st pass. I'm just doing the 2nd and 3rd.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.970
Right, but why are you doing it? We can just call the spackling team.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.840
It's just a small job. Why pay their day rate?

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.540
Why are you worried about the cost?

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.340
Are you the designer or the hired help?

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.580
This is nothing new for me.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.810
It's just how I work.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:59.850
Where's the sandpaper?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.350
- Found it. - No, I can do it.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.990
I can't just let you do this alone.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.690
Let's finish quickly so we can eat. And I'm starving.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.960
Don't you dare ask me to pay you. I never asked for your help.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.660
You don't have to pay me.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.560
I'll take the top part.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:21.640
I'm not doing the final spackling, though.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.570
Okay!

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:56.570
Yes.

That's great! Congratulations!

Man, I'm starving. My gosh.

Let's eat.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.020
I brought some sandwiches.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.620
Then I'm doing the bathroom tiles exactly how I want.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.530
I told you to do it your way.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.330
So how much is left to do?

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.470
We have the wallpapering, the finishing film,

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.870
and then moving in the furniture.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.910
Look how far you've come, Ji Eun Oh.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.880
When we first renovated this cafe,

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.710
I could've sworn you didn't have feet.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.310
The way you were always darting around,

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.550
without ever resting.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.020
Did that project take about two months?

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:47.390
Three months.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.960
Thanks to Hyeon Su, we didn't have a deadline,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.660
so we did a ton of trial and error and built it exactly how we wanted.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.369
This is driving me crazy.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:06.310
This isn't bad. Why did you throw it out?

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.180
I bet you'd do great with these.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.810
Ji Hyuk.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.650
You'll do great.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.820
Oh, right...

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.130
How long was I asleep?

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040
I was out for an hour.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.180
Oh, has it been that long already?

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.450
Why did you let me sleep on your shoulder for a whole hour?

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.080
Why me?

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.520
You were in pain,

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.590
and you hadn't been able to sleep.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.900
You know me. I'm practically an angel of mercy.

There's nothing else?

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240
There is, for me.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.620
I'm in trouble.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.200
It's getting really late.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.530
I'm supposed to discuss business at home tonight.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.340
Okay, sure.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.270
Let's go home.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.610
I still have some things to wrap up.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.420
All right.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.380
I'll get going, then.

Go check on her.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.619
I have pants just like these.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.850
- Look. - What?

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.850
Oh, dear. Where did I put them?

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.990
Yes. See?

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.060
A perfect match, right?

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.630
- They're practically identical. - See? I told you.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.700
No way.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.700
- This is amazing, Grandma. - That's my style.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.070
What? They're exactly the same.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.240
Work as an apartment security guard?

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.450
My friend's the building manager, and he's looking to hire someone.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:21.880
He'd prefer to give the job to someone he knows.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320
Hey, you know...

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:27.450
- I'm studying for my license. - Of course, I know.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.560
Yeong Bo told me you even passed the written test.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.059
But passing the practical exam and getting the license...

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.800
doesn't guarantee you a job in the field.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.100
Hey. Did you really tell me it was urgent...

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.940
just so I'd have to come and hear this?

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.900
I told him not to bring it up.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.440
But he started talking about your wife.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.410
Just think how worried your wife must be.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.010
I know skilled trade jobs are stable,

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.120
but it's tough at our age.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.520
They mostly hire guys in their 40s and 50s.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.350
Hey. Men over 60 can work control rooms...

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.860
or mechanical rooms.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.060
Look, people live to be 80 or older these days.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.629
I refuse to live in constant anxiety,

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.100
working year-long contracts.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.969
I'm going to get a proper job with insurance,

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.930
so I'm not a burden on my kids.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.640
You think anyone lives like this because they want to?

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.540
Life doesn't always go as planned.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.710
Why do you keep saying I can't? I'm going to do it.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.450
Goodness, you're so stubborn.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.990
You're refusing to face reality. It's because of your son, isn't it?

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.290
- What? - You lost face over Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.259
Your son tried to seduce a rich girl and marry her,

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.600
but it fell through. How embarrassing.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.570
Hey! My son isn't like that.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.870
She was the one who proposed to him.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.540
Either way, the fact is he ended up blaming his own circumstances.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:56.479
That's why you're scrambling.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.680
You don't want him seeing you that way.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.480
- Hey, that's enough. Stop it! - No, he's right.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.150
I don't want to be seen as that kind of father.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:10.390
A father with just a mortgaged house and a job that could end tomorrow.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.130
That's right. I refuse to be the kind of father...

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:14.860
my children have to worry about.

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:16.730
I'm going to keep trying until I make it.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:20.070
Don't you guys know how fit I am?

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.440
I'd run a half-marathon every year without even breaking a sweat.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:28.670
At a warehouse or construction site, I'll do anything to support my wife.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.240
- Mind your own business. - All right, fine.

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.480
I'm just looking out for you.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:39.250
Where are you going?

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.120
What is wrong with me?

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.150
I don't want to be seen as that kind of father.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.390
At a warehouse or construction site, I'll do anything to support my wife.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.760
Mind your own business.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.200
Father! What are you doing here?

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.340
You... What are you doing?

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.240
You can't just drink straight from the bottle like that.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:40.610
Did something happen?

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.840
- You don't need to know. - Get up. I'll drink with you.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.380
What do you think you're doing?

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.980
There's something I need to say too.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.020
You said you had something to say.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.520
Well, go on.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.960
You first. Tell me why you were about to drink so heavily.

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:03.100
You're the one who dragged me here saying you had something to say.

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.400
I don't know where your head's at.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.270
So I'm not sure if I want to bring it up now.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.700
What is it?

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.940
Well, I don't feel like telling you either.

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:15.610
I don't even want to talk about it.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:26.320
Fine. Then I'll just get straight to the point.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.720
That 10,000 dollars you sent me.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.690
I transferred it back into your account.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.190
- I... - So, that's...

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.930
all this was about? Returning the money?

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.760
Without even asking why I sent it?

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:39.270
What about you?

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.900
You sent it without even asking if I needed it.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.740
You just made your own assumptions.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.310
Well, what else can I do but assume? You don't tell me anything.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:50.140
What was I supposed to say? You never even ask.

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.080
About how my business is doing, what my situation is...

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.180
Am I supposed to tell you every single little detail?

00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:00.290
- Is that our relationship now? - Did I make it this way?

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.020
You did.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.730
Right. I'm the one who did it.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:08.589
I was to marry Haneul Construction's daughter,

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.230
but the wedding was called off.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.400
You can't even find a job, but you won't take the money I send.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.370
If you turn around and send money, do you really expect me to take it?

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:20.810
"He must be struggling somewhere again."

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.880
That's what you thought, right?

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.940
Are you...

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.750
giving me a hard time just because you think I'm still mad at you?

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:30.620
And how could I not be angry?

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.750
Do you have any idea what you did? What you put us through?

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.720
This again?

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:39.830
That I humiliated you and Mom and never begged for forgiveness.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:41.860
Is that what makes you so angry?

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:43.400
"Angry?"

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.500
You think that's all I am? Angry?

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:49.540
You trampled all over my 33-year career, you punk!

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900
The moment you...

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.510
decided to go through with that marriage...

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.380
Look.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.050
Just after your first birthday, your grandpa had a boat accident.

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.430
He broke ribs and damaged his lungs. He could never go back on the boat.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.930
Out of despair, he drank his days away.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:20.970
He had pleurisy, a brain haemorrhage, an aneurysm, and even kidney cancer.

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:24.640
He spent 30 years going to hospitals before he finally passed away.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:27.540
Was that my fault?

00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:31.140
Was I to blame? It was hard for me too, you know?

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.880
But I couldn't change the situation, so I just did the best I could.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.120
As the head of this family, as a father.

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.750
I was always terrified of being laid off.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:44.620
So I worked harder and harder. I became their model employee.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.760
That's how I managed to hold on until retirement.

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160
But...

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.270
you turned your back on everything I am.

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:56.900
You made me feel like my whole life was for nothing, you punk.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.410
The life I lived as a provider, a father, and a son...

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.340
You completely trampled all over it, you little punk!

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.180
You were trying to marry her for money?

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.419
How could you make such a foolish choice?

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.750
And after creating such a mess,

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.350
you ran away and moved back in. Have you ever apologised to me?

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520
And what about you?

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:19.230
Have you ever apologised to me?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.990
Have you ever said you were sorry?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
What?

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.830
- For not sending you to the US? - Yes.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.400
I trusted your promise, so from tenth grade,

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:33.640
I spent two years of my life preparing to study abroad.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.380
While my friends studied for college, I studied English,

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.010
took sketching classes,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.710
and studied architectural design.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:41.710
I was a high school senior...

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.550
when you told me, "I can't send you abroad."

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.620
"The money we saved up..."

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.020
"is all going to your grandpa's medical bills."

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.630
My dream of becoming an architect overseas...

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.630
and the two years I spent working toward that dream...

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.860
were crushed with a single sentence from you.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.670
Do you have any idea how I felt back then?

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.670
But my hands were tied in that situation!

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.440
- Grandpa's life was on the line... - Not once...

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.810
did you say you were sorry.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.480
"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Ji Hyuk."

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.680
"I'm sorry for putting you through this."

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:20.850
Those simple words...

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:23.560
You never said them.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.020
Not even once.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.390
Do I have to say the words out loud to be sorry?

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.430
As your father, do you think I didn't feel terrible?

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:32.630
And what about my marriage?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.940
You just went straight to blaming me.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.340
Like I was some kind of trash who sold myself for money.

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:41.240
You never even asked why I made that choice.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.840
You just judged me based on your own assumptions,

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.210
condemned me, and did nothing but criticize me.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.950
Not once have you ever made an effort to understand me.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.420
Even though you worked hard your whole life,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.890
your child can still hate it. It's not about right or wrong.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.390
I'm saying that as your son, I'm allowed to hate it.

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:04.300
Why must I tell you you were right and did the right thing?

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.100
Especially when I'm telling you how hard it was for me.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.970
I love you and Mom, but...

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.840
I'm telling you, I'm allowed to hate the way I grew up.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.710
But just because I feel that way,

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.780
why does that make me the bad guy?

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.050
I...

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.380
haven't done anything wrong to you.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.760
You ungrateful little brat...

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.770
You really never change, do you?

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:56.650
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk.

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:00.590
You...

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.260
Why don't you just move out?

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.600
Are you serious?

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.740
So that's what you really want?

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.670
Is that it?

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.650
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:05.780
You started an investment firm? Did you think we wouldn't find out?

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:07.220
What were you thinking, doing this behind my back?

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:11.620
Why the long face, honey? Got something to hide?

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:14.760
You're curious, aren't you? About how I was adopted.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:16.660
I guess this is what they call perfect timing.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.329
Eun Oh is wavering over Ji Hyuk again.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.100
How did I not see that coming?

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.940
You've all been curious, haven't you? About my business.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.670
Let's be strangers in the house. Let's just ignore each other.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.840
Fine.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.780
For the sake of peace in the family.
