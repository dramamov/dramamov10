00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.976
Hello?

00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:23.559
The lawyer wanted more pictures of the scene.

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:27.232
I'll submit a request for an arrest warrant when I get back.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:28.632
Okay.

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:38.207
Did you remember?

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:39.972
You wanted this.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.488
You told me to kill you with my own hands if I wanted you dead.

00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.758
How dare you try to put me in prison?

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.224
No.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:01.956
I'm not going there.

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.411
Do you think I'll go to prison after killing you?

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.536
I'm not going.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:09.327
They won't find any evidence this time either.

00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:13.507
You'll die like your father did.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.145
Why?

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:19.067
Because the person who killed you also won't ever get caught.

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.397
You shouldn't have looked down on me.

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:25.028
You were just a nobody mooching off my family. How dare you look down on me!

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:27.719
How dare you!

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:09.311
My father told me this right before he died.

00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:13.194
He said kicking you out was the most regrettable thing he ever did.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.878
He said he doesn't consider someone like me as his son.

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:23.089
I'm his actual son. So why?

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:30.496
Why did I have to be treated like that because of a piece of trash like you?

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.021
Die, you bastard!

00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:26.371
Die!

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.690
Get out of my life!

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:09.382
Die!

00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.405
Don't ever mess with a detective.

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:50.195
You could die.

00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.689
I'm dying right now. Please send help.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.127
I'm at the abandoned apartment building in Gahyundong, Incheon.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.386
You can't die yet.

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:19.118
You have to pay for what you did first.

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.667
Hello?

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:30.153
Who?

00:06:30.153 --> 00:06:31.761
Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.390
Yes, he's a detective in our team.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.412
What's this about?

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:40.270
Yes, he has bled a lot.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.401
Yes.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.259
Thankfully, he's still breathing.

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:47.682
Do Chang, where are you going?

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.678
Did you operate on Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:08.764
No, it wasn't me.

00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:12.653
Then do you know anything about how his surgery is going?

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:15.767
Please wait. The surgeon will talk to you once the surgery is done.

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:17.291
Okay.

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:34.113
Do Chang!

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:36.284
How did it go?

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:38.542
He's still in surgery.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:41.750
- How is he?
- It's not life-threatening.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.105
Thank goodness! I'm really relieved.

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:47.140
Did you guys find out where that bastard Oh Jong Tae is?

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.056
You see... It's a little...

00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:52.694
He followed Detective Oh and stabbed him. I'm sure of it.

00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.974
We need to arrest him right away.

00:07:56.468 --> 00:07:58.867
Go and arrest him before he gets away!

00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:01.217
Oh Jong Tae is in the hospital too.

00:08:01.217 --> 00:08:04.459
- He also got stabbed like Detective Oh.
- What?

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.040
The paramedics rescued him from Park Geon Ho's murder site,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.375
and his injuries are also not life-threatening.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.991
It looks like they fought each other with a knife.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.138
What did the doctor say?

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:43.038
He said he's in shock because he lost a lot of blood.

00:08:43.038 --> 00:08:47.281
He said the surgery went well, so we don't need to worry.

00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.027
Have you contacted his family?

00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:51.877
He doesn't have any family.

00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:57.536
I don't think everyone needs to be here. You guys can go.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.583
I'll call you when he wakes up.

00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:05.954
He acted so tough, but in the end he was a lonely guy.

00:09:05.954 --> 00:09:09.189
He has a lot of money from his inheritance, though. There's no need to worry about him.

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:11.536
Hey! What's the point of having a lot of money

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:13.823
when you don't have family to take care of you at times like this?

00:09:13.823 --> 00:09:15.681
What do you mean, he doesn't have any family?

00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:16.852
We're his family.

00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:18.998
Family, my ass.

00:09:18.998 --> 00:09:24.044
Hey, do you think these guys would worry about me if the same thing happened to me?

00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:26.034
Probably, they'll first think about the money I owe them.

00:09:26.034 --> 00:09:28.659
Wait. Jae Hong Hyeong.

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:31.469
Why haven't you paid back the money I chipped in for you during our last bet?

00:09:31.469 --> 00:09:34.279
Come on. A family doesn't get hung up on a few dollars.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:36.289
They just forget about it.

00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:40.058
Oh, so we're only family when it comes to money?

00:09:40.058 --> 00:09:44.562
You've grown so much. Look at you talking back to me now.

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:48.437
Hey. Let's figure out who'll take over Do Chang's place tomorrow.

00:09:48.437 --> 00:09:50.161
- Who wants to come first?
- Me!

My goodness.

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.153
You just don't want to work!

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:54.985
Come on.

00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.633
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Scissors.

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:58.068
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Yeah.

00:09:58.068 --> 00:09:59.799
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:13.390
You should've studied a bit more and become a prosecutor.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.037
That's not the face of a detective.

00:10:18.037 --> 00:10:20.876
You got even paler.

00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:24.206
You should go and get married once this is over.

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:26.686
You should get yourself a family first.

00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:31.953
Well, I should be more worried about myself.

00:10:31.953 --> 00:10:33.770
Damn.

00:10:45.822 --> 00:10:50.301
I'm Go Gyeong Ho, the director of Incheon police's Auditing Department.

00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:55.768
I'll start the briefing now.

00:10:55.768 --> 00:10:58.830
The recording that was recently reported by a newspaper

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.805
followed the current laws for auditing protocol.

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:05.259
And I would like to express that the newspaper

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:07.730
edited the recording to distort the content.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.557
Then please confirm what's correct or reveal the entire recording.

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:13.088
Please understand that we cannot reveal the recording

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:16.055
because it's part of an ongoing investigation.

00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:20.080
But we plan to have the auditor in charge of the investigation

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.590
take responsibility for leaking the content of an ongoing investigation.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:30.978
We regret that this information leak has caused unrest for the public.

00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:34.572
We plan to follow protocol and use press arbitration to handle the press

00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:38.026
that reported on the issue as well as any future reports regarding this issue.

00:11:38.026 --> 00:11:40.907
When will you release information about the investigation?

00:12:02.134 --> 00:12:03.656
What? Is there a problem?

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:06.616
Why do I have to take responsibility for that?

00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:09.743
Don't worry. I'm not going to let you take all the blame.

00:12:09.743 --> 00:12:12.687
I clearly told you that I didn't know anything about it.

00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:14.728
But you did meet with Jin Seo Kyeong.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:17.552
What does that have to do with this?

00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:20.601
I just met her once very briefly.

00:12:20.601 --> 00:12:22.204
We didn't talk about anything.

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:23.921
We're conducting a separate investigation on that.

00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:27.068
You'll hear about it once we find out the truth.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.574
The content of the recording is not good.

00:12:31.574 --> 00:12:36.074
So you're trying to focus on the leak instead of the content, right?

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:41.646
You're trying to bury everything by sacrificing me!

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:47.191
You should just accept it.

00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:50.405
It's a narrow path to get to the top.

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:54.829
If you try to stay here, that path will only get narrower for you.

00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:03.243
What? Rejected?

00:13:03.243 --> 00:13:05.029
Damn it.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.825
And why?

00:13:07.415 --> 00:13:09.174
Lack of motive?

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:12.769
Damn, those bastards.

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:17.999
Hey. You're awake.

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.493
You should stay down!

00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:22.946
The wound will open up if you move around!

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:23.846
I'm fine.

00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:26.068
You almost died. You're not fine.

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:28.101
I'm really okay.

00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:32.012
I'm a little sore, but other than that I'm fine.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.085
What happened?

00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:38.767
Did Oh Jong Tae stab you?

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:40.267
Yes.

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.890
But it's okay.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.028
I stabbed him too.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.537
Are you saying you guys are even because you stabbed each other?

00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:50.395
Jong Tae stabbed me first, so there won't be an issue.

00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:51.396
Don't worry.

00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:53.088
Just go live in the jungles then!

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:55.883
If someone stabs you, you can stab them back!

00:13:55.883 --> 00:13:57.080
Why are you living here?

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.037
And as my partner at that?

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:01.728
You crazy bastard.

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:08.087
Did you request Oh Jong Tae's arrest warrant?

00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:09.327
I did.

00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:12.161
I got Jae Hong to do it last night,

00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:15.437
but the prosecutor rejected it this morning.

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:19.365
He dismissed it even after Jo Seong Dae's confession?

00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:23.111
There must be someone helping him like you said. This wouldn't make sense otherwise.

00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:25.285
It's Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:27.110
That's the only possible explanation.

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:28.834
Yoo Jeong Seok?

00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:32.052
Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:33.518
I got a call from the district office.

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:35.602
I might have to go to the Press Arbitration Board.

00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:38.480
They're taking it seriously. Let's talk more if we have to go to the Board.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.513
I don't care about that,

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:43.447
but they're only focusing on the source of the leakage instead of the truth.

00:14:43.447 --> 00:14:45.035
Are we not going to do anything about that?

00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:48.361
Isn't it natural for someone to take responsibility for it after our article?

00:14:48.361 --> 00:14:51.152
I think they're just doing their job.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:56.593
I'm Detective Kang Do Chang from Incheon's West Police Department's Violent Crimes Unit.

00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:13.128
So you admit that you met Oh Jong Tae, right?

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:15.790
A request for Oh Jong Tae's arrest warrant got rejected.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.672
His accomplice confessed to the crime,

00:15:17.672 --> 00:15:21.132
and he can even be charged with attempted murder for trying to silence the accomplice.

00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:24.838
And yet, the request for his arrest warrant got rejected for a silly reason.

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:27.239
That's up to the prosecution.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.266
The press can't do anything about it, even if it's unfair.

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.805
Oh Jong Tae is a murderer.

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:34.429
Why are you protecting him?

00:15:36.212 --> 00:15:38.975
I think you've just made a mistake by saying that.

00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:41.785
You're the one who is making a mistake.

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:44.732
He's going to continue killing people

00:15:44.732 --> 00:15:47.242
and you're helping him.

00:15:47.242 --> 00:15:48.633
Detective Kang.

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:50.386
How can you say that?

00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:51.651
On what grounds are you─

00:15:51.675 --> 00:15:56.016
My partner is in the hospital right now after being stabbed by him.

00:15:56.016 --> 00:16:02.116
Oh Jong Tae is trying to kill whoever it takes to hide what he did.

00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:05.689
I believe you made a mistake because you didn't know who he really is.

00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:07.209
It's not too late.

00:16:07.209 --> 00:16:09.166
I'm not asking for you to help me.

00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:16.155
I'm just asking for you to leave it alone, so he'll receive a fair judgment by the law.

00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:18.438
You're saying Detective Oh got stabbed?

00:16:18.438 --> 00:16:20.328
Thankfully, he's still alive.

00:16:20.328 --> 00:16:24.099
But he will try to kill Oh Ji Hyeok again at some point,

00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:29.918
because he'll think he won't get punished for killing someone.

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:42.278
Listen. Do you think I'm some kind of joke?

00:16:42.278 --> 00:16:46.333
You're free to believe whatever you want,

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:49.904
but the moment you voice your beliefs,

00:16:50.665 --> 00:16:52.844
you must take responsibility for them.

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:54.654
I'm...

00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.941
not that educated.

00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:02.024
So I'm not good with words when I'm in front of an educated man.

00:17:02.024 --> 00:17:06.147
But all I want is just one thing.

00:17:06.147 --> 00:17:08.204
Let me catch the killer.

00:17:08.204 --> 00:17:12.946
Is it so wrong for a detective to ask you to let him catch a murderer?

00:17:12.946 --> 00:17:14.872
Jin Seo Kyeong!

00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:17.244
Why are you letting anyone come in here?

00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:23.220
Why are you letting people like him come here and spew nonsense at me?

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:30.382
Senior Manager.

00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:40.919
I'll take this as proof of the police's illegal investigation of the press.

00:17:49.987 --> 00:17:52.425
Wow, that bastard.

00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:54.883
Where is Detective Oh right now?

00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:56.886
It's not a big deal.

00:17:56.886 --> 00:18:00.033
I got into a little accident while arguing with my cousin.

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.844
There shouldn't be any problem since we both assaulted each other.

00:18:02.844 --> 00:18:04.881
I apologize for worrying you.

00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:07.783
I'll keep this short since you're in the hospital.

00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:10.316
You better don't let me have this type of meeting again.

00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:12.406
I'm really sorry about that.

00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:17.273
I'll be more careful with my work from now on.

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:19.719
Goodbye.

00:18:21.355 --> 00:18:24.740
Gosh, he's so unfriendly.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.257
He doesn't know how to talk to people.

00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:30.670
So the police went to talk to Yoo Jeong Seok?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.717
I don't know how they found out about us.

00:18:33.717 --> 00:18:35.601
This is actually good.

00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:38.747
You would've had to let them know on purpose otherwise.

00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:41.876
There must be pressure in order to make him nervous.

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:46.533
He'll keep helping you out because he'll be worried about himself.

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:56.236
I'm grateful that you are helping me out,

00:18:56.236 --> 00:19:00.340
but I wonder what you want in return.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.150
What's the ending that you want from this?

00:19:04.867 --> 00:19:11.986
I want to see the people who made me go to court standing in court as well.

00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:17.042
What if I don't really want to see that?

00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:23.364
Then we'll probably see you in court instead, even though that's not what I initially pictured.

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:27.966
You're good at making threats.

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:31.542
I just had the same thought too.

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:37.231
You know how to use nice words to say that I'll die if I step out of line.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.160
[Kang Do Chang]

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.065
Yes?

00:20:10.065 --> 00:20:12.475
Where are you? Are you at the office?

00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:15.025
No, I'm out right now.

00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:17.812
Reporter Jin told me everything.

00:20:17.812 --> 00:20:20.790
Your superiors made you take the blame.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.151
So what?

00:20:22.151 --> 00:20:28.959
Did you want to say it serves me right after what I did?

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:30.128
Want to grab a drink?

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:33.528
No. I'm not upset enough to drink.

00:20:33.528 --> 00:20:35.225
Right.

00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:37.309
You're a strong person.

00:20:38.017 --> 00:20:39.817
Seonbaenim.

00:20:41.828 --> 00:20:43.668
Don't you hate me?

00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:46.048
I hated you for a brief moment.

00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:48.922
It's not like you wanted to do that.

00:20:48.922 --> 00:20:52.689
You had no choice since your superiors made you do it.

00:20:54.531 --> 00:20:56.495
Seonbae, I hate you.

00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:57.384
Why?

00:20:57.384 --> 00:20:59.584
Because I do.

00:20:59.584 --> 00:21:01.125
Why are you like that?

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:03.039
Can you be at least a little mean?

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:07.640
You should say some mean things to people and do some mean things to them too.

00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:12.836
So a bad person like me will feel better about herself.

00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:17.008
Hey, I would've lived like you, too, if I were as smart as you.

00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:18.736
I'm like this because I'm stupid.

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.436
No.

00:21:20.436 --> 00:21:22.273
That's not true.

00:21:22.837 --> 00:21:26.723
It's because I'm a bad person.

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:28.807
Yoon Sang Mi.

00:21:28.807 --> 00:21:30.237
Cheer up.

00:21:30.237 --> 00:21:33.449
You said you made a promise to your grandmother, who raised you.

00:21:33.449 --> 00:21:36.189
You promised her that she'd see you become successful.

00:21:36.189 --> 00:21:38.412
You have to keep that promise.

00:21:43.048 --> 00:21:45.854
Yes, of course.

00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:50.125
I forgot about that for a second.

00:21:53.822 --> 00:21:55.587
Thank you, seonbaenim.

00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:18.468
Help me out just one more time.

00:22:18.468 --> 00:22:22.596
You'll be able to get the records from the retrial at Lawyer So's office.

00:22:22.596 --> 00:22:24.823
Can you bring them to me? I'll let him know you're coming.

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:26.416
- Right now?
- Yes.

00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:30.154
Will you be okay by yourself? You can't even go to the bathroom by yourself.

00:22:31.764 --> 00:22:34.764
- Hello.
- Hello

00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.003
Don't worry. You can go.

00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:43.996
Reporter Jin, if Detective Oh needs to use the bathroom,

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:46.328
give him the urine container under his bed.

00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:47.802
M-Me?

00:22:47.802 --> 00:22:48.759
Hey!

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:50.982
I can take care of that myself!

00:22:50.982 --> 00:22:52.937
Why would you ask Reporter Jin?

00:22:52.937 --> 00:22:55.644
You shouldn't worry about your pride when you're hurt.

00:22:55.644 --> 00:22:57.140
It's better than peeing in bed.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.830
Just go! Leave already.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.857
Okay.

00:23:00.857 --> 00:23:06.170
And he can't bend down yet, so hold up the container for him and look away.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.894
Hurry up and go!

00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:09.784
Please just go! Go!

00:23:09.784 --> 00:23:11.980
Anyway, please take care of him for me.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.240
I won't take long.

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:22.191
How did you end up not being able to use the bathroom on your own?

00:23:22.191 --> 00:23:23.892
He's just teasing me.

00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:26.517
Don't worry about it.

00:23:26.517 --> 00:23:28.389
Are you okay?

00:23:29.088 --> 00:23:32.496
I could get discharged right away.

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:38.738
I met Oh Jong Tae with my senior manager a couple of days ago,

00:23:38.738 --> 00:23:42.482
and Oh Jong Tae said something jokingly.

00:23:42.482 --> 00:23:47.924
He said if he were to kill anyone, it would've been Jang Jin Soo.

00:23:47.924 --> 00:23:51.256
Why would he say that in front of my senior manager?

00:23:51.256 --> 00:23:53.159
He's asking him to protect him.

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:55.340
Why would he say that when I was there too?

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.110
He was using you to send a message to your senior manager.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:02.545
He was warning him that he can reveal his cards too.

00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:06.743
They probably made some sort of agreement after that meeting.

00:24:06.743 --> 00:24:09.090
And that's why

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.700
he had the confidence to stab a detective.

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:19.749
I became a journalist because of my senior manager.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.177
He was also the one who got me into the headquarters office.

00:24:22.177 --> 00:24:27.018
To be honest, I want to be like him as a journalist.

00:24:27.018 --> 00:24:31.348
You should get out of that mindset now.

00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:34.224
It won't be easy.

00:24:34.224 --> 00:24:37.718
No, it's easier than you think.

00:24:37.718 --> 00:24:42.262
All you have to do is stay true to yourself.

00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:51.015
[Reporter Baek: There's a meeting at 16:30 (4:30pm) today. The senior manager wants everyone there.]

00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:55.212
I need to get going.

00:24:57.236 --> 00:24:58.760
Don't overwork yourself too much.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.456
Please.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.420
- Yes, hello, I am...
- We are still checking.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.850
- Where is it right now?
- Hello?

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:17.850
Ah, I see.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.010
...would that be possible?

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.060
Okay, I'll reach out again later.

00:25:24.032 --> 00:25:25.947
Senior Manager! They're not answering. What should I do?

00:25:25.947 --> 00:25:27.067
You can't reach them?

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:30.013
Copy the media and upload five pages. We need to fill up the page for now.

00:25:30.013 --> 00:25:34.424
Copy the media without confirming them? That's not right!

00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:37.206
You're Reporter Jin Seo Kyeong, right?

00:25:37.206 --> 00:25:38.764
Yes, what's this about?

00:25:38.764 --> 00:25:41.633
My dad was unfairly assaulted.

00:25:41.633 --> 00:25:42.991
Can you please help me?

00:25:42.991 --> 00:25:44.016
I'm sorry but─

00:25:44.016 --> 00:25:45.803
I saw the article that you wrote.

00:25:45.803 --> 00:25:47.908
You take the side of people who were treated unfairly!

00:25:47.908 --> 00:25:49.724
Please help my dad out!

00:25:49.724 --> 00:25:51.891
I have no one. No one is on his side.

00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:55.259
- I'm sorry, I'm really busy right now. Next time─
- Excuse me, you need to leave.

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:58.370
- Please listen to his story! Reporter Jin! Please listen to his story!
- Let's go.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.620
- Are we going to publish a blank paper? Do what I told you to do!
- Reporter Jin, Reporter Jin!

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.750
Please listen to his story!

00:26:06.113 --> 00:26:09.374
She's here to give me a story. Don't treat her like that.

00:26:09.374 --> 00:26:11.843
Let's talk outside.

00:26:18.235 --> 00:26:21.575
I don't have too much time because of the deadline.

00:26:21.575 --> 00:26:26.085
Please send the story to my email and text me as soon as you've sent it.

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:29.054
I knew you would listen to me.

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.518
Thank you so much!

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:36.828
You should go. I'll contact you after I read your email.

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.352
Okay.

00:26:39.335 --> 00:26:41.460
Thank you!

00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:45.819
Seonbae, thank you so much!

00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:48.036
Thank you!

00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:50.954
Thank you!

00:26:56.359 --> 00:27:00.696
All you have to do is stay true to yourself.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:14.325
Why did you help Lee Dae Cheol during his retrial?

00:27:14.325 --> 00:27:16.478
You made a deal with him beforehand, right?

00:27:16.478 --> 00:27:18.388
What did he offer you?

00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:22.684
He told you he would pay you if he won the retrial, right?

00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:24.011
What are you talking about?

00:27:24.011 --> 00:27:27.390
Didn't you do it for a big payment?

00:27:28.338 --> 00:27:30.158
Do you really have nothing better to do?

00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:32.679
I heard you live with his daughter.

00:27:32.679 --> 00:27:34.397
Why is that?

00:27:34.397 --> 00:27:38.068
You're trying to take Lee Dae Cheol's fortune, right?

00:27:38.068 --> 00:27:39.808
Even you guys think this is ridiculous, huh?

00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:41.610
You're embarrassed to say it, right?

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.033
Do you really think this makes sense?

00:27:43.033 --> 00:27:47.168
You need money to pay the lawyer for your sister's divorce, right?

00:27:47.168 --> 00:27:53.199
Why did the lawyer in charge of your sister's divorce also take the retrial case?

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:54.970
Did you make a deal with the lawyer?

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.932
Did you agree to split the money with him?

00:27:56.932 --> 00:27:59.596
Damn it!

00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:02.548
Let's end it here.

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:06.661
If you keep denying it, we'll have to keep coming back here.

00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:10.811
Who is it?

00:28:10.811 --> 00:28:13.804
Who told you to do this?

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:17.732
The auditing department found gift certificates last time, right?

00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:21.226
I heard Detective Kang helped you out with that.

00:28:22.078 --> 00:28:25.049
Detective Kang used that as an excuse to make his request, right?

00:28:25.049 --> 00:28:29.387
He asked you to help him out with Lee Dae Cheol's retrial, didn't he?

00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:31.540
I'm asking you a question. Please answer it.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.976
Damn it...

00:28:33.976 --> 00:28:37.853
I won't waste my breath on a question like that.

00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:42.132
Why do you think Detective Kang got involved with Lee Dae Cheol's retrial?

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:45.156
Because, as a detective, he couldn't let it go.

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:46.383
There's no other reason.

00:28:46.383 --> 00:28:49.882
So he went as far as to claim innocence for a suspect he arrested?

00:28:49.882 --> 00:28:51.606
That doesn't make sense.

00:28:51.606 --> 00:28:54.885
You're the ones who don't make sense.

00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:57.655
- Look into these two's bank accounts.
- Yes, sir.

00:28:57.655 --> 00:29:03.118
You'll have to explain in detail about any deposits besides your salary.

00:29:06.063 --> 00:29:09.764
I've taken care of Violent Crimes Team 2 at Incheon's West Police Department.

00:29:09.764 --> 00:29:12.992
Got it. Let's grab some food together sometime.

00:29:12.992 --> 00:29:14.616
Bye.

00:29:18.515 --> 00:29:19.823
Reporter Baek.

00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:21.366
Yes?

00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:26.407
Ask them to make the title bigger here. And make this title smaller.

00:29:26.407 --> 00:29:27.679
Yes, sir.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:32.535
And I think Reporter Jin is having a hard time adjusting to the headquarters.

00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:34.315
She's not able to get the point of the articles.

00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:37.349
Yes, that's what I thought, too.

00:29:37.349 --> 00:29:40.140
Don't make her work on anything new. Let's see how it goes.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.592
Understood.

00:29:52.523 --> 00:29:55.990
Your brother got treated for alcoholism.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.239
That's my family's private matter.

00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:00.929
Why do I have to talk about that here?

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:04.635
- And Detective Kang illegally got him a job, right?
- What?

00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:08.451
Detective Kang asked the labor union to take him in.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.149
Should we go inspect the labor union office at the factory

00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:14.278
where your brother is working?

00:30:29.185 --> 00:30:30.848
Hey, you...

00:30:30.848 --> 00:30:32.459
This way.

00:30:43.261 --> 00:30:46.862
- You're back.
- What did they ask you?

00:30:46.862 --> 00:30:49.349
I'm sure they made a big deal out of something ridiculous.

00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:51.703
Hey, don't worry about it.

00:30:51.703 --> 00:30:53.692
It's obvious what they want.

00:30:53.692 --> 00:30:56.631
We can't let them shake us.

00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:58.833
Hang in there.

00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:00.764
- Team Leader.
- Yes?

00:31:00.764 --> 00:31:02.735
I'm sorry but...

00:31:04.328 --> 00:31:07.087
I'm not feeling well.

00:31:07.087 --> 00:31:08.510
Would it be okay if I go let it out somehow?

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.770
Of course. You should go clear your mind.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.659
You bastard!

00:31:39.659 --> 00:31:42.709
How dare you talk about my brother!

00:31:44.768 --> 00:31:49.140
I'll kill you if you mess with my family again!

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:52.143
Bastards!

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.853
Bastards!

00:32:03.198 --> 00:32:05.676
I feel better now.

00:32:05.676 --> 00:32:08.185
- I'm okay now.
- Oh, okay.

00:32:08.185 --> 00:32:11.018
That's good but...

00:32:11.018 --> 00:32:12.372
I'll pay for all the broken stuff.

00:32:12.372 --> 00:32:15.550
No, that's not necessary.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.091
Hey!

00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:21.142
You don't get paid much.

00:32:21.142 --> 00:32:23.281
I'll pay for it!

00:32:24.747 --> 00:32:26.147
Hey!

00:32:26.147 --> 00:32:29.230
You think you're all that because you work in an office?

00:32:31.286 --> 00:32:34.619
Why are you messing with innocent people?

00:32:36.894 --> 00:32:40.075
Hey, you dirty bastards!

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:45.025
All you guys do is talk! Damn!

00:32:45.864 --> 00:32:47.893
- That's mine!
- Just let him be!

00:32:47.893 --> 00:32:51.846
I'll pay for this stuff. Go ahead.

00:32:55.317 --> 00:32:56.917
Thanks.

00:33:02.341 --> 00:33:03.841
Yes, Chief.

00:33:05.833 --> 00:33:07.433
What?

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:16.723
You admit that you faked a kidnapping with Park Geon Ho, right?

00:33:16.723 --> 00:33:19.729
Why didn't the investigation into that incident proceed?

00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:22.459
Did Detective Kang help you out?

00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:24.364
I don't know.

00:33:24.364 --> 00:33:28.927
Could it be that Detective Kang made any other requests?

00:33:28.927 --> 00:33:31.052
- Excuse me?
- You know...

00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:34.500
Detective Kang is a man after all.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.870
Eun Hye.

00:33:42.638 --> 00:33:46.712
Tell me exactly what you said to her, word for word.

00:33:46.712 --> 00:33:52.134
You're dead if you get even one word wrong.

00:33:52.134 --> 00:33:54.303
We didn't say much.

00:33:54.303 --> 00:33:56.121
We talked about Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:58.156
That's her deceased father.

00:33:58.156 --> 00:34:01.368
Why would you hurt her like that? Why? Why!

00:34:01.368 --> 00:34:04.181
Why? Why?

00:34:06.489 --> 00:34:08.689
You should watch what you say.

00:34:08.689 --> 00:34:12.710
Are you afraid we'll find out what's going on between you two?

00:34:14.606 --> 00:34:16.106
You piece of...

00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:18.396
What do you think you're doing?

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:30.035
I said, what do you think you're doing?

00:34:30.035 --> 00:34:34.095
Why are you here interfering with the work of our detectives?

00:34:34.095 --> 00:34:35.325
This is our job.

00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:37.613
Then why didn't you report to me first?

00:34:37.613 --> 00:34:40.971
You think you're important because you work at headquarters?

00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:44.720
You ignored ranks and the duty to report.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.796
This is abuse of authority.

00:34:46.796 --> 00:34:48.443
If you want to mess with my guys,

00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:54.051
you'd better write up the exact reason and details of the inspection and bring it to me.

00:34:54.051 --> 00:35:00.368
And you even brought in a minor without any permission?

00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:04.449
Should we go over what you did wrong with the Human Rights Committee?

00:35:04.449 --> 00:35:07.106
These detectives that you look down on,

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:12.281
while you sit at your desks digging up dirt on them,

00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:18.792
they sacrifice their own safety to arrest criminals.

00:35:20.598 --> 00:35:22.098
You should...

00:35:24.153 --> 00:35:29.987
put your hand on your heart and recite the police pledge again.

00:35:29.987 --> 00:35:32.618
Then you'll realize

00:35:32.618 --> 00:35:38.868
who the real police officer is between him and you guys.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.020
[The People's Police, A Righteous Republic of Korea]

00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:53.677
Kang Do Chang!

00:35:53.677 --> 00:35:56.076
- Yes, sir?
- Come here for a second.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.820
You see the car over there? Plate 8761?

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.249
Wait in there. I'll unlock it for you.

00:36:03.254 --> 00:36:04.954
Go.

00:36:04.954 --> 00:36:06.397
Yes?

00:36:08.442 --> 00:36:13.432
Buy Eun Hye some good food on the way.

00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:15.981
You better tell her it's from me.

00:36:17.223 --> 00:36:19.234
Keep it.

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:22.505
It's a bit small to say I got it from the chief.

00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:24.591
Damn it.

00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:30.606
Happy? What a thief.

00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:32.106
Thank you, sir.

00:36:44.426 --> 00:36:46.247
Should we listen to some music?

00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:50.638
- There's no station at this hour that will play the music I like.
- Oh,

00:36:50.638 --> 00:36:52.592
I see.

00:36:52.592 --> 00:36:55.651
Do you need anything?

00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:58.235
Stop trying to do stuff for me.

00:36:58.235 --> 00:36:59.796
You've done more than enough.

00:36:59.796 --> 00:37:02.085
I'm not saying I'm going to buy you something.

00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:04.048
The chief gave me money to get you something.

00:37:04.048 --> 00:37:07.305
It's not me, I swear.

00:37:08.629 --> 00:37:14.752
Then we'll just pick up some meat and eat it together at home.

00:37:14.752 --> 00:37:18.057
There is something I want to get.

00:37:18.057 --> 00:37:19.651
What? What is it?

00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:21.552
Just say the word.

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:23.255
The chief gave me a lot of money.

00:37:23.255 --> 00:37:25.788
What? What do you want to buy?

00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:32.419
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, that's it.

00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:35.584
I'll get the plaster figure. Wait for me outside.

00:37:38.598 --> 00:37:39.998
How much is it?

00:37:39.998 --> 00:37:42.104
It's 168,000 won (~$168).

00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:44.635
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:37:45.614 --> 00:37:47.975
Your daughter must be preparing to go to art school.

00:37:47.975 --> 00:37:51.088
No, she just likes to draw.

00:37:53.645 --> 00:37:58.049
Was everything that we bought what you need to prepare for an art school?

00:37:58.049 --> 00:37:59.952
Yes, of course.

00:38:03.692 --> 00:38:06.213
There's some money left.

00:38:06.213 --> 00:38:11.791
Should we get a cake and throw a party?

00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:14.150
A party for what?

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:20.190
Just because the weather has gotten nicer.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.747
Okay.

00:38:21.747 --> 00:38:23.580
Okay! Deal!

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.409
There's a really good bakery up that hill.

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:28.266
Let's get one there.

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:30.867
Don't you think this plaster figure will look really

00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:33.302
scary if you see it in the middle of the night?

00:38:33.302 --> 00:38:35.210
A detective shouldn't be scared of that.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.666
I'm really scared of ghosts!

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.192
Ghosts are not real.

00:38:39.192 --> 00:38:42.017
Yes, they are! There's a ghost that stalks me.

00:38:42.017 --> 00:38:43.511
A very pretty ghost.

00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.502
Even a ghost can tell who's handsome.

00:38:46.502 --> 00:38:47.902
Hey, no way.

00:38:47.902 --> 00:38:49.426
What?

00:38:50.747 --> 00:38:53.332
You haven't been to that really good bakery yet, right?

00:38:53.332 --> 00:38:54.556
No.

00:38:54.556 --> 00:38:57.514
They give you one free bread if you buy three.

00:38:57.514 --> 00:39:00.170
- Really?
- Really!

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.815
- You always think I'm lying.
- They're so generous.

00:39:02.815 --> 00:39:05.354
They have reward points too.

00:39:05.354 --> 00:39:07.068
Guess how many points you get for buying one bread item.

00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:08.992
Three points?

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.956
What are you going to do with three points?

00:39:14.956 --> 00:39:17.055
You should get at least ten points.

[Incheon West Police Station]

00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:23.870
Oh Jong Tae is never going to confess to conspiring to commit murder.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.091
There's no need for him to confess when he has people watching his back for him.

00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:30.997
The biggest reason the prosecutor decided to indict him without detention

00:39:30.997 --> 00:39:33.193
is because he thinks there's no motive.

00:39:33.193 --> 00:39:38.017
If we find evidence for Yoon Ji Seon and Jang Jin Soo's murder,

00:39:38.017 --> 00:39:39.819
it will prove Oh Jong Tae's motive.

00:39:39.819 --> 00:39:43.527
But I thought all of that was revealed during Lee Dae Cheol's retrial.

00:39:43.527 --> 00:39:45.351
No.

00:39:45.351 --> 00:39:48.864
We only looked for evidence for a poorly conducted investigation.

00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:51.618
We didn't have enough evidence to prove that Oh Jong Tae was the killer.

00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:55.394
But will we be able to find evidence for something that happened six years ago?

00:39:55.394 --> 00:39:57.419
We have to find it.

00:39:57.419 --> 00:40:00.098
My goal isn't to lock him up for conspiring to commit murder.

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:04.003
It's to expose the fact that he framed Lee Dae Cheol

00:40:04.003 --> 00:40:07.270
and to let the world know about Lee Dae Cheol's unfair death.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.986
Yes, we have to avenge his death.

00:40:10.986 --> 00:40:13.182
What was clearly determined during the trial was

00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:15.864
that Nam Gook Hyeon fabricated the evidence.

00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:18.374
Nam Gook Hyeon found Oh Jong Tae's watch at the scene,

00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:22.229
and that's how a connection formed between the two.

00:40:22.229 --> 00:40:24.615
Oh Jong Tae's father,

00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:30.719
my uncle, probably paid Nam Gook Hyeon to hide what really happened.

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:34.631
But do you think my uncle believed that his son had killed

00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:39.118
someone just because his watch was found at the scene?

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:42.948
I'm saying Nam Gook Hyeon probably showed him something else that proved it.

00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:48.745
So you think Nam Gook Hyeon still has that definitive piece of evidence?

00:40:48.745 --> 00:40:52.114
Wouldn't he have gotten rid of it? Why would he keep that?

00:40:52.114 --> 00:40:56.017
He even kept the watch that was found at a murder scene.

00:40:56.017 --> 00:41:00.006
If he intended to take money from Oh Jong Tae for the rest of his life,

00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:02.269
he might still have it.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.703
Okay! Let's look for it.

00:41:06.703 --> 00:41:09.919
Don't miss a thing, and get every single proof.

00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:12.862
Hey. We went through a lot to get to where we are right now.

00:41:12.862 --> 00:41:17.039
It all will have been for nothing if Oh Jong Tae gets released again.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:19.775
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

00:41:31.986 --> 00:41:34.306

Yes, how can I help you?

We're detectives who used to work with him.

00:41:49.432 --> 00:41:51.390
We need to check some things.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.996
Would it be okay to look inside the house?

00:41:52.996 --> 00:41:55.343
What's this about?

00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:04.782
We have no other choice.

So frustrating.

00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:22.747
It has been a while since I've talked to him.

00:42:23.347 --> 00:42:25.260
Ah, yeah, I understand.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.997
In case you hear from him, please give me a call.

00:42:28.997 --> 00:42:32.280
Okay. Why are you looking for him anyway?

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.137
Don't you guys work at the same station?

00:42:34.137 --> 00:42:36.628
He submitted a letter of resignation and left.

00:42:36.628 --> 00:42:39.561
- Why?
- He's hiding a lot of things.

00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:44.405
He quit his job and went into hiding so he doesn't get exposed.

00:42:45.324 --> 00:42:52.362
Then is he also hiding something which proves who killed my husband?

00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:57.441
There's a high possibility that he knows who it was.

00:42:58.253 --> 00:43:00.153
I see.

00:43:00.153 --> 00:43:04.258
So he was hiding a lot of stuff from me too.

00:43:05.574 --> 00:43:10.410
A few days ago, Hyeon Joo asked me if the man

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.216
who was executed is the one who killed her dad.

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:16.447
I had no choice but to tell her yes.

00:43:16.447 --> 00:43:19.347
But I couldn't sleep after saying that.

00:43:19.965 --> 00:43:25.583
I felt so sorry for the man who died.

00:43:26.488 --> 00:43:30.573
I promise you that we'll get the real killer.

00:43:30.573 --> 00:43:35.175
We'll find out who it is for Jin Soo's sake.

It's fine.

Have you found Detective Jang's body?

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:39.993
Was it an accidental murder?

00:45:39.993 --> 00:45:41.151
Probably.

00:45:41.151 --> 00:45:44.918
Who would want to kill a detective on purpose?

00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:53.470
There are CCTV cameras installed ten minutes away from here in either direction of the road.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.390
The killer would've buried the body in that direction within the ten-minute distance.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.618
There's a patrol station in the other direction.

00:46:00.618 --> 00:46:03.942
I'm sure he headed in the opposite direction.

00:46:05.492 --> 00:46:08.750
It took exactly 8 minutes and 20 seconds to get here from the scene of the murder.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.002
There were no cameras along the way.

00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:12.728
He probably...

00:46:14.891 --> 00:46:17.092
parked his car somewhere there.

00:46:17.116 --> 00:46:22.189
That's the only place you can hide the car and not be seen from the road. And...

00:46:22.189 --> 00:46:24.723
If he moved the body alone,

00:46:28.836 --> 00:46:32.195
this would be a good place since it doesn't have any incline.

00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:36.018

Yes.

00:50:46.751 --> 00:50:50.111
An office worker drove the car here and asked us to scrap it.

00:50:50.111 --> 00:50:54.818
Later that day, a detective came to collect evidence from that car.

00:50:54.828 --> 00:50:57.962
And did the detective say anything to you?

00:50:57.962 --> 00:51:00.104
He asked me to hold off on scrapping the car

00:51:00.104 --> 00:51:01.901
because it's an important piece of evidence.

00:51:01.901 --> 00:51:04.070
But he never contacted me again.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.621
I scrapped it after waiting for three days.

00:51:08.383 --> 00:51:10.809
It was Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:51:10.809 --> 00:51:15.338
He took evidence from the car and blackmailed Oh Jong Tae and his father with it.

- It's okay.

00:51:57.274 --> 00:52:00.796
This increases the likelihood that Jang Jin Soo and Nam Gook Hyeon could've been accomplices.

Nothing much.

Did you forget that I'm the one who turned in evidence about Kim Gi Tae's corruption?

00:52:31.393 --> 00:52:34.824

that he's not clean either, right?

No, his wife told us that he didn't bring any money home.
