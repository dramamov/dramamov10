(Episode 8)

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:26.154
I could beg him for forgiveness
a hundred times.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.825
But what if it's too late?

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:33.411
I should've done that immediately
when it happened.

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:37.874
Your guest is here.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:54.808
This will never happen again.

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:57.310
I'm well aware
of what I did wrong.

00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:59.020
But if you forgive me,

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:01.898
I will never upset you again.

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:05.693
Honey.

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:09.447
Honey?

00:01:11.032 --> 00:01:12.075
Lee Yu-an?

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.096
Is this why you wanted me
to bring our kids along?

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.414
To show this side of you?

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:18.790
Why didn't you bring the kids?

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:21.042
Did they not want to see you?

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.293
No.

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:24.587
- They went to a learning center.
- I see.

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:27.048
I needed to talk to you too.

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:27.966
Don't.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.010
What now? Can you keep working?

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.555
Oh, I thought...

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:36.808
Why is Nam Wan-seong so desperate

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.436
to bring you down?

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:42.230
Because his son got arrested
for selling drugs.

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:43.397
I mean,

00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:46.192
why is he blaming you
for his son's fault?

00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:49.045
To stop his son
from ending up in prison.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.155
He threatened the witness

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.198
and attempted to frame
the dead girl.

00:01:52.323 --> 00:01:54.826
So I prosecuted his son
to serve him right.

00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.161
What a lunatic.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:58.788
What are you doing here?
Go out there and arrest him.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:00.915
So you can at least
explain yourself.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.625
I will get him.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.002
I swear I'll take him down,

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:06.337
but to do that,

00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:11.676
the land...

00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.097
The land...

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:18.600
The land? What land?

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:19.809
I'm sorry, honey.

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.313
Seo Dong-jae, you dumbass!

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:28.026
Shoot.

00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:35.407
Is that the only way?

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.325
Yes.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.120
Nam Wan-seong's probably waiting
for his moment to disclose it.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.416
I guess that leaves us no choice.

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.085
The first truth out of your mouth

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:47.754
is that?

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:48.755
Thank you.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.048
Can't you not thank me
for something like this?

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:52.467
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:53.635
But

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:55.428
only if you understand it,

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.515
I'll be able to go for it
without looking back.

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:01.934
I'll be able to bust
Nam Wan-seong's ass.

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.446
- Write it down.
- Oh.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.659
I, Seo Dong-jae...

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.204
No, Lee Yu-an's husband
Seo Dong-jae...

Honey.

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:27.001
Like I always say,
an oath has no effect...

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.462
Go ahead.

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.756
If I fail to do the following,

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:35.134
I will give up on all my fortune
and custody of my children

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:36.970
and agree

00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:39.097

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.811
- I will
- I will...

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.438
arrest Nam Wan-seong
with my hands

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:49.941
to redeem myself.

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:55.405
Two.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:00.868
I must not get involved
in any scandals

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:04.163
related to money or sexual escort.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.381
When it gets warmer, we should
go for a round in my club.

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:58.593
I didn't get myself involved
in any way.

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.429
It was
all that prosecutor's doing.

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:04.682
Yet he prosecuted my son.

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:06.976
Isn't that revenge?

00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:09.020
My son wasn't the first victim

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:10.813
he framed.

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:12.357
It's habitual.

00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:14.859
I cannot believe
that a man like him

00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:16.903
is still working as a prosecutor.

00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:20.363
Please calm down.
You brought something?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.532
Yes.

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.953
Now that he's a law firm owner?
So what?

00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:28.665
He thinks he's so big now.

00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:33.628
I saw him next to his dad
since he was this little.

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.341
First of all,
you're ahead of this game.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.175
I wonder
how Seo Dong-jae will react

00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:42.929
if Kang Won-cheol becomes
Gyeo-rye's attorney.

00:05:43.054 --> 00:05:45.765
You'll meet him soon.
You'll be working together.

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:47.809
Me?

00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.310
With Kang Won-cheol?

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:52.104
If he doesn't prepare
the trial thoroughly

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.441
just because Seo Dong-jae's
his junior,

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:56.858
report it to me right away.

00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:59.570
I'll sue him for malpractice.

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:01.906
Yes, sir.

00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:04.117
I wonder if he'd still adore
a problematic junior

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:06.077
like Seo Dong-jae.

00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:07.995
No, he shouldn't.

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.833
Oh, the director asked me when you
are available for the next shoot.

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:14.394
You announced a second
disclosure on Prosecutor Seo.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.379
The first one was a hit.

00:06:16.504 --> 00:06:17.880
It was pretty influential.

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:22.676
The whole nation is against
Prosecutor Seo now.

00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:25.346
Right.
If you also reveal the land issue,

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.932
If you also reveal the land issue,

00:06:28.474 --> 00:06:29.851
Seo Dong-jae will be...

00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:31.227
Fired.

00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:33.812
And my sweet dirt on him
will become trash.

00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:39.152
Don't you think Kang Won-cheol has
an attitude problem?

00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:41.946
Why do you think I went out
of my way to meet a jerk like him?

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:44.198
Right.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.202
Kang Won-cheol worked
as a chief prosecutor.

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:51.122
No matter who takes the case
after Prosecutor Seo gets fired,

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:52.540
he'll still be influential.

00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:56.169
If it's about anything else,

00:06:56.294 --> 00:06:58.212
you won't have to worry.

00:06:58.337 --> 00:06:59.380
Anything else?

00:07:00.423 --> 00:07:01.883
Even if the land becomes an issue.

00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:03.551
You have nothing to worry about.

00:07:03.676 --> 00:07:05.803
Because the statute of limitations
for bribery is...

00:07:05.887 --> 00:07:07.138
10 years.

00:07:07.764 --> 00:07:10.183
You think I didn't check that?
What do you take me for?

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:13.144
You knew that's passed already?

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:14.395
Of course.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.732
Whoever took it may forget about
it, but I can even give the date.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.484
Oh.

00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.405
Seo Dong-jae's not worth a penny
unless he's a prosecutor.

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.406
I can't let him become a civilian
that easily.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.617
I'll squeeze him

00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:29.994
to every last drop.

00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:33.289
Right.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:37.752
Are you making a lot
from the channel?

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.171
This isn't about money.

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:44.133
It's for you and to keep my word
with my subscribers.

00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:46.844
Hello?

00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:51.474

00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:55.895
- Get out.
- Bye.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.063
When?

00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:00.817
How did the reporter find out
about the junkie in the storage?

00:08:01.317 --> 00:08:03.903
If any traces are left,
get rid of them all.

00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:08.658
And find out if she was
really a reporter. Got it?

00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:11.118
As you know as a tax accountant,

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.704
all businessmen do it, right?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.499
I heard Ehong Construction has
many issues.

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:17.667
Any dirt on them?

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:19.502
Like tax evasion.

00:08:20.378 --> 00:08:21.420
What?

00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:26.008
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

00:08:26.592 --> 00:08:29.387
Can I borrow a smoke?

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:30.555
Sure.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.517
I guess they let you smoke?

00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:36.727
It doesn't take
that long to smoke.

00:08:36.853 --> 00:08:39.021
If they won't let me,
I'd rather quit.

00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:41.482

Oh, Ehong Construction?

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.864
- Do you know?
- I've heard about it.

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.783
That they're thriving in Cheongju.

00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:52.243
By the way,

00:08:52.368 --> 00:08:56.038
do they make sure to keep you safe
and pay you for overtime?

about bribery as well?

I'll tell you everything
next time.

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.149
I don't know anything about it.

00:10:08.443 --> 00:10:10.154
What's on e-pros?

00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:16.494
Nice.

00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:23.084
Hello?

00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:25.920
What?

00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:30.091
Does that mean
we've lost our item?

00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:34.386
Shoot, it was a chance
to raise the views.

00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:35.596
That's discouraging.

00:10:38.307 --> 00:10:39.767
No, wait.

00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:41.684
Hang on.

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:44.105
One second.

00:10:55.074 --> 00:10:56.909
What did he spill?

00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:58.119
Everything.

00:10:58.244 --> 00:10:59.912
You know the intranet
for prosecutors?

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:03.124
The prosecutors post this and that
there every day.

00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:04.709
And Seo Dong-jae...

00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:07.461
Last night,
when I left the office,

00:11:07.586 --> 00:11:09.838
I saw the banner to fire

00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.066
manipulative, violent, and
corrupted Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.635
I'm sure a lot of people
who passed the office saw it.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.971
I'm ashamed.

00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:19.515
I'm well aware

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.018
that my past wrongdoing is
tying me down

00:11:22.143 --> 00:11:23.393
like the scarlet letter.

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:26.981
That he met you
when he was a rascal,

00:11:27.106 --> 00:11:29.442
and you gave him the land.

00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:31.944
That's what he posted.

00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:34.530
Then you threatened him with it

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:37.408
and forced him to find
your son innocent.

00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:39.493
What the hell is
that guy thinking?

00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:41.537
He has no shame.

00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:44.247
I hope one day the truth

00:11:44.372 --> 00:11:46.417
about Nam Gyeo-rye's
crime is revealed.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.127
Oh, right. Sir.

00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:51.213
Did you tell Seo Dong-jae
about that too?

00:11:51.338 --> 00:11:52.423
What?

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:54.008
About the redevelopment.

00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:56.177
That you knew about it
through a congressman.

00:11:56.302 --> 00:11:58.471
You bribed a congressman

00:11:58.596 --> 00:12:00.473
to sneak out
the redevelopment plan.

00:12:00.598 --> 00:12:03.642
Then you kicked out the innocent
residents for a dirt cheap price

00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:05.853
and took all that vast land.

00:12:05.978 --> 00:12:07.521
That lunatic.

00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:08.856
That's not all.

00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.068
Because the disciplinary committee
is in progress, he can't quit.

00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.862
He'll follow the result,
so give him some more time.

00:12:14.987 --> 00:12:17.864
He pretended to be

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.366
all conscientious and dignified.

00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:22.369
All his fellows are aware
of the disciplinary committee.

00:12:22.495 --> 00:12:23.995
But why did he bother asking them

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.831
to give him some time
on the intranet?

00:12:25.955 --> 00:12:27.666
He was asking reporters
to spread it.

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:31.879
And the reporters bought it
like a blabbermouth.

00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:34.632
What the hell was
that dumbass thinking?

00:12:34.757 --> 00:12:36.984
Sir, are you going to just sit
on your hands and watch this?

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:39.887
You need to refute.
We need to upload

00:12:40.387 --> 00:12:41.514
our argument.

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:43.390
Prepare it now.

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:44.558
Yes.

00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:52.566
Yes!

00:12:57.404 --> 00:12:58.530
Let's go for a million.

00:13:00.282 --> 00:13:01.909
Go to your room, you idiot.

00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:05.496
You're in Grade 12, but I've never
seen you sitting on your desk.

00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.498
Are you a student or a bum?

00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:10.184
Pretend to be sorry at least if
you have any sense of conscience.

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:12.878
Go live with your mom,
you piece of crap.

00:13:19.677 --> 00:13:21.887
(Congressman Kim Sang-hoe)

00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:24.723
Yes, congressman.

00:13:26.225 --> 00:13:28.144
Oh, hi, Mr. Secretary.

(for violation of drug control)

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:44.535
(Boss)

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.828
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:45.953 --> 00:13:48.998
Prosecutor Jo,
check Prosecutor Seo's dorm now.

00:13:49.123 --> 00:13:51.584
Now? Me?

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:53.711
Seo Dong-jae's posting on e-pros.

00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.045
I got a bad feeling about it.

00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:57.590
I doubt he'd do that.

00:13:57.715 --> 00:13:59.425
He turned his phone off.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.553
What makes you think
he'd blow the whistle?

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:05.639
He posted that
as if he'd given up on his life

00:14:05.764 --> 00:14:07.099
and turned off his phone.

00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:11.020
If he thinks about anything
stupid, we'll be in big trouble.

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:12.938
Okay.

00:14:15.107 --> 00:14:17.443
I heard you. Bye.

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:20.571
But it's barely...

00:14:22.364 --> 00:14:24.241
If anything happened to him,
I'll eat my hat.

00:14:25.117 --> 00:14:27.369
Why's she going overboard
for nothing? What a hassle.

00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:39.215
Is this strong enough to hold?

00:14:40.382 --> 00:14:41.592
Hold what?

00:14:44.762 --> 00:14:45.804
What...

00:14:54.605 --> 00:14:58.817
(WEST&EAST Law Firm)

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:02.404
Even if no law firm accepts me,

00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:05.074
I'll never make my family starve.

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:09.954
Crime stories
told by a former prosecutor.

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.081
West And East.

00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:13.749

Don't forget to subscribe and like

00:15:22.174 --> 00:15:24.510

We can do it.

00:15:25.469 --> 00:15:26.345
What's so wrong about that?

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.389
People are doing well,
and so will I.

00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:30.641
I won't die
even if I quit the prosecution.

00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:33.894
It's not the end of the world.

00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:00.879
But that's not the problem here.

00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:03.590
I can't do this alone.

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:06.343
Did Sung Si-woon
go to his parents' house?

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:07.803
I'll help you.

00:16:17.146 --> 00:16:18.188
No. Prosecutor Seo.

00:16:19.064 --> 00:16:21.150
Oh, no. Prosecutor Seo.

00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:26.322
Prosecutor Jo is perfect for this.

00:16:26.363 --> 00:16:27.531
Hey, Byung-gun.

00:16:28.073 --> 00:16:30.701
Will you help me
for the last time?

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.953
No way.

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:39.376
What if he's attempting suicide?

00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:40.544
This is crazy.

00:16:43.213 --> 00:16:44.673
Are you trying to tease me?

00:16:45.007 --> 00:16:47.593
How can you turn your phone off
after what you've done?

00:16:47.718 --> 00:16:49.303
Why are you raising your voice?

00:16:49.428 --> 00:16:51.263
How can I not?

00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:52.698
I almost punched you in the face.

00:16:52.723 --> 00:16:54.308
I thought I had to
prepare a funeral.

00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:56.060
Sorry.

00:16:56.185 --> 00:16:59.188
If you surprised everyone,
you should've at least...

00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:03.692
What?
I'm sorry,
Prosecutor Jo Byung-gun.

00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:05.194
I'm sorry,
Prosecutor Jo Byung-gun.

00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:16.038
You're suspended from work.

00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:20.876
Transfer your work
and wait in the dorm.

00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:30.469
Jo Byung-gun.

00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:37.976
What's that?

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:41.688
My goodness.

00:17:42.898 --> 00:17:44.108
There's something to dig out.

00:17:44.775 --> 00:17:45.943
Dig out?

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.198
His name is Park Jung-woo.

00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.158
Ehong Construction's
subcontract worker.

00:18:08.173 --> 00:18:10.676
The main rebars should be
15cm apart,

00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:12.511
but it was over 30cm.

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:14.430
The mushroom slab columns are

00:18:14.555 --> 00:18:16.598
missing one of three rebars.

00:18:16.723 --> 00:18:19.017
The worker who reported it,
and the testimony.

00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:21.812
He was the one who reported
that it was the construction CEO

00:18:21.937 --> 00:18:23.580
who ordered
the insufficient construction.

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:25.524
That's how he reported
Nam Wan-seong.

00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:26.775
But after he reported it...

00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:28.460
His phone was last used
at the construction site.

00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:29.711
There's no chance
of getting a warrant.

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:31.113
The suspect is clear.

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:33.090
But no one knows
if his body is there.

00:18:33.115 --> 00:18:34.450
But if it's there,

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:37.077
it's a game changer.

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:39.580
What's the point?

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:41.790
Are you taking advantage of Nam
to turn the tables?

00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:44.376
The man who talked bullcrap
about Seo Dong-jae

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.962
turned out to be a murderer.

00:18:47.087 --> 00:18:49.548
I'm sure people won't buy
what Nam Wan-seong says.

00:18:49.673 --> 00:18:51.592
Hey, who's worse?

00:18:51.717 --> 00:18:53.093
Me or Nam Wan-seong?

00:18:53.218 --> 00:18:55.095
There's barely any difference.

00:18:57.764 --> 00:18:59.475
Nam Wan-seong is slightly worse.

00:19:02.186 --> 00:19:03.395
Definitely worse.

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:07.941
Yes.

00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:09.943
I know I'm a mess,

00:19:10.777 --> 00:19:12.821
but he's worse than me,
so I must arrest him.

00:19:17.075 --> 00:19:18.118
The boss will be worried.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.579
No, don't tell her.

00:19:20.704 --> 00:19:22.623
She was worried
that you would've been dead.

00:19:22.748 --> 00:19:24.708
Remember the 100,000-dollar
porcelain incident?

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:27.336
That was supposed to be yours.
How do you think I got it?

00:19:27.461 --> 00:19:28.921
Because it was
a petty car accident?

00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:33.550
Did Nam Wan-seong...

00:19:36.303 --> 00:19:37.804
Prosecutor Kim already knew.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.640
That's why she didn't report it.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.642
Is there anything
she doesn't know about?

00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:48.774
Hey.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.074
You're that wench
from last time, aren't you?

00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:00.327
Come out.

00:20:00.452 --> 00:20:01.537
Find her first.

00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:02.871
Who are they?

00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:07.834
Shoot. He said
no one would be here.

00:20:10.712 --> 00:20:12.631
- The number you have dialed...
- There she is!

00:20:21.472 --> 00:20:23.517
Who are you? A reporter?

00:20:23.976 --> 00:20:26.686
Is she dead?

00:20:26.812 --> 00:20:29.398
Why bother going down? Just
put cement like the last time.

00:20:29.523 --> 00:20:31.441
- With what?
- Do we have any prepared?

00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:32.609
No.

00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:34.069
Then

00:20:35.862 --> 00:20:36.905
let's just bury her.

00:20:37.573 --> 00:20:38.615
Yes.

00:20:44.288 --> 00:20:46.247
Hey, she opened her eyes.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.046
What a joke.

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:02.930
Who the hell are you?

00:21:03.056 --> 00:21:05.225
What the hell are you doing
in our construction site?

00:21:13.692 --> 00:21:14.735
Hey.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.070
Are you deaf?

00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:23.577
- Hey, over there.
- What?

00:21:23.702 --> 00:21:25.037
Isn't that Prosecutor Kim's car?

00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:26.622
It is.

00:21:31.209 --> 00:21:32.836
303... That's the one, right?

00:21:32.961 --> 00:21:35.422
Yes, but why is it empty?

00:21:35.547 --> 00:21:37.590
She should've waited.
She must've gone in first.

00:21:40.594 --> 00:21:41.637
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.055
I had my phone off.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.266
Who are you to blame? Geez.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.477
Perhaps she called me.

00:21:51.897 --> 00:21:52.939
What...

00:21:55.442 --> 00:21:57.778
What? You think we're boasting?

00:21:57.903 --> 00:21:59.613
Spill it out
before I count to three.

00:21:59.738 --> 00:22:02.199
If you piss me off even more,
I'll pour the cement for real.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.994
- Why isn't she picking up?
- Is she not picking up?

00:22:06.703 --> 00:22:07.913
Where is she?

00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:10.374
One,

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.168
two...

00:22:13.794 --> 00:22:14.836
Hello...

00:22:19.633 --> 00:22:20.717
Kim Ji-hee!
Prosecutor Kim!

00:22:22.469 --> 00:22:23.945
What the hell?
What's wrong with her?

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.390
What the hell are you doing?
We haven't even poured it yet.

00:22:28.517 --> 00:22:29.559
Go.

00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:43.865
Take this.

00:22:46.993 --> 00:22:47.911
- Prosecutor?
- Is this real?

00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:49.454
- What's that?
- Prosecutor Kim.

00:22:49.579 --> 00:22:52.082
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Prosecutor Seo? Another one?

00:22:52.207 --> 00:22:54.835
- Over here.
- Shoot.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.044
Over there.

00:22:56.169 --> 00:22:57.546
Here.

00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:58.714
Prosecutor Kim.

00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:00.882
- Are you okay?
- Get them.

00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:02.134
- Hey, go.
- Me?

00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:03.343
- Go.
- Alone?

00:23:04.219 --> 00:23:05.262
Hurry.

00:23:08.014 --> 00:23:09.307
Let me see. Are you okay?

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:11.309
- You'll miss him.
- No, don't move.

00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:14.311
You're bleeding from your head.

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:19.317
Shoot, where did they go?

00:23:19.443 --> 00:23:21.027
Stop right there. Hey.

00:23:21.987 --> 00:23:23.029
Geez.

00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:25.907
Gosh.

00:23:27.074 --> 00:23:28.577
I saw your faces!

00:23:31.955 --> 00:23:33.181
Do we have anything to press it?

00:23:33.206 --> 00:23:34.791
How do you feel? Dizzy?

00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:36.626
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

00:23:39.921 --> 00:23:40.964
Did you miss them?

00:23:43.675 --> 00:23:44.426
Shoot.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.261
Fast like runners...

00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:47.804
Damn it.

00:24:14.664 --> 00:24:16.874
(Cheongju General Hospital)

00:24:28.929 --> 00:24:31.181
One civic group reported
an alleged fraud

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:33.850
regarding Ehong Construction's
redevelopment.

00:24:34.643 --> 00:24:37.521
They filed a report
urging an investigation

00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:40.190
on Ehong Construction CEO's
suspicion based on

00:24:40.315 --> 00:24:43.443
the posting written by Prosecutor
Seo from Cheongju District.

00:24:44.653 --> 00:24:47.989
Do you think
the redevelopment corruption

00:24:48.114 --> 00:24:49.533
will be sent to the 9th floor

00:24:49.658 --> 00:24:51.910
or consider it a property issue
and send it to us?

00:24:53.328 --> 00:24:54.371
9th floor.

00:24:54.454 --> 00:24:55.664
Why? She might give it to us.

00:24:55.747 --> 00:24:59.375
You may be a concerned party,
but you're suspended from work.

00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:00.752
It has to go to the 9th floor.

00:25:03.046 --> 00:25:04.381
Are they the same people

00:25:04.506 --> 00:25:06.842
who kidnapped Park Chan-hyuk?
That CEO.

00:25:06.967 --> 00:25:08.301
What happened to him?

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:10.302
Nothing new. Still searching.

00:25:12.556 --> 00:25:13.890
- Oh.
- Prosecutor Kim.

00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:15.600
Are you okay? Where's she going?

00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:17.018
She's getting a head CT scan.

00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:19.788
What were you thinking
to go in there by yourself?

00:25:19.813 --> 00:25:21.439
No wonder your head got smashed.

00:25:22.232 --> 00:25:23.984
Can you tell him
to keep his mouth shut?

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:26.127
What's that attitude? Do you know
what Mr. Seo went through today?

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:27.195
Stop it.

00:25:28.738 --> 00:25:30.323
- One second.
- Yes.

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:33.410
That was...

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.580
That was the grave.

00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:37.747
Did you see anything?

00:25:37.831 --> 00:25:41.001
It seems they've buried people in
the construction site with cement.

00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:43.753
Why bother going down? Just
put cement like the last time.

00:25:43.879 --> 00:25:44.921
Those jerks...

00:25:45.046 --> 00:25:46.673
This isn't our first time.

00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:48.775
They said it wasn't
their first time burying people.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.386
The only difference is whether
they did it with cement or soil.

00:25:51.553 --> 00:25:53.096
We just need to find the hole.

00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:56.349
Okay. Get some rest first.

00:25:56.474 --> 00:25:57.851
- She's going in.
- Okay.

00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:05.692
Does that mean Park Chan-hyuk is
in one of those holes?

00:26:09.362 --> 00:26:12.616
But the thing is, we can't keep it
a secret from our boss.

00:26:14.993 --> 00:26:16.286
Why there?

00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:18.580
I'm not sure
if it was a coincidence.

00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:21.917
The thing is, the prosecutor who
got hurt saw the boys' faces.

00:26:22.042 --> 00:26:23.418
I can't get ahold of them.

00:26:23.543 --> 00:26:24.836
If the prosecutor got hurt,

00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:26.980
they must've taken off
because it was out of control.

00:26:27.005 --> 00:26:28.131
Find them now!

00:26:28.256 --> 00:26:30.508
Get rid of them
as soon as you find them.

00:26:30.634 --> 00:26:32.427
And what's her face?

00:26:32.552 --> 00:26:34.237
The prosecutor who came after me
with the construction worker.

00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:35.388
You mean Kim Ji-hee?

00:26:36.139 --> 00:26:37.474
I'm not sure if that was her.

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:39.643
What do you mean?
She showed up there.

00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:41.019
How can this be a coincidence?

00:26:41.061 --> 00:26:42.687
How!

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:44.230
Sir, then

00:26:45.273 --> 00:26:46.316
should I move it?

00:27:02.832 --> 00:27:05.335
Do you have to leave
the hospital now?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.128
Just get some rest for a few days.

00:27:07.837 --> 00:27:10.131
I need to show this
to get the warrant at least.

00:27:10.256 --> 00:27:11.383
What warrant?

00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:13.760
Search warrant for violence.

00:27:13.885 --> 00:27:14.928
- Hey...
- Here you are.

00:27:15.053 --> 00:27:16.721
Thank you.
Hey, how can you get a warrant

00:27:16.888 --> 00:27:17.947
Hey, how can you get a warrant

00:27:17.973 --> 00:27:19.324
when you went in there
on your own?

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:20.909
So why did you miss them
right under your nose?

00:27:20.934 --> 00:27:22.560
I even bought time for you.

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:23.728
Hey, I didn't miss them.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.648
You should've tried.
They were already far gone.

00:27:26.773 --> 00:27:28.274
We should've made plans.

00:27:28.817 --> 00:27:31.277
There is no planning in running.

00:27:31.403 --> 00:27:32.278
Who measures it before running?

00:27:32.404 --> 00:27:34.531
To find the body like that
in such a vast place.

00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:37.784
We only alerted Nam Wan-seong.

00:27:39.077 --> 00:27:40.453
There was no alternative.

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:43.540
I'm not blaming you.
I was there too.

00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:45.291
Still, it wasn't all for nothing.

00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:47.711
There must've been a body.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.339
Exactly.
How are we going to find it?

00:27:53.758 --> 00:27:54.801
Oh.

00:27:57.637 --> 00:27:59.848
- The metal detector.
- What?

00:28:00.849 --> 00:28:02.976
A body was found
with a metal detector before.

00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:05.562
Because the weapon was buried too.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.023
Oh.

00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:18.199
The workers might know.

00:28:19.117 --> 00:28:20.952
The chief construction worker
or the captain.

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:24.247
Something must've changed
compared to what they've done.

00:28:24.372 --> 00:28:25.665
Like soil being turned over.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.833
Right.

00:28:28.168 --> 00:28:29.502
Ask them if it's not strange

00:28:29.627 --> 00:28:31.146
for a man who reported
their boss to disappear

00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:33.214
without a trace overnight.

00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:34.049
Exactly.

00:28:34.174 --> 00:28:35.842
The workers there aren't the same.

00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:37.177
- What?
- What do you mean?

00:28:37.302 --> 00:28:39.721
Ehong blamed the construction cost
to its subcontractor

00:28:39.846 --> 00:28:41.306
and replaced it.

00:28:42.223 --> 00:28:44.684
What about that? The pyramid.

00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:46.686
- The pyramid?
- Yes, the X-ray

00:28:46.811 --> 00:28:49.814
that lets you scan the pyramid
and find the mummy.

00:28:49.939 --> 00:28:52.901
How big does it have to be
to scan the pyramid?

00:28:53.026 --> 00:28:54.544
Will that even get inside
the construction site?

00:28:54.569 --> 00:28:57.530
But you can still find the mummy

00:28:57.655 --> 00:28:58.923
without drilling
the wall or a pipe.

00:28:58.948 --> 00:29:00.658
What was that again
in mummies or bodies?

00:29:00.784 --> 00:29:02.118
Muon detector.

00:29:02.243 --> 00:29:03.078
What?
It doesn't detect a mummy

00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:04.913
It doesn't detect a mummy

00:29:05.038 --> 00:29:07.540
but a space inside the pyramid.

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:10.710
But if they poured cement
or soil...

00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:13.713
It's unlikely that there's
any empty space around the body.

00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:20.720
Our only hope now is

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.473
our boss.

00:29:45.703 --> 00:29:46.746
Come on.

00:29:57.423 --> 00:30:00.426
Did you make sure to bury the
broken porcelain, Attorney Joo?

00:30:03.012 --> 00:30:04.430
Not yet. The land is still frozen.

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:07.642
You should've made the guys
from yesterday do it.

00:30:08.351 --> 00:30:10.395
What do you mean
by the guys from yesterday?

00:30:10.895 --> 00:30:12.313
The ones that took Park Chan-hyuk.

00:30:12.605 --> 00:30:14.899
Who's Park Chan-hyuk?

00:30:17.944 --> 00:30:20.655
I don't believe

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.492
you went out of your way
to suggest it first.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.078
I've been investigating.

00:30:27.537 --> 00:30:28.621
You already know, right?

00:30:28.746 --> 00:30:31.958
One of my co-workers was attacked
by Nam's henchmen yesterday.

00:30:33.793 --> 00:30:35.587
That made it clear.

00:30:35.712 --> 00:30:38.798
That's how you and I got to

00:30:38.923 --> 00:30:40.967
talk for this long.

00:30:42.927 --> 00:30:45.430
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:46.890
Where's Park Chan-hyuk?

00:30:47.015 --> 00:30:49.017
Who on earth is that?

00:30:51.603 --> 00:30:55.106
Nam Wan-seong is worse
than you think.

00:30:55.231 --> 00:30:57.859
Don't get yourself burned
by staying next to him.

00:30:58.193 --> 00:31:00.778
Jump out before the boat sinks.

00:31:03.281 --> 00:31:04.324
Prosecutor Jo.

00:31:05.116 --> 00:31:06.743
Who's Park Chan-hyuk?

00:31:08.536 --> 00:31:10.079
You need to get something to eat.

00:31:17.879 --> 00:31:18.963
What?

00:31:19.672 --> 00:31:21.090
My bad.

00:31:21.216 --> 00:31:23.092
The materials kept disappearing
in the site,

00:31:23.218 --> 00:31:24.886
so I told them to stand guard.

00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:26.596
I didn't expect this to happen.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.932
They must've panicked
and gone off the grid.

00:31:29.057 --> 00:31:31.768
I swear I'll find them
and send them here.

00:31:32.518 --> 00:31:35.563
Captain Im, summon Nam Wan-seong.

00:31:35.688 --> 00:31:38.524
The thugs' fingerprints from
the construction site are on this.

00:31:44.864 --> 00:31:46.449
(Criminal Record, Lee Dong-cheol)

00:31:50.912 --> 00:31:53.957
Oh, no. He was an ex-convict.
He won't show up then.

00:31:54.082 --> 00:31:56.417
You'll have to get him.

00:31:57.085 --> 00:31:59.479
Why did you have your bodyguards
watch the construction site

00:31:59.504 --> 00:32:00.922
instead of construction workers?

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:03.675
He's not my bodyguard.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.842
Your henchman?

00:32:09.097 --> 00:32:11.557
Stop smiling and answer me.

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:21.651
Nam Wan-seong,
you hurt a prosecutor.

00:32:23.236 --> 00:32:24.821
You won't be able to
escape from this.

00:32:28.783 --> 00:32:30.201
I'm here to turn myself in.

00:32:31.828 --> 00:32:33.496
I'm Park Chan-hyuk.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.333
I'm the one who spread Purple
in Cheongju.

00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:43.089
I received it and gave it
to the sellers.

00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:45.508
To Im Yu-ri.

00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:48.136
Hey! Stop your bullcrap.

00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:52.265
You seem busy.
I'll leave you alone now.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.433
Sit down.

00:32:53.516 --> 00:32:54.726
Im Yu-ri

00:32:55.268 --> 00:32:57.061
stole it.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.896
I'm sorry.

00:33:01.816 --> 00:33:02.859
Hey.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.486
This isn't your only charge.

00:33:05.611 --> 00:33:06.904
You're also guilty of bribery.

00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:08.948
Oh, that?

00:33:09.782 --> 00:33:11.826
I'll send my attorney. One second.

00:33:31.054 --> 00:33:33.681
What? Wait, wait.
What was that again?

00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:40.772
Yes.

00:33:46.486 --> 00:33:48.821
Okay. Got it.

00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:50.990
Have a good day.

00:34:02.126 --> 00:34:04.754
You thought I came here
unprepared?

00:34:09.592 --> 00:34:11.886
Sir, are you out?

00:34:13.388 --> 00:34:15.848
- Schedule for a visit.
- A visit? What visit?

00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:17.100
The dollar diner.

00:34:17.225 --> 00:34:19.060
Get him to sign it
before the ribbon cutting.

00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:22.688
Tell him I, CEO Nam Wan-seong,

00:34:22.814 --> 00:34:24.941
ruined Seo Dong-jae's life
big time

00:34:25.066 --> 00:34:26.984
nothing like
how his life is ruined.

00:34:27.652 --> 00:34:30.947
What's left for Seo is going down,

00:34:31.072 --> 00:34:33.174
so he better sign the real estate
purchase agreement.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.992
It's his last chance.

00:34:35.118 --> 00:34:36.911
Yes, sir.

00:34:38.788 --> 00:34:39.914
Shoot.

00:34:48.756 --> 00:34:51.008
Using the boss doesn't feel right.

00:34:51.134 --> 00:34:52.802
She won't be taken advantage

00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:54.679
as long as she doesn't spill it
to CEO Nam.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.264
Although I prefer she does.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.266
Tell her that the body is there
for sure,

00:34:58.391 --> 00:34:59.475
and we know it.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.894
And the boss spills that
to CEO Nam.

00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:03.688
CEO Nam moves the body.

00:35:03.813 --> 00:35:06.399
It's the fastest way
to make him dig it himself.

00:35:10.278 --> 00:35:12.530
Did you apply for the construction
site search warrant?

00:35:13.114 --> 00:35:14.198
Yes.

00:35:14.323 --> 00:35:15.450
So?

00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:16.617
It was rejected.

00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:20.705
What achievement have you made
for summoning the lawyer?

00:35:21.873 --> 00:35:24.584
Well, Park Chan-hyuk suddenly
appeared out of nowhere

00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:27.336
and said Im Yu-ri sold it
and Nam Gyeo-rye knows nothing.

00:35:27.462 --> 00:35:30.173
If he was going to turn himself
in, he should've come to me.

00:35:30.298 --> 00:35:32.008
Why do you think he went there?

00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:33.885
Now you change the order?

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.237
You didn't summon the lawyer
because Park Chan-hyuk showed up,

00:35:36.262 --> 00:35:38.489
but because you summoned him,
Park Chan-hyuk showed up.

00:35:38.514 --> 00:35:40.183
So you let him go
without any gain?

00:35:40.683 --> 00:35:42.059
That's true...

00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:44.979
I'm sorry.

00:35:45.104 --> 00:35:46.272
No need to apologize.

00:35:47.231 --> 00:35:48.399
I won't accept your apology.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.736
Empty your room for Sung Si-woon.

00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:57.533
If you've taught him well,
he should be able to take over.

00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:01.662
I don't know if he learned
anything from there.

00:36:04.499 --> 00:36:05.541
Yes.

00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:06.626
Get out, all of you.

00:36:16.511 --> 00:36:18.513
I don't know
what she's going to do.

00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:20.723
Judging by what she said,
I can't tell.

00:36:42.954 --> 00:36:44.205
Do you have something to say?

00:36:46.624 --> 00:36:47.667
Come in.

00:36:54.048 --> 00:36:57.343
I heard Park Chan-hyuk
turned himself in.

00:37:00.346 --> 00:37:01.806
About the suspension
of prosecution.

00:37:03.224 --> 00:37:04.559
Because the witness disappeared.

00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:08.521
Yes, you wrote the report, right?

00:37:09.272 --> 00:37:10.314
Yes.

00:37:11.439 --> 00:37:13.733
Is that why you went to
the construction site yesterday?

00:37:16.695 --> 00:37:17.822
Yes.

00:37:17.947 --> 00:37:20.241
Park Chan-hyuk suddenly
turned himself in

00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:21.742
because he was scared.

00:37:21.866 --> 00:37:24.245
Seeing what happened
to his brother-in-law and...

00:37:27.832 --> 00:37:29.708
And my daughter
who worked with him.

00:37:31.168 --> 00:37:32.253
That's bullcrap.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.381
What could possibly happen to him
when the perpetrator is caught?

00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:38.342
Couldn't he put more effort
into his excuse?

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.554
Do you think
it's in the construction site?

00:37:43.973 --> 00:37:45.391
Is it Nam Wan-seong's doing?

00:37:48.102 --> 00:37:50.855
To wish the safety

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.622
of Seowon-gu industrial
complex redevelopment,

00:37:52.647 --> 00:37:56.068
we will now shovel the first spade
to announce its beginning.

00:37:58.446 --> 00:38:00.006
Cheongju industrial area
redevelopment plan

00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:02.325
that was full of rumors

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.659
is on the rise
after selecting the contractor

00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:06.996
and finally shoveled
its first spade today.

00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:10.291
However, recently, many issues
arose regarding Ehong Construction

00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:12.001
that became a contractor...

00:38:12.126 --> 00:38:15.713
Sector A written in the brochure

00:38:15.838 --> 00:38:17.590
is over there.

00:38:18.173 --> 00:38:21.802
An apartment complex same as
the most expensive one in Seoul

00:38:21.927 --> 00:38:23.403
will be built there.
It'll draw a floating population

00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:25.723
to Cheongju like never before.

00:38:26.432 --> 00:38:28.351
Section B is that way.

00:38:28.476 --> 00:38:31.979
What we're focusing on
is Section A.

00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:33.731
This way.

00:38:56.252 --> 00:38:57.338
He didn't hear any sound,

00:38:57.463 --> 00:38:59.715
but when he returned
after cleaning, the door was open.

00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:15.831
Considering the time they were
caught in the surveillance camera,

00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:17.441
they must've come here

00:39:17.566 --> 00:39:19.752
after hurting the prosecutor
in the construction site.

00:39:19.777 --> 00:39:20.820
Did you report it?

00:39:21.404 --> 00:39:23.447
No, neither did the manager.

00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:29.286
How dare they prepare
the escape fund with my money?

00:39:30.204 --> 00:39:33.332
Find them
and bring just one to me.

00:39:33.958 --> 00:39:35.000
Who...
Anyone!

00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:36.252
Anyone!

00:40:11.454 --> 00:40:12.747
I've read your testimony.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.623
You recited it nicely.

00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:15.999
Did CEO Nam order you?

00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:25.425
What the hell is that?

00:40:27.261 --> 00:40:28.721
Were you tortured?

00:40:30.055 --> 00:40:31.098
Say it.

00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:38.689
Hey, I got your back.

00:40:39.607 --> 00:40:41.317
If you stay like this,

00:40:41.442 --> 00:40:42.359
now that Choi Geum-ho's dead,

00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:44.570
you'll have to take
all the blame, you know?

00:40:53.662 --> 00:40:55.790
What the hell did they do to you?

00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:59.460
What's gotten into you?
Hey, Park Chan-hyuk.

00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:01.504
Chan-hyuk.

00:41:21.982 --> 00:41:24.527
Do you think
it's in the construction site too?

00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:27.196
To be honest,

00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:29.281
there are no other options.

00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:31.826
I feel bad for the witness,

00:41:31.951 --> 00:41:34.036
but unless he's alive somewhere,

00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.832
we won't have hope unless it was
done in the construction site.

00:41:45.005 --> 00:41:46.674
This was a rent fraud.

00:41:46.799 --> 00:41:48.509
So it was first sent to
the 9th floor.

00:41:48.634 --> 00:41:50.177
Then it was transferred to us

00:41:50.302 --> 00:41:51.862
after the victim assaulted
the perpetrator.

00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:53.447
Do you know Prosecutor Park
on the 9th floor?

00:41:53.472 --> 00:41:55.031
You mean Prosecutor
Park Woon-jung? Yes.

00:41:55.056 --> 00:41:57.768
If you have questions,
ask Prosecutor Park.

00:41:57.893 --> 00:41:59.728
And whether to extenuate
the situation.

00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.567
I know it's chaotic to take over
my cases all of a sudden.

00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:08.320
The assignments you had
because you were a newbie

00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:10.906
like giving tours, talk to
the boss about distributing them.

00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:13.367
And...

00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:17.162
You can always rely
on the investigators for the rest.

00:42:19.874 --> 00:42:22.376
- Thank you in advance.
- Oh, no.

00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:24.545
We'll do our best to help you.

00:42:32.261 --> 00:42:34.178
Good luck, Prosecutor Sung.

00:42:34.972 --> 00:42:37.600
You got this because I...

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.285
Let me get some rest now.

00:43:00.372 --> 00:43:02.332
Thank you for all your work.

00:43:02.832 --> 00:43:04.251
Thank you for everything.

00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:06.754
You never know.

00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:09.548
If it turns out well,
you can always come back.

00:43:09.673 --> 00:43:12.176
Well, I'll leave it
to Prosecutor Sung now.

00:43:12.968 --> 00:43:14.344
Good luck, okay?

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.238
I'm not sure what your first
assignment is going to be yet.

00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:17.848
Oh, that is...

00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:22.186
It's begun.

00:43:22.853 --> 00:43:23.896
What?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.047
Wait. Won-cheol.

00:43:50.172 --> 00:43:52.382
