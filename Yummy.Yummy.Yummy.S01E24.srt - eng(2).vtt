00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.300
(Yunlai Tavern)

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.780
Taverns used to open on the 10th day,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.800
but Shen's Diner opened on the 6th,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.190
even imitating the imperial dishes

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.070
like

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.550
Little Spring Platter.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.430
Warm spring water

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.600
is rare at this time of year.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.240
At the beginning of spring,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.160
only the homes of nobles

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.430
can draw on hot spring water

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.870
to grow some fruits and vegetables.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.590
They can let their guests

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.360
enjoy melons and vegetables now.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.200
That's quite an accomplishment.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.750
But they're not using hot spring water.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.150
They've leased the land

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.240
and used oil paper and bamboo to create

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.830
a temperature-controlled frame.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.270
They call it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.200
greenhouse cultivation.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.970
They even taught this trick

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.340
to the farmers around the Capital

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.430
and fooled them

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.990
into waiving rent

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.240
and supplying them with vegetables.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.200
Today, we're here to congratulate them.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.550
Why are you being so petty?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.200
Sorry.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.080
Why so nervous?

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.080
This place is bustling with people.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.200
If you make people think

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.150
that I usually mistreat my servants,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.750
I'll have you killed.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.680
I understand.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.040
I understand.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.960
(Shen's Diner)

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.200
- Welcome.
- Lady Shen.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.200
On behalf of Yunlai Tavern,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.830
I'm here to congratulate you

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.920
on the Chinese New Year
and the renovation.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.080
(This is the arch-rival from Yunlai.)

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.590
(A typical villainous,
refined male antagonist.)

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.800
So, you are the owner of Yunlai Tavern,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.030
Mr. Lu Yun.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.080
How thoughtful.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.310
Please come in and have a seat.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.680
You must be busy.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.550
When you have time,

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.830
I'll come again for a cup of tea.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.120
Only you will have time for this.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.240
Every time I see it, I'm repulsed.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.710
What's wrong with the people here?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.650
Everything new

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.980
ends up warding off evil.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.400
Welcome.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.350
You can eat at Yunlai Tavern anytime,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.990
but if we miss
the Little Spring Platter,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.170
it won't be available anymore.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.010
Let's go.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.830
How about

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.920
you ask Noble Consort Dou

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.620
to find a way to deal with them?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
Lin Yan rose to power

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.280
after dealing with her relatives.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.040
He's backing Shen's Diner.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.440
Yet, he's won the favor
of Chancellor Meng

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.830
thanks to the Appeal drum.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.960
Chancellor Meng

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.040
is planning to marry
his granddaughter to him.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.480
Lin Yan will eventually distance himself
from his cousin.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.980
(Shi'an County)

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.390
Young Master,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.230
this is the place.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.560
Young Master.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.190
Sorry,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.070
sir.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.320
It's alright.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.600
Lady Zheng, you're pregnant.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.750
Please be careful.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.070
How did you know I'm a Zheng?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.190
I am Liu Chang,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.510
a deputy in the Prefecture,

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.360
sent to investigate
the Magistrate of Shi'an.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.480
I'm Cheng Hu, a deputy

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.120
in the Prefecture.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.840
You're here for the Magistrate?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.240
I have so much to say.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.360
The magistrate is truly kind.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.200
Come in for some tea.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.680
Thank you.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760
Please.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.550
Please sit here first.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.720
I'll go prepare the tea.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.990
The tea here is wonderful,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
fragrant and rich,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.390
refreshing

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.360
to the heart and soul,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.200
sweet and lingering.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.910
Have your seat.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.430
She's so talkative.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.360
I didn't expect it.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.840
When I came before,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.750
I just asked around the neighborhood,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.390
but I didn't see her in person.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.320
If you want to know
about the Magistrate,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.240
ask me.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080
The Magistrate

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.040
is a truly good man.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.280
One of a kind in the world.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.390
He's handsome, gentle,
considerate, and upright.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.950
His only hobby is

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.050
advocating for the people.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.150
Thank you.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.680
No need to trouble yourself.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.870
These are not for us?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.030
Sorry.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.240
I'm pregnant

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.180
and get hungry easily.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.560
Help yourselves.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.280
Thank you.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.280
Not for me.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.950
Try some. A local specialty.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.790
How is it?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.190
Is this water shield pastry?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.360
The water shield in Shi'an
and Qingyang grows very well.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.240
Not long ago,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.390
someone even came all the way

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.170
from Yong'an to pick some.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.840
These water shields

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.040
were given by Lady Shen,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.680
who came to pick water shields.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.510
She was covered in injuries that day.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.310
I thought something had happened,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.800
but it turned out she got hurt
picking these water shields.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.190
She must've craved this

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.480
so much

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.600
as to go to such lengths.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.870
Do you also like this?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.280
I thought only people
from Qingyang loved it.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.280
People from Qingyang?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.840
Are you perhaps

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.680
from Qingyang?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.280
When I was a child,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.430
I was engaged in Qingyang,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.750
but that family got into trouble,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.430
and the whole clan perished.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.160
Fearing entanglement,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.190
my family moved to Shi'an

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.870
and never dared to go back.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.560
Unexpectedly,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.310
last September,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.600
someone went to my relatives in Qingyang

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.920
to ask about that engagement.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.990
I'm only telling you this

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.800
because you are from the Prefecture.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.270
If that family back then
had a grievance,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.960
could you two perhaps help?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.150
We'd certainly not stand idly by.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.120
But please tell us

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.870
what was

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.320
asked about

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.600
last September.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160
It was...

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.670
I don't want to say.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.720
- Well.
- The officialdom is complex.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.840
I don't know which side you are on.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.190
How could I just say these things?

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.630
Well.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.350
In that case,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.200
thank you for the pastries and tea.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800
Goodbye.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.990
Young Master.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
Wait.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.630
I said all that just now

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.390
to make you two anxious.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.600
When people get anxious,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.960
they reveal their true character.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.390
If you had threatened me just now,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.960
then I wouldn't say

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.990
anything at all.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.960
You're all alone.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.720
How bold of you.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.270
The Magistrate here

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.630
is my husband.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.670
In Shi'an County,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.390
I don't have much to fear.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.560
The Magistrate?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.720
But your house...

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.390
It's a bit modest.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.440
My husband only wants
to serve the people.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.200
He's earned a good reputation.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.670
You claimed to be here
for the Magistrate,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.240
yet you didn't know my identity.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.840
What you want to know

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.440
must be the old case, right?

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.870
Exactly.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.630
I am Lin Yan,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.420
Vice Prefecture of the Prefecture,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.720
investigating the Qingyang Cui case.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.990
My husband and I both believe

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.080
that the Prefect

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.270
could never have done that.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.840
In the ninth month,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.560
a man approached my great-uncle,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.440
inquiring about the Cui
and Zheng marriage.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.270
My great-uncle was wary

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.480
and saw through his false name,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.720
so he brushed him off.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.080
I asked my husband
to find out who that man is,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.160
and he turned out

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.270
to be the fourth son of Prince Zhao,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.400
Li Ang.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.240
If I remember correctly,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.320
you handled

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.440
Magistrate Dou's embezzlement case.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.560
Yes.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.670
Actually, my husband

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.720
has been keeping an eye
on this case as well.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.390
Magistrate Dou is related
to Noble Consort Dou,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.910
and the money he embezzled

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.390
all flowed back to the Dou family.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.190
Prince Zhao appears to be on bad terms
with Noble Consort Dou,

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.200
but in private,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.910
he's been in contact
with the Dou family.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.870
He's been dealing with the Capital,

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.990
and he's concerned with the Cui case.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.870
So, these two cases might be

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.990
the same one.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.670
Mr. Lin,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.030
Uncle Cui was too upright

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.200
to sell official positions.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.030
Please investigate

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.870
this old case.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.620
(Shen's Diner)

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.710
Young Master,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.320
we're passing by Shen's Diner.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.510
Shall we

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.320
go in?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.440
No.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.910
Go to the Prefecture.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.240
Your Carefree Drink.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.150
Enjoy.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.360
Mr. Lin.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.080
- Wait.
- Father.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.790
- Uncle.
- Wait.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.110
Wait.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.630
Mr. Lin,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.510
we've just launched

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.960
the Little Spring Platter.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.990
I was thinking of sending some over,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.440
and here you are.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.280
What a coincidence.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.200
Why don't you take some

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.240
to try at home?

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.670
Deyuan, a Little Spring Platter.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.560
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.910
Mr. Lin is here.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.920
No need.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.710
Liu Chang.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.560
Stop, stop.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.990
Sorry, please stop.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.590
Mr. Lin,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.670
when we make something delicious,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.420
we always want to share it
with our family.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.870
Why don't you

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.870
give it a try?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.870
Yes, give it a try.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.030
Coming.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.710
Well.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.560
Milady, it's ready.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.560
Please, accept it.

Mr. Lin,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.560
you're already here.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.150
Why not come in and sit?

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.590
Yes.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.270
What a coincidence.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560
And everyone

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.440
in the family really misses you.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.960
We don't know

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.630
how you've been lately.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.360
Family?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.080
Let's go.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.260
(Upright in Speech and Conduct)

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.200
The Shen family is so detestable.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.770
They should be bad through and through.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.080
Why be so nice to us?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.480
We can't even

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.320
be mad at them now,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.200
and yet,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.040
we can't help but be.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.240
Some things

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.080
can't be faked

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.560
or be real.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.280
Mr. Lin.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.780
Chancellor Meng is here.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.440
Mr. Meng.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.440
Please.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.200
No need to panic.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.240
It's not a big deal.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.440
I want to discuss

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.390
a marriage proposal with you.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.600
You must be joking.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.030
I'm not joking at all.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.720
You know,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.390
my granddaughter, Jingwen,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.870
is picky

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.200
and has her own ideas,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.480
but every time she talks

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.790
about you at home,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.630
she speaks highly of you.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.240
I've only

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.960
met her twice.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.630
How could it be so serious?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.480
Just two meetings,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.120
and you can't forget her?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.480
Mr. Lin,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.560
it's time to settle down.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.110
No, no.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.050
Supervisory officials are not allowed

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.530
to marry women under their jurisdiction.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.840
I'm an official in the Capital;

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.520
I can't marry a lady here.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.840
I'm not a match for Lady Shen.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.230
The law is not without compassion.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.950
I'll ask His Majesty for a favor.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.760
I don't think it will be hard.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.260
(Capital Prefecture)

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.140
(Mindful and Perceptive)

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.990
Young Master.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.270
Young Master.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.150
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.230
Lady Shen.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.910
I heard from Grandfather

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.150
that you didn't refuse.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.360
No.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.470
That's not what I meant.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.490
- Well.
- Please don't misunderstand.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.800
I know.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.080
If you'd agreed to the marriage,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.470
you wouldn't have given

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.040
such an ambiguous answer.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.320
Grandfather is always like this.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.840
He cares for me

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.900
and wants me to be happy,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.120
but he always forgets

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.470
to ask me

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.520
what my true wishes are.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.780
(Jicai)

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.020
No wonder.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.060
Grandfather said

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.200
that your concern is

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.960
that supervisory officials
are not allowed

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.800
to marry women under their jurisdiction.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.500
Isn't Jicai also a woman

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.540
under your jurisdiction?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.940
Actually,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.900
I had thought of this.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.500
To ask His Majesty for a favor

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.820
should not be hard.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.700
I understand

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.380
your intentions.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:53.940
I'm sorry,

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.140
but in my opinion,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.940
you wouldn't want

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.740
to waste your time on me.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.740
I was hoping you'd agree.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.820
With your looks and talents,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.860
my life won't be too hard.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.860
Still, this is just a choice,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.780
not a wish fulfilled.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.980
If it were up to me,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.300
I'd rather not be pushed

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.980
into getting married.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.100
I understand.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.260
Now that everything is out in the open,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.400
I'll take my leave.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.540
Since I've said I won't force you,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.980
I'll keep my word.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.260
You can rest easy.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.180
I just wonder if you

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.140
could do me a favor.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.900
What is it?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.060
My grandfather has been

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.620
eagerly arranging things for me lately,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.260
which is hard to deal with.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.620
If you could

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.540
wait a bit longer before refusing him,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.500
then I could use this time

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.380
to handle this properly.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.820
So,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.300
I'll have to trouble you for a while.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.140
Is that okay?

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.300
It's fine.

Yangyang is missing.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.100
I've searched everywhere,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.980
but I can't find her.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.740
- How could that be?
- How would I know?

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.020
She was just doing her homework.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.020
I checked, but she wasn't in the room.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.300
Hongwen Academy. Let's go.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.460
- Let's go.
- It's a day off.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.980
The mentors aren't there.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.860
What should we do?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.860
Report it.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.820
Yes, let's do that.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.940
- Yes.
- Right.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.700
I'm telling you to go.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.940
We should go together.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.060
I can't explain clearly.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.180
Let's go, let's go.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.380
Stay in the diner.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.220
Okay.

- Mr. Liu.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.540
- Mr. Liu.
- Help us.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.060
It's an emergency.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.640
- What's wrong?
- Yangyang is missing.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.660
Mr. Liu,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.900
we did deceive Mr. Lin,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.940
but please help us find Yangyang.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.860
Don't worry.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.820
Yangyang

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.180
is inside.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.340
She came early to ask about her lessons.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.580
She just told us she didn't inform you.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.020
To prevent you from worrying,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.960
my young master sent me

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.940
to let you know.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.660
I just happened to run into you here.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.140
I was so scared.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.300
That's such a relief.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.740
(Zhi)

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.580
Zhi?

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.620
Zhi has two parts, meaning peace.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.860
Biography of Sima Xiangru says,

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.140
"When all share peace,
it means common prosperity."

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.580
You've read this sentence

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.780
in the Book of Han?

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.540
Explain it.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.100
This sentence means

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.520
that when everyone is doing well,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.360
it's all good.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.140
Guests from the Western Regions
often come.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.380
This sentence

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.420
is very useful
in receiving foreign envoys.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.860
To establish a nation,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.420
one must display power

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.140
and ensure peace at home and abroad,

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.200
valuing harmony above all.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.920
This is similar to doing business.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.630
Auntie once said something like this.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.240
Different sides
have different interests,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.680
and one should try to negotiate,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.740
consider the other party's perspective,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.620
follow their line of thinking,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.220
address their concerns,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.740
and then introduce one's own hopes

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.020
to achieve balance.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.020
Auntie!

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.740
Grandpa! Grandma!

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.660
Did I answer well?

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.500
I'm amazing, right?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.500
Amazing.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.860
What's more amazing is

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.800
that you ran out

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.380
without telling your family.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.500
Yes, if you do this again,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.300
I'll spank you.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.940
I made a promise with Dad

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.300
to improve myself before we meet,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.860
so I have to study hard.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.490
But mentors can't explain
some questions,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.260
so I came to ask Mr. Lin.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.740
Uncle Liu Chang,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.220
Mr. Lin hasn't been

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.860
to our diner after the Chinese New Year,

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.900
and he seemed strange today.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.360
Did he have a falling out

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360
with my family?

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.060
You're too young

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.100
to worry about that.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.580
It's none of your business.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.860
Now that everyone is together,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.860
does that mean we're all good now?

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.060
Eat your walnut.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.100
Stop asking so many questions.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.660
Mr. Lin,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.580
Yangyang is still young,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.980
so we didn't tell her

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.100
about some things.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.500
We didn't expect her to trouble you.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.580
We're really sorry.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.100
Yangyang is fine.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.900
But I've been too busy with work

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.820
to entertain outsiders.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.340
Please take care.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.900
We've caused so much trouble;

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.900
you shouldn't have had to bear them.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.980
It's all because I lied to you.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.540
I'm really sorry.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.500
Let bygones

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.500
be bygones.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.260
We were wrong

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.420
about this.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.580
It's only right
that you don't forgive us.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.180
But if we don't even apologize,

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.740
then we'll owe you

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.180
even more.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.020
Yes, yes.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.140
Mr. Lin, rest assured.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.460
It won't happen next time.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.980
Alright.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.180
Take that as I've accepted your apology.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.460
I still have to work.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.100
Mr. Lin,

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.540
my father said
it won't happen next time,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.660
but there probably won't be a next time.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.260
May you be well in the future.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.300
If there's anything you need help
with in the case,

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.940
please let us know.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.660
We're always ready.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.580
Always.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.820
Fengxia,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.780
you often complain

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.400
that I don't help you
handle ingredients.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.420
Starting today,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.660
I can handle ingredients

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.510
and cook the dishes.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520
You don't have to do it.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.360
Just rest.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.300
Rest.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.940
Listen to me.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.260
No need to do that.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.020
These days,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.740
to others,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.780
we seem quite normal

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.180
and even loving.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.580
But only I know

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.340
we're still awkward.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.220
You don't even wear the ring I bought.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.300
Why?

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.900
I don't feel like it.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.100
If so, don't wear it.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.620
When you feel like it,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.460
then you can wear it.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.860
Look.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.980
Listen.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.620
I haven't peeled a radish for so long,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.820
but my technique is not rusty at all.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.660
See?

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.140
I'm an experienced chef.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.680
I can still cut like this.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.740
It's broken!

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.580
Broken!

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.780
So what?

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:45.980
Without a piece,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.580
you'll lose some weight.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.660
Fengxia,

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.220
I'm bleeding a lot.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.860
I'm losing too much blood.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.140
I'm seeing double when I look at you.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.300
Fengxia, help me.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.780
Why are you so indifferent?

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.220
I'm bleeding here.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.780
What's the big deal?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.340
I cut myself all the time

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.900
when I'm chopping vegetables.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.660
I've bled more than you.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.900
Have I ever complained
in all these years?

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.300
Just suck on your hand.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.540
It'll help with iron deficiency.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.580
What's the matter?

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.180
Will you ever forgive me?

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.060
Do we have to live like this forever?

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.260
Mr. Lin's shop

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.540
has the most novel jewelry.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.700
(Fuyun Tavern)
That's true.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.580
Let's go take a look.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.690
They're all quite nice.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.560
- Let's go.
- Sir.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.740
- Come in.
- Let's go.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.180
Why stare at me?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.060
Your staring

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.900
won't change

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.100
a thing.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.660
I have to say it.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.860
Isn't it so?

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.940
Don't I treat you well enough?

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.460
What else do you want me to do?

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.820
I've bought you so many things.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.460
Why aren't you happy?

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.060
What do I have to do to make you happy?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.300
You won't say, will you?

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.140
That means you're in the wrong.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.980
Fengxia,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.340
you're in the wrong.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.620
There are no customers in the diner.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.940
What are you two so busy with?

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.880
We're packing spring platters.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.740
A customer came
for a spring platter just now,

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.500
but he said he was too busy to wait,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.460
so we're packing it

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.440
and delivering it to him.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.860
Good, Deyuan.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.840
You learn pretty fast.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.580
She even learned the word "pack".

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.700
This must be a packing box.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.800
Deyuan told me
there's hard yellow paper,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.750
but it's too expensive.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.540
I checked.
It's just wax molded into shape.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.440
We can do it ourselves.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.280
It's cheap,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.560
waterproof, and oil-resistant.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.900
Jicai,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.420
are you planning to deliver food?

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.660
What do you think?

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.420
You're the cleverest.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.580
Look.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.980
For those who do hard labor

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.380
and don't have time to eat,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.180
they can take packed meals with them.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.580
I heard that many people

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.300
are following our example,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.860
selling lunch and dinner.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.580
The prices are gradually coming down.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.420
Locals can now have
three healthy meals a day.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.620
Isn't that good for health?

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.620
Right?

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.260
The time-travel novels
are always like this.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.900
The protagonist's small actions

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.740
can push life forward
by leaps and bounds.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.460
Isn't that thrilling?

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.180
Yes, so thrilling.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.580
Milady,

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.020
how do you come up

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.700
with so many fresh ideas

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.140
and so many new words?

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.740
Though I don't understand them,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.340
after hearing them for a while,
I seem to get the gist.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.700
I always feel
like you're not from this time.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.060
Yes, I'm from over 1,000 years
in the future.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.060
You're joking again.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.060
You just don't believe me.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.340
- Done.
- It's done?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.420
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.260
Bye.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.420
Wait, wait.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.140
Deyuan, let me see.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.280
Lift your hand. Let me see.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.180
Look.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.020
You've got sauce all over you.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.220
Look at yourself.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.940
Your clothes are dirty, too.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.620
You're like two little kittens.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.780
Alright. I'll go deliver it.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.820
If others see you like this,

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.540
they might think our food isn't clean.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.540
Alright, I'll go.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.140
Oh, where is this being delivered?

The tavern next to Ruyue Shop.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.500
Alright, I got it.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.980
Fengxia.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.180
You're here.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.220
No, who are you?

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.220
Who are you?

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.180
Sir, why are you running?

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.020
Don't, don't.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.900
No physical contact between men

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.060
- and women.
- Don't run.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.860
I'm a married man.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.100
Sir, you seem to have some money.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.380
If you were willing to spend it,

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.140
why would you be troubled by love?

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.140
I'm a man with a family.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.540
- Sir.
- Help!

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.620
Excuse me.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.020
Where is the Flowery Room?

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.900
Someone ordered
our Little Spring Platter.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.380
Please come with me.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.500
Sure.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.700
This is the room.

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.020
Thank you.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:22.900
Sir.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.300
Something's wrong.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.140
You can't do this.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.620
Help!

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.460
Help...

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.740
You...

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.620
Who is this?

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.620
Fengxia,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.900
I didn't do anything.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.540
I don't know them.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.020
I was just sitting here.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.260
I didn't even drink wine.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.600
If you don't believe me, smell me.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.340
Shen Jianshe,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.100
you've really made it.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.260
No...

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.180
Just drinking with him is no fun.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.820
Ladies,

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.140
pour some wine.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.700
Fengxia,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.180
your temper...

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.020
Stop drinking.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.820
Miss,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.060
please bring some paper and a brush.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.300
Then you can leave.
