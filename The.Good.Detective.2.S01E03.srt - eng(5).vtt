00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.800
[Episode 3]

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.330
The student who got off at about 20:00 (8:00 pm) last night,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.350
do you remember her?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.860
This is Seongwol-dong, right?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.360
Yes, it is.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.210
Yes, I do remember.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.520
Not many people get on or off at that place,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.960
so I remember this particular student getting off on her own sometimes.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.270
Well, do you

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.930
remember someone with this backpack getting off there by any chance?

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.910
Come on. I can't remember the passengers' backpacks.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.920
Then, was there a man who got off alone before this student got off?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.980
Well, I'm not sure.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.020
Don't you think the bus' CCTV footage would be more accurate than my memory?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.600
Honestly, there's no proof that the guy with the backpack is the culprit.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.870
His backpack could have been caught on the camera coincidentally while peeing,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.350
or it could've been someone throwing up because they were drunk.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.710
Well...

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.480
Yeah, that's possible.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.420
What? Hey!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.440
Then are you insisting that the owner of the backpack is the culprit without even thinking about such things?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.240
When did I insist?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.470
You, punk! I really don't like you.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.890

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.010
What do you think? Can you smell the culprit?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.640
The culprit...

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.350
was standing here where he could see the bus stop

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.980
and was waiting for the victim to walk up.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.970
And when he saw lights from the car, he quickly hid himself by the wall.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.190
If the person is moving aside to avoid a car,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.680
they usually avoid it while looking at the car. No one avoids one with their back to it.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.960
Looks like something happened.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.010
How are we supposed to identify it from this?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.000
- This backpack is popular.
- Many people wear this kind of backpack.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600
Violent Crimes Division Team 2...
[If any driver saw a passenger with this backpack, please contact the police asap!!!]

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.840
I wonder what that person did.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.300
I can't really see, and it's black.
[Detective Oh Ji Hyeok]

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.840
You went to the crime scene with the detectives last night, right?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.300
Yes.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.790
According to the detectives, you asked to go there first.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.340
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.260
Well, what was the reason you asked to go there?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.050
That's where my granddaughter died.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.430
I wanted to go

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.260
and console her soul.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.050
But why on that day?

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.250
It was quite a while after the incident.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.320
Why suddenly?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.500
Was my granddaughter

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.320
also lying there the same way as that woman I saw?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.210
Hui Joo called me to come and see.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.500
To see how she died.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.300
To look at it clearly.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.640
Eoreusin,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.590
there may be a misunderstanding.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.780
Currently, the police think that this was done by a person other

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.890
than the culprit who murdered your granddaughter.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.060
What you just said,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.820
can you prove that?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.300
The culprit for this murder will be caught soon.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.860
That will be proof.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.850
Well,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.130
if you catch the culprit for this case,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.750
please contact me.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.390
I have so much to ask that man.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.380
Okay. You should go home for today.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.560
Thank you for your help.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.170
Okay.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.280
- Detective Park, escort him home.
- Yes, sir.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.130
N-N-No.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.760
I'm not yet such a frail old man that needs help.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.040
I'll go on my own.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.500
Team Leader,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.470
we just got mail from the NFS (National Forensic Service).

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.100
What did they say?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.020
Well...

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.680
What did they say, you bastard?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.440
With the past cases,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.640
the modus operandi was almost a one-hundred percent match.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.830
So, they've

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.580
- concluded that it's the same perpetrator.
- That's crazy.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.980
Call them,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.490
and tell them to investigate it themselves if they're going to meddle in the direction we're going.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.250
What do bastards who just cut up corpses know about crime scenes?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.370
[If any driver saw a passenger with this backpack, please contact the police asap!!!]

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.220
What is this?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.650
We checked everything,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.640
and this isn't a picture that was captured on the bus' CCTV footage.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.350
Where did this picture come from?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.350
Hey, why did you attach your business card there?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.740
- That just confuses the people who settled on the investigation direction and are moving straightforward.
- You two,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.350
you learned something on the crime scene that day, didn't you?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.630
You caught this based on that. Am I wrong? Huh?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.130
Do you think MIU has any power?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.260
Aren't you here to get information from us?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.190
- But if you pressure us threateningly, do you think we will give it to you?
- Hey!

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.040
It's not like we're here to just hang out.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.200
- We're formally requesting your cooperation with the investigation!
- Then request it via an official letter!

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.300
- If not, figure it out on your own!
- Oh, are you refusing our request for cooperation?

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.600
Don't you think that would become a problem in the future?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.400
Then we'll add a condition as well.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.570
Share the entire serial murder case record with us.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.480
Then we'll tell you the source of this photo.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.140
Do you want to catch the culprit that bad?

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.440
I'll tell you honestly.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.290
A murder was committed right in front of my eyes.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.400
I have to catch him with my own hands.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.170
If I don't, I'll be embarrassed as a detective for the rest of my life.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.530
That's the whole reason why I want to catch him.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.770
By the way,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.710
providing our case records outside our team

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.210
is difficult at the moment.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.440
We don't need the crappy case records that you guys created.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.290
Just...

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.580
don't...

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.830
interfere with our investigation.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.740
Wow, just as I thought!

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.180
What would I have done if I didn't get it done here?

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.340
By the way, what about the repair cost?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.290
You bought it because you trusted my store, so I should fix it.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.000
You can just go.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.520
Aigoo. You tell me just to go all the time. Aigoo, thank you.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.580
Thank you.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.550
Goodbye.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.890
You'll have this shop for a long time, right?

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.900
Yes. Goodbye.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.330
I'll come back.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.560
They definitely put great effort into finding it,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.580
but do you think it's the culprit?

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.490
The timing of the footage is a bit questionable too.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.190
And there's no difinitive evidence that it's the culprit's backpack.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.620
What did the guys from Incheon West say?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.100
They kept saying it is the culprit's and that they trust it is.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.870
They're right. That's the perpetrator's backpack.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.800
Focus on this for now. However, we're reducing the range of investigation.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.600
Limit it to people around the victim Park Seon Mi. Okay?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.980
Yes, sir.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.110
Excluding the Park Seon Mi case,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.510
from the first case to the fourth,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.280
the CCVT footage we found of the victims' movement is 180 hours.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.600
And the CCTV footage from around the crime scene on the day the body was found

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.500
is 98 hours. In total...

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.060
it's 278 hours of CCTV footage.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.690
Even if we watch nonstop for an entire day, how many days would that be?

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.050
- It's more than ten days.
- That's not how you should calculate it.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.610
One, two, three, four, five, six, and Dong Wook, too.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.970
Divide 278 hours by six.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.450
46 hours and 20 minutes.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.600
Wow, that's amazing, but why does he annoy me?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.590
Anyway, it wouldn't even take two days per person.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.760
- What about food?
- You can eat while watching, you little...

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.850
Isn't there a high possibility

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.730
that it's a copycat crime, like MIU is claiming?

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.500
If you use common sense, isn't it a bit strange

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.220
to leave a corpse in the same place as the last incident?

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.180
Let's just dig in and focus on Park Seon Mi's case.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.130
That's right. To look at all the cases seems a bit stupid.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.160
That's a story from the people who believe that Kim Hyeong Bok is the perpetrator,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.070
but we know that he isn't the culprit.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.390
It's something we need to investigate from the beginning.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.840
I found it.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.760
Hey.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.220
This is it, right?

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.580
Yeah, it's the same. Good job.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.510
Go through the CCTV footage and find this backpack.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.680
The culprit will come along with it.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.750
You lose if you don't play, rock, paper, scissors!

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.610
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.690
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:36.560
♫ Baby (baby). You give me real good feelings (that's alright) ♫

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.280
♫ I'm telling you, baby (baby) ♫

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.100
♫ I'm in a really good mood now (you're outasight) ♫

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.310
♫ We're gonna have a good time ♫

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.510
♫ When you're here with me, baby, sunshine ♫

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.780
♫ You just wait and see, baby, good times ♫

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:04.540
♫ When you're here with me there'll be good times, good times, yeah ♫

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.880
Let's go eat.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.660
Yes.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.930
We are here.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.300
Oh, wow.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.000
You guys must have stayed up all night.

♫ Baby (baby). You give me real good feelings (that's alright) ♫

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.450
♫ I'm telling you, baby, baby (baby) ♫

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.620
♫ I'm in a really good mood now (you're outasight). Oh yeah ♫

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.490
♫ We're gonna have a good time ♫

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.610
♫ When you're here with me, baby, sunshine ♫

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.830
♫ You just wait and see, baby, good times ♫

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.440
Here you go!

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.490
Eat a lot.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.550
Where did you move the sashimi knife

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.440
- that was here as evidence?
- Who moved it?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.940
- What?
- What sashimi knife?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.240
- Where?
- Where is it?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.340
Find it, hurry up!

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.840
This... didn't have blood on it, so...

♫ Baby (baby) ♫

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.300
Less than a week after the death of the White Gown Serial killer, who made the people tremble in fear,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.370
another murder with the same method has occurred.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.550
- Those guys.
- The police are seeing this as a copycat crime of the

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.080
- They're really good at making up stories.
- White Gown serial murders and are mobilizing all forces

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.880
to arrest the perpetrator.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.910
♫ When you're here with me, baby, sunshine ♫

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.860
Did you look into what the guys are doing?

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.490
Yes, that's... uh...

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.040
They all came to work because they had something to do or something.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.010
Why are they coming to work when they're on vacation?

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.220
Are they... again─

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.050
I will persuade them somehow and send them on vacation again.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.350
No, you don't have to do that.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.220
Just leave them be.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.450
But... I'm just concerned that they might start something and cause you trouble.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.530
They're not people who would listen to me or you.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.220
Just let them do whatever they want.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.610
Are you sure we can just leave them be?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.770
I gave up on them. Let them do whatever they want.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.420
Okay, understood.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.860
And also, I told the captain of the criminal division

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.340
to not give any cases to you guys even after the vacation ends.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.170
What? Why?

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.810
Why are you so inquisitive?

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.490
It's good if they catch the real perpetrator, and if not, I guess too bad.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.950
So then, as you ordered, I'll...

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.610
"do as you wish..." like...

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.320
I'll tell them to go ahead and do whatever.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.950
You looked into all the male students from that town, right?

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.390
Hey, don't just keep it limited to the town,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.190
and look into factories and construction site workers nearby too.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.940
Yeah.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.880
Okay.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.590
Team Leader, take a look at this.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.900
There's nothing distinct,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.150
but there are about thirty pieces of footage with similar backpacks.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.050
Okay. Now, all we have to do is some legwork.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.100
Let's work a little harder, okay?

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.340
All of us were sitting in front of our desks for two days straight.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.440
At least give us time to go to a sauna and stretch out.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.970
- Okay, well, do as you want.
- Oh, come on!

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.740
We don't even have an investigation budget because we're on vacation!

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.900
Use this to go to a sauna, and this...

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.180
Eat with this. Convenience stores have good meal boxes these days.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.740
- With... with this?
- There are four of us.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.800
Give it back.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.430
Hey, give me your wallet for a second.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.140
I don't have cash, either.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.080
Just give it for a second.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.230
I'll take it out.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.020
What do you think...?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.610
Hey, Maknae.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:47.470
- I can't trust anyone else. You keep it and use it only for things that are absolutely necessary.
- Got it.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.710
He's kind of a big spender.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.360
Detective Oh, what's the limit on this?

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.830
Limit?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.440
There's such a thing?

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.470
This is the first time I've heard that cards have limits.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.070
So annoying.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.530
"Young policemen, the country believes in you."

- Fighting!
- Fighting!

My gosh, he and his young policemen phrase.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.790
Somebody, please tell him to stop talking like an old man.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.860
I hate it so much, really.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.010
Let's just eat.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.150
Your back must be hurting. Why don't you go rest a bit?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.550
It's okay.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.270
I feel physically more comfortable running around than sitting on my butt.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.100
You won't be able to work an office job.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.560
I don't know.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.230
If my body feels comfortable, my heart's not in it,

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.180
and if my heart's in it, my body can't keep up.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.310
Yes, this is Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West Station.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.460
Yes, I'm the one who left the business card at the office.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.740
Oh, really?

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.550
Yes, I'll be over. It won't take long.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.710
Okay.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.500
What is it?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.720
It's a bus driver. He says he remembers seeing that black backpack.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.740
What are you going to do?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.790
I heard Seon Mi asked Ji Yeong to set her up with a blind date.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.150
What? Really?

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.350
- Yeah.
- Ho Joon, you're a bird.

Cuckoo!

It's a good thing. Forget her.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.060
Aren't you sick of your one-sided love?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.260
It's okay, it's okay.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.790
Don't worry about it. I'll introduce you to another girl.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.550
Okay?

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.940
You're Choi Ho Joon, right? Biology major.

Yes, I am.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.470
You need to come with us.

Wh-Wh-Why? Why are you doing this?

[819 | Seongwol-dong]

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.900
Hello.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.460
I came to work in the morning, and I saw the notice that was on the wall.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.270
My memory isn't accurate, but

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.900
I thought I had to tell you, so I contacted you.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.660
Do you remember the black backpack?

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.000
I didn't remember right away after seeing the photo,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.380
but after hearing that the female student who went to Seongwol-dong died,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.800
I remembered it.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.850
You drive this bus, right?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.690
Yes, we run it in three shifts.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.820
Are you saying that you saw that backpack while driving the bus?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.610
Yes.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.180
It must've been hard to remember the backpack of a passenger.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.980
How did you remember?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.680
Well, it's...

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.980
There was an incident that day. That's how I could remember.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.200
And there were no other passengers on the bus except for those two.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.280
Two people?

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.890
Yes.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.940
I'm getting off. Don't follow me.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.820
Hey, I came all the way. Where do you expect me to go?

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm dead if my mom catches me.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.480
And why are you following me? Why?

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.660
You and I don't have the kind of relationship to be takeing each other home.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.940
I'll take you home since I've already come this far.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.120
This area looks dangerous.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.640
I said it's fine, why are you doing this? You're annoying me.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.390
I told you already.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.010
You and I are just classmates in the same major.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.230
We don't have a relationship.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.030
Bus Driver, I'm sorry, but could you open the door again?

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.960
Seon Mi!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.420
- Seon Mi, wait a moment.
- Stop following me!

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.320
- The area is very off the beaten path.
- Come on, let's talk.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.200
I said let go!

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.260
So I was watching in case the female student got hurt.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.840
Ah, yes, yes.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.420
I'm sure of it. This is the backpack.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.860
We checked the dashcam of this bus,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.840
but I don't think the footage of the situation you mentioned was on it.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.360
That happened about a month ago, so it's probably not in any record.

[819]

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.380
Does this help unravel the case or just tangle it up even more?

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.990
Excuse me, D-Detective!

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.990
It's just... would, what I say, make the male student a suspect?

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.020
Well, we need to look into it more.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.330
Well, I'm just concerned.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.760
That student looked like a good person.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.030
I'm concerned that I'm making the wrong person the perpetrator.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.680
Don't worry. We'll investigate thoroughly so that doesn't happen.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.150
I trust you will. It's time to run my bus, so...

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.470
By the way, could you come to the station sometime?

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.120
You could come as a witness when you have time

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.530
and tell the story as you told us earlier.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.020
Well, if you n-need me, I should come in.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.020
- Yes.
- Thank you.

[819 | Last stop: Seongwol-dong]

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.350
Should we look for that student first?
[819 | Last stop: Seongwol-dong]

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.760
This is the phone of the murdered Park Seon Mi.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.860
Explain why it came out of your backpack.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.680
I-I don't know.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.070
I really don't know.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.490
Hey! Who would know about it if not the owner of the bag?

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.260
Are you saying the phone just walked into your backpack?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.040
I really...

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.820
Maybe, Seon Mi accidentally put it in my backpack─

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.400
Seriously.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.850
The place where the phone was turned off was near her house.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.590
That's where she was kidnapped.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.690
If what you're saying is true, that means she put it in your backpack before she was murdered

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.360
to leave a clue that you murdered her before she died!

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.600
No, it's not. Why would I kill Seon Mi?

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.310
I had feelings for her.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.620
Why would I kill someone that I have feelings for?

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.730
You liked her, but she hated you.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.030
You killed her because she wouldn't listen to you, right?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.620
No.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.280
No, really, no.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.400
That's not true. I'm telling you, it's not true.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.130
Mibong mountain.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.950
- Excuse me?
- Mi...bong... mountain.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.450
- Excuse me?
- That's the mountain where you left her body after murdering her!

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.270
I don't know. This is the first time I'm hearing about it.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.770
The murder weapon. Where did you hide it?

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.270
Huh?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.560
What about the rest of the victim's belongings?

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.420
You didn't do this on your own.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.610
Right? You have an accomplice, right?

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:03.010
You two planned it, and made it look like the White Gown Serial Murder, am I right?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.620
Right?

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.830
Say something!

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.440
Hey, it won't benefit you to make this take longer.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.230
- Is that him? What did he say?
- You have an accomplice, right?

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.010
Did he confess?

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.370
- Not yet.
- You two planned it,

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.970
- I heard the victim's phone came out of his backpack.
- and made it look like the White Gown...

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.000
Yes.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.400
- This means that your claim that it was a copycat crime is correct.
- Say something!

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.440
It's not certain yet.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.830
We need to check his alibi, and it seems like we need to check if he has an accomplice.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.470
- Let's end it quickly. The media is saying strange things.
- Hey, it won't benefit you to make this take longer!

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.980
Hey, just say it as it is.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.160
- Yes, just give it a little more time.
- Okay, where's the murder weapon?

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.270
This backpack.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.120
It's Ho Joon's, right?

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.580
- Yeah.
- Ho Joon?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.530
Yes, Choi Ho Joon. He's a friend in our major.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.120
Then it means he was friend with Park Seon Mi, too.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.530
That's right.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.040
Where's Choi Ho Joon? Can you reach him?

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.730
He was taken by detectives earlier.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.730
I think it's the MIU.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.290
Should I check?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.640
Let's leave Choi Ho Joon to them for now, and we just need to keep at our investigation.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.120
Wait, what?

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.850
Ahjussi, ahjussi, stop the bus, please.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.730
I'll stop at the next stop.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.450
What?

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.480
Stop the bus, please!

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.040
I pushed the button.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.840
Why do you keep going?

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.240
This isn't a stop, I can't stop.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.360
I mean, I pushed the button earlier.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.690
You pushed it after we passed.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.470
You saw it late.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.050
Stop it now!

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.570
Wait a little bit. The next stop is just a little further.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:12.010
That's so far from my home!

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.240
I said, stop the bus!

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.700
What?

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.460
What do you think staring at me like that will do?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.270
I'm so scared of you.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.570
How scary.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.680
Stop it.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.390
Stop it before I use swear words.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.710
Are you deaf?

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.030
Stop the bus!

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.520
Driver, just let her off.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.400
It's dangerous.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.180
Get off.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.640
I'm not getting off.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.370
Get off!

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.860
You should've let me get off earlier.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.550
Go back.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.600
Go and stop where I asked you to stop.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.310
If not, I'm not getting off even if I'm dead.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.550
[819]

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:59.170
[Bus Stop]

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.410
Ahjussi, thank you.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.290
What?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.640
Do you want to sleep with me, too?

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.480
Don't have thoughts about things that are out of your league.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.560
Just keep living like that.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.700
Live crawling on the ground for the rest of your life.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.120
Aigoo, what a nasty young woman.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.580
You should let it go.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.430
I'll be back later.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.840
Okay, take this.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.080
I made it with what we had.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.750
I hope you understand.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.820
I didn't sleep so well because a bunch of rude customers came along.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.670
I could've just bought meal boxes at a convenience store.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.250
Thank you.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.440
Eun Hye, I overslept. I'll quickly brush my teeth, so wait just a moment.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.450
No, no. I can go on my own.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.690
I have enough time until the exam. I'll take the bus.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.990
Why would you take the bus? I can take you with my car!

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.180
It's just...

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.770
Let me go on my own. That's more comfortable.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.360
Yeah, let her do that.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.250
You're just going to pressure her if you go along.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.230
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:36.950
I told you last time. Don't try to do well on the test. Just take it with what you have,

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.000
and you just need to pass the cut, so stay calm.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.710
Shh. Stop it. Stop it.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.580
She wants to go on her own because you keep nagging her.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.970
Why won't you let me say anything?

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.840
Don't worry. I'll do fine. I'm confident.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.700
Okay.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.520
Eun Hye,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.450
thank you.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.850
Lee Eun Hye!

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.150
You're Lee Eun Hye, right?

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.130
Yes, I'm Lee Eun Hye.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.890
Ahjussi, please let me go.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.020
Today is my GED (General Educational Development) exam.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.850
I'll just take the exam and come back, please believe me. Please.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.250
You have a record of coming and going to the police station in the past.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.970
- No, that's...
- This is a trick, isn't it?

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.430
Acting like a studying student with a book in your backpack that you don't even look at.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.140
- Jang Yoo Na, you─
- This is her.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.280
She went to steal with me, and I was caught and she ran away.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.460
Don't try to look nice. That doesn't work here.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:02.220
- They're coming at 10:00 on the dot, so don't accept any other clients.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.510
Just leave the afternoon open too.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.050
Let's just make them the only customer today.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.510
She feels uncomfortable with other customers coming and going.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.840
Sure, no problem.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.280
Hello.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.040
I'm sorry, we're closed for reservations for today.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.170
It's been a while.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.260
When did you come back from America?

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.920
Who... are you?

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.880
Don't you remember?

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.620
Two years ago.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.040
I'm sorry, but I can't remember at all.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.630
I think you mistook me for someone else.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.090
I'm a detective.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.230
Don't you remember?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.300
You dirty bitch!

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.750
You bitch!

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.770
Did you see the face of the culprit by any chance?

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.640
Follow me.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.130
Didn't you work in something different in the past?

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.380
I was originally a hair designer.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.090
At that time...

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.900
I was working nights in a part-time job.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.830
Is that good enough?

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.820
You must've earned a lot of money with the part-time job.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.000
This kind of space in Gangnam must be expensive.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.070
Someone invested.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:31.620
I'm the director, but not the owner.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.000
The investigation was discontinued because you suddenly went to America.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.500
It was ended, not discontinued.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.460
Don't you feel like it's unfair?

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.020
Please...

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.200
I've forgotten all about it.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.360
I don't want to remember it again.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.280
It's a violent crime.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.100
I have to continue investigating even if the victim doesn't desire it.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:01.490
At the time, you got a call from the TJ Group's secretary's office and went to that club, right?

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.180
And vice chairman Cheon Sang Woo was there.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.840
Director, they're here.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.470
Yes, okay.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.790
I'm begging you. Please, no more.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.710
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Station.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.850
Yes.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.270
Yes, I know Eun Hye.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.760
How's the state of your hair?

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.950
- I think it's good.
- Excuse me,

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.140
I'll see you around.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.700
I went to the club with him.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.330
Handsome.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.350
Yes.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.990
People won't forget him once they see him.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.650
Eun Hye.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.780
I'm sorry.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.560
No, you did well.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.040
Giving my contact to the detective was a good idea.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:49.010
Because Eun Hye is close to a detective, you thought they would release her no matter what, right?

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.750
And you thought that you would be released along with her.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.840
I just explained exactly what happened.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.960
Eun Hye is close to us.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.810
She's family.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.940
So basically, you dragged in a detective's family member.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.840
Detectives don't have any power.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.610
We can't release people who committed a crime.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.070
However,

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.490
we don't let people who bother our family get away with it.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.800
You made a mistake.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.950
Well, she was specifically pointed out to be an accomplice,

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:29.900
so we can't really...

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.990
You know Detective Kang Do Chang from Incheon West Station, right?

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.020
Yes. I know him well.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.110
That's his daughter.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.530
He didn't get married yet.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.260
He doesn't have a daughter.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.600
They have different last names too.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.580
He thinks of her as his daughter.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.740
Lee Eun Hye's home address is his house, too.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.460
I'll check with him.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.280
Don't you think it's better not to?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.740
You know him.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.990
He'll run over here and make a huge mess.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.550
Even so, if this becomes a problem in the future...

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.860
Oh Ji Hyeok from the Violent Crimes Division Team 2 of Incheon West Station.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.400
If Lee Eun Hye is revealed to be an accomplice, I'll be responsible and bring her back.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.130
If by chance, she runs away, everything will be my responsibility.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.300
I'll send the recording to your phone.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.110
010...

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.100
8867...

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.470
Why aren't you asking?

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.220
I could really be an accomplice.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.600
It's not that I trust you. I trust myself.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.990
My intuitions as a detective.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.500
You've dealt with a lot of bad people, right?

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.580
I am originally a bad person.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.520
Really bad.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.660
Do you think I will change?

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.870
I want to change, but I don't think I will.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.650
Because my past will hinder me from changing.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.480
Stop it.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.590
Just because you went through some hard times, don't just define your life haphazardly.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.350
Your past wasn't made by you.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.560
It's not the bag that we're looking for, but he looked suspicious.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.290
We raided it just in case, and these came out.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.970
We're good at sniffing out criminals, you know?

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.130
You all should go on vacation more often.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.420
You capture criminals if you're given vacations.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.060
Team Leader, we looked into this, and he has a drug history.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.110
If we keep digging, I think we can catch some more.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.320
Let's keep digging.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.520
Should we? Should we do that?

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.650
Is there progress or what?

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.280
Who's that?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.360
Is he the perpetrator?

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:04.750
He is a different type of perpetrator than the one you want.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.160
But Chief, our team worked hard to catch him.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.930
It's a small fish.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:15.280
If we peel it carefully, we might find something big inside.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.210
Who are you?

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.880
Well, we're Violent Crimes Division Team 2 of Incheon West Station.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.460
Correct.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.420
Those small fish.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:30.150
Do you believe they're a fitting level for Violent Crimes Division Team 2 of the Incheon West station?

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.890
I understand.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.040
- Turn it over to the DOA (Narcotics Division).
- Why?

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.380
Give it to whom? Never!

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.900
He said it's below your level, you bastards!

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.020
That mean ol'...

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.410
Aigoo, my Princess. How come you gave your dad a call?

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.640
What?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.070
Why are you suddenly quitting your job?

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:04.150
Hey, there's no such thing as a company that fits your aptitude. It's you who matches it.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:09.150
Also, you got into a big company after working so hard and now─

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.120
Hey, are you drinking?

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.870
Hey, Bo Kyeong!

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.860
Oh, she was quiet for a while. What is it this time?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.940
The person you have dialed is not available.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.540
This feels like she'll cause big trouble.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.160
It's delicious. Are you a regular here?

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.250
The atmosphere is nice too, and easy to have a conversation as well.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.050
I think your father-in-law needs to stay there for a little while.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.200
It doesn't look good on our side.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.470
It'll cause a big wave to our economy.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.220
It's about time for a change.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.710
Isn't it old-fashioned to give your business to your child these days?

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.200
It should change.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.800
But... why did it have to be...?

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.630
Who do you think the owner of TJ is?

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.050
As a person who does housework for our country,

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.750
TJ is one of the most important housekeepers.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:35.000
If the owner of TJ dismantled it and took it apart, we would be affected badly.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.150
The problem is that we don't have the right to stop that owner's tyranny.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.640
There's only one way to stop it.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.300
Shifting the management team of TJ.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.000
I think McQueen Group is the owner that the Blue House people were talking about.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.630
Those bastards probably want me to stay here.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.960
Because that would be a good excuse to swallow TJ.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.890
Yes. Well, the Blue House and McQueen want different things, but it's clear that they both stand opposite us.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:16.500
If McQueen wanted you as a business manager, what would you do?

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.940
Don't you think you would feel a little greedy, too?

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.260
That's not a possibility.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.890
I spent my whole life to grow TJ.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:31.370
Wouldn't it be better to give it to you rather than some other bastard?

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.930
Chairman.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.330
You don't think there's a possibility?

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.340
McQueen has more power than me right now.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.780
If you shake hands with them, you would be able to get TJ.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.480
What do you want to hear from me?

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.720
Should I answer that I can do it?

00:40:53.720 --> 00:41:00.390
There's someone who thinks the same within our group.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.050
Find out who that is.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.100
If you can't,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.430
you're that person.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.610
What should we eat?

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.390
Whatever you like. Anything's fine.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:23.230
- Thai food?
- Okay.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.860
Do you remember the Thai restaurant on 7th Ave. in New York City called Cao Chai?

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.610
That's the first place you and I met privately.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.410
Also, that was our last.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.660
- Let's go. I know a place that has good Thai food.
- Alright.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.100
One second.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.980
Yes.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.910
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of meeting someone.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.250
I'll call back when I'm free.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.890
Okay.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.850
Your husband has a really good voice.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.750
Is that what you fell for?

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.190
Give me a second. I'll come along after a phone call.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.660
Wait in the car.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.390
Sure.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.510
What are you doing over there?

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.800
I'm looking at you.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.840
I'll be going to the office after dinner.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.240
Go there first and wait.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.370
Find out who that is.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.920
If you can't, it's you.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.370
[TJ Board Member Cheon Na Na]

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.050
The number you have dialed is currently switched off.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.830
Was it you, Na Na?

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.770
The number you have dialed is currently switched off. Please leave a message after the beep.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.800
The number you have dialed is currently switched off.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.710
Chief, why are you still at work this late?

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.840
Chief.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.640
Bong Sik, track a location of a phone for me.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.980
Black backpack.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.950
This is going to take forever.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.100
Yes?

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.600
Well, that location won't take long to get to, but we─

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.700
Yes, I understand. Yes.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.090
Hyeong, Team Leader asked us to look for the chief's daughter.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.420
What's this now?

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.720
He asked us to find her. Her phone must be turned off.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.470
Hey, tell them no.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:16.800
Why is he mobilizing detectives to find his daughter? What are we, his slaves?

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.090
Hey, don't give it any thought.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.420
I'm suddenly furious.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.180
Hyeong, this is his daughter.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.700
Where is she right now?

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.100
Let's go look for her right away. It's dangerous these days.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.140
She looks like a celebrity.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.750
- I'm not going!
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.860
I said I'm not going home!

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.040
Your father must be worried, you should go home.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.550
I'm really not drunk at all today.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.750
Just one more.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.290
Do you want to rest somewhere first then?

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.020
- Let's go for a third round.
- Third round?

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.670
- Yes, third round.
- Okay! Third round!

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.850
One, two, three.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.910
Okay. Now, third round.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.550
I'm really upset right now.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.530
- So just let me have one drink, okay?
- Let's go to Do Chang Hyeong's place for now.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.100
- Tell him to come there.
- Just one drink, please?

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.230
- You and I will have a drink, okay?
- Yes.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.960
We found her,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.010
but her state is... She's impossible to transport.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.790
We think the chief has to come himself.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.660
Thank you.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.810
- Your Girlfriend?
- I wish.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.620
- That's the chief's daughter.
- Oh my goodness!

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.000
She must take after her mother.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.400
Hello, Chief.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.570
Yes, yes. Hello. By any chance...

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.020
Hey! Bo Kyeong!

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.190
Dad!

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.330
Why did you do that?

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.870
Do you know how worried I was?

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.230
Who is it? Who's making you suffer so much?

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.060
Dad, what am I supposed to do?

What's so great about them compared to me?

I mean, isn't it natural to make some mistakes when you start out?

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:26.140
Is it such a big issue to miss a few numbers?

Jealousy. That's something

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.040
that blinds a person.

Right, Eun Hye?

So, you're saying that you drank alone in your room?

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.310
That's the most common repertoire that people without an alibi spew.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.600
It's true.

Ho Joon, Choi Ho Joon, let's end this on a positive note for the both of us.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.310
Okay, it wasn't premeditated.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:02.340
You killed her out of anger after drinking, and you made it look like the serial murder.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.820
In conclusion, this case is an accidental crime.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:15.050
I mean, this case is obviously a planned crime, but

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.290
we don't think you're like that.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:23.110
However, the police viewing it as an accidental crime,

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:29.200
versus a premeditated crime is a huge difference.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.770
I'll do it.

just like you said,

I'll say I did it.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.010
That's enough, right?

Moreover, it's the top core department at the headquarters.

Why would I quit? Do you think I'm crazy?

Yeah. Okay.

I love you, Dad.

Yes, of course. It's great.

I'm not just resting.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:30.220
I figured something out.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.170
I just need an hour.

Also, tell everyone to stay in the office until I get there.

Wh-Why did you bring me here?

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.530
Hey, don't pretend. This is where you dumped Park Seon Mi's body.

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.970
N-N-No! I won't go! I won't!

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.280
We cleaned up the site, so just go and check it.

- I'm not going. I don't want to go!

I won't go. I won't.

Why would I go where Seon Mi died?

I won't go.

Hey! Get up!

This is part of the process.

- Send him home.
- Excuse me?

I said, send him home!

This punk isn't the culprit, so send him home!

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:11.190
The triangles are where the bodies were found.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:16.240
Blue is where we were looking for the owner of the backpack after checking the victims' movement.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.180
The victims' main activity points.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.710
And Black is where the victims lived.

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:26.070
This here is a map that was enlarged with Seongwol-dong as the focus.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:31.140
At a glance, there seems to be no real connection other than the proximity.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:36.750
However, I'll draw the bus route that I was on all day today.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.950
This is the starting point of the bus.

Here's the fourth victim, Jeong Hui Joo.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.350
Excluding this stop near her house,

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.760
all of this is connected by this.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.970
Wow! Hey!

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.790
How did you figure that out?

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.250
As Do Chang Hyeongnim said, I could only find out by moving on my feet.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:26.280
I told you, if you listen to me, you will get some rice cake even while you're sleeping.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.530
By the way, why isn't that one on the top connected?

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.150
Well that's...

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.190
probably because they used a different transportation method.

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:40.480
That means the culprit usually took the bus and committed the crime.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.310
But we checked all the CCTV footage from the buses.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.180
Watch out!

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:55.150
If the culprit committed the crime by taking the bus,

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.110
they must've been on it all day long.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.830
Then there should've been at least one person who stood out on the security camera.

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.290
There's a way to not stand out.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:10.170
Someone who's not on people's minds even if they're

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.150
on the bus' security camera all day long.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.820
The bus driver.

This is the dashcam footage I secured just in case.

This is the bus, right?

01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:59.930
Yes. It is.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.540
This was taken at the site where the body was left.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.300
It's far from the usual bus route.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:11.980
The culprit had the victim on this bus and dumped the body.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.550
And because it's just a bus, nobody cared about the CCTV footage.

One is about three stops from the last stop, so it'll be back soon.

We don't have time. We'll wait here and check the bus that's coming back,
