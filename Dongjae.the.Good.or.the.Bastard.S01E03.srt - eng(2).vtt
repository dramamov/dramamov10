Yes.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.920
It's close to the city.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.880
Why do you want to sell
Cheongju land in Seoul?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.050
I thought it'd be easier.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.140
I'm not sure if people
in Seoul will be interested.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100
It doesn't have any favorable.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
How much would you sell it for
per 3.3 square meter?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.320
- 150 dollars.
- That's so cheap.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.150
Because it's in the countryside--

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.070
It's not. It's still a city.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.610
That was the price 10 years ago
not because it's the countryside.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.580
And it'll be redeveloped soon.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.830
Redeveloped?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.000
I have a friend in Cheongju,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.080
but I haven't heard that yet.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.710
If you know it'll be redeveloped,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.710
why are you selling it
for the price 10 years ago?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.750
If you keep it
and build a building,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.380
you'll soon be a landlord.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.300
You mean it'll be hard to sell
in Seoul?

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.300
You should just build a building.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.300
I see that it's close
to downtown Cheongju.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.770
Even a small building will
get you a few million easily.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.230
Not anyone can build a building.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.640
People get a loan to do it.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.650
No one builds it
with their own money.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.360
I'm saying this
because it's a shame.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.360
If it really is getting
redeveloped, it's a jackpot.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.030
You're right.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.160
I guess you're not interested
in money.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.580
Bye.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.790
What are you doing?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.920
Same old same old.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.380
Hey, is that place
getting redeveloped?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.050
How big?

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.140
That poor old man won't sell
his house.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.760
That project is worth
hundreds of millions.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.600
What if that one site
causes a big damage?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.850
Sir. Wait.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.140
I'll buy that land. Sell it to me.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.770
Did he say it was close
to the diner?

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.570
What if I hold out
like Happiness Diner?

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.700
No, why bother holding out?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.070
If I retire and become
a landlord in Cheongju,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.700
people will cuss at me, right?

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.620
People I know will blame me
so much.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.540
That they'd seen that in me.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.080
Why am I getting thirsty?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.960
Iced Americano, please.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.590
I can move out of Cheongju.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.300
I'll visit there from time to time
for the rent.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.800
No.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.180
By then, no one will know me.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.140
The rest of my life
wouldn't be so different.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.810
If I keep falling behind
and end up becoming a lawyer,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.570
I'll have to leave home before
sunrise and work past midnight.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.780
And that's only if I do well.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.570
How long do I have to live
like this for?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.750
Tell him that I sent you.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.870
Beg him with your all.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Whether you go on your knees
or cry your heart out.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.380
It costs you nothing,
and it's not illegal.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.470
Then
you'll never have to see me again.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.010
I doubt it.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.180

till the day he dies.

The moment I don't give up
on the land,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.640
I'm stuck with CEO Nam for good.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.110
In the end,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.480
it's about crawling
under CEO Nam's legs

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.610
or retire
as a corrupted prosecutor

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.240
at loose ends,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.030
isn't it?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.660
What lame options.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.200
It's not like I could ask anyone.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.500
I wish I could ask
a fortuneteller.

You haven't changed.

You look fairer.

How did you decide to reach me?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.780
If I called you as much as I cared
about you, I'd call you every day.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.120
I held back because I knew
you were busy.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.540
That hasn't changed either.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.910

with my future.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.870
Then for some reason,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.500
you came to my mind.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.540
Are you quitting?

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.050
I'm sure you're probably
aware of it already.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.670
To be honest,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.890
I'm getting fired, not quitting.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.680
Should I run a business?

Do you have anything in mind?

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.350
How about commercial leases?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.270

I'm not saying I have a building
right now.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.110

if I were to do that?

Don't think
about doing anything stupid.

But...

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.960
Are you sure about that?

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.840
Why are you asking me that?

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.640
I mean,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.350

back to the surface.

No, nothing new.

People like to keep bringing back
what happened in the past.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.780
Come here. I'll tell my office.

and being fired for real
are completely different.

Don't test your luck forever.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.250
Yes, sir.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.590
Thank you, sir.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.090
I was almost ashamed.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.430
Right.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.850
I can handle anything but that.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.810
Cap, you need to watch this.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.520
What now?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.900
This is the surveillance camera
footage from the bar yesterday.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.810
I thought there was nothing
aside from smashing the place.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.400
This was filmed
just before the violent attack.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.780
Wait.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.780
Right? From Happiness Diner?

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.870
Seo... What was his name again?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.120
Seo Dong-jae.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.500
Who did he meet?
Do we have that too?

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.130
Wait.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.300
Isn't that him?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.380
Yes, Nam Wan-seong
from Ehong Construction.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.720
They've met,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.300
but only for 5 minutes.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.140
In the hostess bar.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.480
We could nitpick at him
with this if we try.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.350
Any idea on how to take advantage
of him?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.230
But he has nothing to do with us.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.690
Still, with prosecutors'
current attitude,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.030
we have no excuse
to summon Choi Geum-ho.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.740
We need to find an excuse
to get a warrant and search him.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.120
- Yes.
- Yes, captain.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.830
Hello, teacher.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.460
Gosh, Yu-ri?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.290
Did she skip school again
yesterday?

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.630
Yes.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.550
I'm sorry. I didn't see her
this morning either.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.100
I'll call you back. Thank you.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.770
Seriously, that brat.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.730
(My daughter)

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.600
7, 8...

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.860
(Dad)

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.080
6,000.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.750
7,000.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.330
8,000.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.790
600.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.640
(You have a new message)

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.180
Heard you got
the whole bag stolen.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.810
Gosh.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.480
Who dared to get their hands
on your stuff?

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.030
You should've told me.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.320
Then I wouldn't have wasted
my energy.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.530
I'll pay for the repair.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.910
Whatever.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.460
Better spend that to pay
for your boys' lives.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.630
On the funeral cost of jerks
who were in my place last night.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.170
So,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.840
I'm going to retrieve my stuff,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.630
handle those who stole it,
and settle it once and for all.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.390
After settling it,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.680
I'll join hands with you again.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.470
I'll give you the whole bag.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.680
Before that,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.230
you better handle the jerks

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.850
who bruised my vice president.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240
Thank you, Geum-ho.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.330
What did he say?

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.740
What did Mr. Kang say?

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.410
Oh, he's working on it.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.330
He said he'd send it
as soon as possible.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.420
He must be running short in Seoul.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.000
He's not giving me a firm answer.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.670
What about the kids?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800
I have them waiting already.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.640
Hello, boss.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.550
This way.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.100
They offered to pay multifold,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.600
but they haven't received
any response either.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.350
Where did you get the purple?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.150
You prick.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.270
You went to pick it up.
Where did you pick it up?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.240
Oh, I just went alone--

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.280
The place.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.790
The fire hydrant in the first
floor of Lucky Building.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.550
You?

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.920
The water tank
in Sinsung Apartment rooftop.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.390
You?

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.140
I got it from the first floor
of Namil Villa.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.810
He noticed it.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.570
Who noticed what?

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.820
The fire hydrant. Villa.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.530
That's the places we heard
from the other loonies.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.410
Right? Nothing new, huh?

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.460
The thief noticed it.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.090
If the thief went off the grid
as soon as we found

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.920
where he made deals,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.760
he noticed we were watching him.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.520
You prick.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.520
Stop right there.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.190
Damn it.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.820
Who got busted?

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.410
Still, keep your eye on them.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.750
Of course.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.370
I keep messaging him
to make a deal,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.590
and I'll check on the boys
on watch.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.590
You should go watch
my adorable nephew.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.020
You should come see him
by the day after tomorrow.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.140
Yes.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.790
Damn, I can't see his face.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.340
He covered it so tightly.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.630
Stop right there.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.140
You brat. Stop right there.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.230
Get back here.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.320
Hey.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.360
I should've caught him then.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.290
(Dong-pal)

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.080
Jesus. He scared me.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.800
Hello?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.470
Now is not a good time. I will...

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.140
No, that's not it.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.810
Avoid you? Why would I...

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.970
Yes, I'll meet you there.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.310
Yes.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.770
What a pain in the ass.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.040
So

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.460
does that prove

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.830
I wasn't lying?

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.380
Won is the one you sell it to?

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.710
- The stuff you get from Seoul?
- Yes.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.630
If they made a fuss over the stuff
that we didn't even have,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.100
it provides crucial evidence
that I didn't bail them

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.640
on purpose, right?

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.180
Why are you telling me that now?

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.440
You should've told me about
Won's clique in the first place.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.150
Are you really going to
arrest them all?

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.030
What's the name of your dealer
from Seoul?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.160
Mr. Kang.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.530
Does he make it at home
or something?

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.330
What's taking so long
to make those tiny pills?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.250
Because he also receives supplies.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.830
That's why he's not called
a professor.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.340
What does that mean?
Who makes it then?

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.670
If we'd known,
we would've visited him already.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.550
To demand supplies immediately.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.760
'Look, old man.'

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.600
'Cheongju's economy is stuck
because of you.'

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.600
So when is this Mr. Kang
providing the supplies?

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.230
When will you get Choi Geum-ho
ready for me?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.150
We won't know until we get it.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200
Prosecutor Jo.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.580
When you're in the act,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.240
you must arrest him at once.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.250
Because my brother-in-law

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.170
never gives a second chance.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.090
Why are you so desperate
to go after your brother-in-law?

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.060
Because I feel bad for my sister.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.350
She had to marry that scumbag.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.110
You're not any different from him.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.240
Nothing shows that
the vice president sneaked

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.740
the stuff behind your back.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:47.950
Keep your eye on him.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.950
Yes, boss.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.340
Sit down.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.180
So? Do you like it here?

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.680
Of course.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.720
You got me the most expensive
postpartum center.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.230
What is it?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.440
I can't get the hospital band
off my wrist.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.520
Let me.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.870
Chan-hyuk's on a business trip
for so long.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.080
What? Miss your brother?

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.750
Miss him?
Who misses their brothers?

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.340
What?

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.670
- What about me?
- What about you?

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.970
Did you miss me?

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.010
You're always next to me,

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.010
so I don't miss you,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.270
but don't make me miss you.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.980
Okay. I'll be by your side
until you get sick of me.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.270
You're always busy.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.320
Excuse me.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.080
(Mr. Kang)

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.000
Hello?

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.750
What?

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.250
Gosh.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.220
Answer my phone.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.970
Cap.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.390
I'm going home for a sec.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.260
About the hostess bar
search warrant.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.680
What? Was it declined again?

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.230
- I was told to redeem it.
- We should,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.730
but we can't redeem it
without the warrant.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.480
Damn it.
Nothing's in my favor today.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.400
Cap.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.860
What now?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.820
Prosecutor Seo visited
the hostess bar,

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.610
and he met the CEO
of Ehong in there.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.240
Then I saw Ehong's CEO visiting
Lee Kyung-hak.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.170
I checked the visitor's name
just in case,

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.130
and it was Nam Wan-seong
just as I thought.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.920
I think there's a connection
between the three

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.470
or maybe not.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.720
What did they talk about
during the visit?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.390
They were accompanied by a lawyer.
It wasn't recorded.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.720
Are you going home?

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.430
On my way to get the warrant.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.680
Good luck with that.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.270
Come in.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.740
The consultation was encouraging.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.200
We'll soon see a visible result.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.950
I'm here to deliver that news.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.370
What do you mean by soon?

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.490
Really soon.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.540
- Please make that happen by now.
- Yes, boss.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.290
Before the new type of drug
spreads in the country,

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.670
let's tell the whole country

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.460
that we the criminal department
rooted it out.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.760
So we can have it twice
from our team.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.590
Have what twice?

(2023 Model Prosecutor,
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae)

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.770
Model Prosecutor?

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.350
Didn't you have anyone better--

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.350
I know. You should've rushed.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.480
- Then you wouldn't have lost it.
- Lose what?

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.860
I'd lose that to Seo Dong-jae
of all people...

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.820
I mean, Mr. Seo?

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.280
Why don't you call me by my name?

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.820
I wouldn't dare to.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.790
If I do that, you can call me
Jo Bum-gun

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.370
instead of Jo Byung-gun.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.250
What about Choi Geum-ho's
hostess bar?

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.880
I ordered to wrap it up
by arresting the ones

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.670
who got caught in the act.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.720
Thank you.

What did Seo Dong-jae do?

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.020
If she's going to give it to him,
give it to everyone.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.890
We all worked together. Damn it.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.810
Hey, Prosecutor Kim.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.980
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.610
Me?

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.900
I was passing by.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.280
Whether you were passing by
or walking by,

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.580
say hi if you saw me.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.120
I already did this morning.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.670
Do I need to say hi
every time I see you?

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.210
Hey.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880
Hey.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.980

Oh, you're back.

- Are you out of the hospital?
- How are you feeling?

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.190
You're off until tomorrow.
You should've taken a rest.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.780
Come in.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.200
Is it urgent?

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.160
The senior prosecutor wanted
to see you

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.540
when you return to the office.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.750
Shoot.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.210
But you're off until tomorrow.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.130
I think she can wait
until tomorrow.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.790
Okay.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.710
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes?

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.010
Get me all the cases

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.220
related to Ehong Construction.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.970
They had a casualty issue
February last year,

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.010
but they weren't prosecuted.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.850
They were prosecuted this year
for a case,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.770
but the witness was suspended.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.480
The witness was suspended?

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.730
Did I do that in my office?

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.480
No, it was Prosecutor Kim Ji-hee.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.020
- Prosecutor Kim?
- Yes.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.690
Ehong Construction sounded
familiar, so when I looked it up,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.240
there were many cases
in the past few years.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.400
- Do you want everything?
- Yes.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.110
If it's a case, does it have
CEO Nam Wan-seong's address too?

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.030
- I'll find it for you.
- Thanks.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.740
You must've been busy
while I was away.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.830
Yes.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.750
Huh? Really?

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.710
Remember
the land sales cancellation

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.880
due to a mistake

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.670
and the land purchase
through a fraud?

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.130
Where was that again?

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.470
- Mooncheon-dong.
- Yes.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.590
Get me all the land sales
contract cancellation

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.640
including them.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.890
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.730
You must've been busy
while I was away.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.400
Oh, no, sir. Not at all.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.570
You were injured.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.690
I was worried about you.
I'm glad you're back safe.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.740
See that, Sung Si-woon?

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.030
Recognize the difference?

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.040
That the investigator was
closer to the fact?

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:44.950
What?

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.910
Are you saying that I lied?

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.540
You've been working
all night long.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.880
And the investigator
was worried about you a lot.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.550
What...

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.090
I was worried about you a lot too.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.550
Once things settle,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.310
I'll take you out for dinner!

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.730
How could you say that?

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.440
He asked me about the difference
between you two.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.280
Gosh, we'll end up having dinner.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400
What?

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.370
Why would people be worried

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.530
about work?

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.290
A hostess bar isn't
a sacred place.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.830
How many times do I need to apply
for a warrant

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.040
to search a small town's bar?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.460
I know. Why do they keep
sending it back?

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.050
I've been asking to approve it.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.760
But why does the judge
keep declining it?

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.090
We did everything we could

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.220
in the scene that day.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.260
Perhaps that's why.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.100
You arrested everyone you could
in the scene.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.390
Maybe the judge thought
it wasn't necessary anymore?

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.270
Or are you worried

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.900
that you'll be in trouble
if we keep digging in deeper?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.190
Why would we be in trouble?

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.900
What did a prosecutor do

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.570
after meeting Cheongju's
wealthiest man in a hostess bar?

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.820
Are you urging me to submit
the report

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.450
for that footage?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.950
The one
with his face recorded clearly?

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.450
Is that it?

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.330
- Who?
- Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.720
Come in.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.770
You recovered faster
than expected.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.560
How do you feel?

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.480
I'm all good now.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.900
Is this what you call
a blessing in disguise?

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.440
I was injured already.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.070
To make it a blessing in disguise,
it's time for a good occasion.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.700
But I have nothing to celebrate.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.490
Says who?

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.410
Congratulations.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.790
For me?

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.470
Out of 19 recommended people
in the whole country,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.180
only 3 were selected.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.100
You sacrificed yourself

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.600
to resolve a longterm
unsolved murder.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.270
You deserve to be
a model prosecutor.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.850
And it was me who recommended you.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.190
The chief deputy prosecutor will
reward you in the supreme office.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.030
The supreme office?
The chief deputy prosecutor?

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.280
Prepare your speech.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.400
You'll have an interview
after the award.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.570
Thank you, boss.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.450
I'll do my best.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.450
You're already doing your best.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.540
Come with me,
Mr. Model Prosecutor.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.250
Yes, boss.

- Prosecutor Seo.
- Yes?

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.340
You need to leave that here.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.760
Oh, my bad.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.520
Let's go.

(Prosecution Service)

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:12.040
Mr. Seo.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.790
Is Mr. Seo not here?

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.000
He's not.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.420
My goodness.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.960
There he is.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.340
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes?

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.420
The cap has a question for you.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.430
Hello.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.300
Hello.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.640
Long time no see.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.180
You have questions
for Prosecutor Seo?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.140
I saw Prosecutor Seo
in the surveillance camera footage

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.520
of Yulryang-dong hostess bar
the night the fight occurred.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.310
You met someone there that day.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.900
Mr. Seo, since when did you keep
in touch with CEO Nam of Ehong?

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.700
What are you? A magnet?

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.620
Why do regional wealth
like you so much?

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.700
If you've seen
the surveillance camera footage,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.750
you know that I wasn't there
for a long time.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.410
- Yes.
- Then what do you want to know?

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.000
He's curious because he's a cop.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.000
If you weren't going to stay
that long, why did you meet him

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.500
in a hostess bar?

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.710
You know CEO Nam is
full of issues.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.180
Do you meet him often?

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.760
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.640
By paying her!

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.600
No, boss.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.400
Is that when you met him?

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.030
What do you know about this?
Get back in the office.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.280
CEO Nam Wan-seong
of Ehong Construction

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.530
sent Prosecutor Seo $200.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.200
Tell me the whole story.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.330
Someone sent fruit and $200
to his ward.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.200
I took it without a clue,

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.420
so he returned it to CEO Nam
on my behalf.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.290
Prosecutor Seo told him to wait.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.670
I guess CEO Nam was
in the hostess bar at the time.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:46.630
Yes.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.010
Did you return the money?

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.590
I threw the envelope at him.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.720
Then it'd take less than 5
minutes. That makes sense now.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.600
Why did you want to ask that?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.760
Well, actually

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.470
you know Lee Kyung-hak
from Happiness Diner?

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.850
CEO Nam visited him.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.230
You arrested Lee Kyung-hak.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.940
Well, some say otherwise.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.280
You met CEO Nam

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.950
right after he visited
Lee Kyung-hak.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.990
I wondered if you heard anything
about what he said

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.820
during the visit by any chance.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.450
Didn't you record it?

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.160
He was with his lawyer.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.960
- Know anything?
- Nope.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.040
I didn't talk to CEO Nam
about anything

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.340
and told him to keep
that chicken feed to himself.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.420
- That's what he says.
- Yes.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.970
I see.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.720
You were almost mistaken.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.640
I got you cleared, right?

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.060
Bye now.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.270
Bye.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.310
- Bye now.
- Goodbye.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.860
The address you asked for.

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.070
Jo Byung-gun!

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.620
I've emailed you all the cases

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.740
that involved Ehong Construction
down to 2020.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.580
I'll look for anything before that

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.870
from now on.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.620
Okay.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.420
Thanks.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.410
Shoot. Why is the wall so high?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.510
Shoot.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:01.310
Boyfriend?

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.060
Off to the bowling alley?

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.730
How's her wound?

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.740
Is she okay now?

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.240
Who are you?

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.120
Wait. What was your name again?
Nam...

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.330
Nam...

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.700
Nam...

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.460
Is your dad home?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.960
No.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.210
He said he was.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.090
No, he's not home yet.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.720
Are you really
CEO Nam Wan-seong's son?

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.220
Your dad is home.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.220
No one's home.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.310
Is it true?

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.720
I don't know.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.020
Both the adult or the kid
in this family...

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:49.810
Damn it.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.610
I can't see anything.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.630
(Mr. Seo Dong-jae)

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:21.760
Yes, Mr. Seo.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.560
Prosecutor Kim, remember Nam
Wan-seong from Ehong Construction?

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.640
Of course.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.480
Why was the witness suspended?

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.400
The witness went missing.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.110
The key witness suddenly
went missing

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.780
and hasn't been found yet.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.820
What's it about?

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.530
Where are you? At work?

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:40.660
Outside.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.080
Can I tell you tomorrow?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.500
Sure.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.340
(Witness suspended)

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.000
(Boss)

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.120
Yes, boss.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.210
Yes.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.340
No, I'm on my way to the dorm...

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.170
Gun death?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.630
Now? Me?

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.760
Okay. I'm on my way. Yes.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.560
Is this Texas or what?

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.850
Gun death?

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.600
Why would she give me that case?

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.110
Where is it?

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.930
Thank you for your work.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.770
Thank you for your work.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.360
Geez.
