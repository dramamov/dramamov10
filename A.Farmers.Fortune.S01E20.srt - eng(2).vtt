=Episode 20=

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.040
Right there.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.760
Tomorrow in the Court Hall,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.520
you must insist

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.560
that He Qingqing conspired with her lover

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.920
to seize wealth and take lives.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800
Once we get rid of her,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.720
the Fu Family estate

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240
will be entirely ours.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.360
Rest assured.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.680
That foolish lad Xiaosheng

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.200
now stands on my side too.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
They have no way out.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.440
Though, to be fair,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440
I've done so much already.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.720
Yet I only get half the share.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.520
That might not be enough.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.360
We agreed on this beforehand.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.760
Why suddenly raise the price?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.440
Dear young lady,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.880
if I hadn't met the real Fu Qinghuai

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.080
at the bandits' stronghold,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.960
how could you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
have set up such a ruthless trap?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.080
Alright.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.240
As long as you can get rid of them,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.840
we split sixty-forty.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040
Look at you, that sly little grin

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.080
really makes you likable.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.520
I'm already a married woman.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.480
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.880
A married woman

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.600
is even more intriguing.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.760
Let go.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.520
Alright, alright.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.840
I'd say He Qingqing's got some charm too.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.880
If you're not willing,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.760
then I'll just…

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.600
Alright.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.640
Just don't go back on your word.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.640
Alright, alright.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.000
Take it off, this one too.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.920
Can you be gentler?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
What are you doing?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.040
What?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.840
You tell me, what is it?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.960
My dear, I...

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.280
What are you doing?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.480
Datian, let me explain.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.320
Silence.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.040
Inside your belly,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.320
isn't there...?

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.040
How could you do this?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.760
I will end you.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.840
I swear I will end you!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.280
Datian.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.320
You've slain him.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.280
How could you slay him?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.120
Quiet!

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.920
One more cry and you'll join him.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.660
I'm going to report this

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.840
to the authorities.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.200
Report it to the officials?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.240
Go ahead then.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.200
I'd like to see how they'll judge you,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840
a shameless woman

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.120
plotting with her lover
to murder her husband.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400
Right now,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.680
you've got no other options.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760
Tomorrow,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200
we'll proceed smoothly

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.840
and take the Fu Family estate.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.320
I might even spare you a way out.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.920
But if...

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.920
you don't behave...

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.120
Stop crying. Close the door.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.880
Get up, don't sleep.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.560
Village Chief summons you.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280
At this point,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.560
you should

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.480
reveal your true identity.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.960
I am

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.320
Fu Qinghuai.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.600
Well, well, you deceitful man.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.100
Still refuse to admit?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.720
There are many people

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.840
in this world named Fu Qinghuai.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.280
You see it now.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.480
And you've heard it.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.840
So you're admitting

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.400
you're not Xiaosheng
and Tangbao's real father.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.000
He's not their real father.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.120
He's a swindler.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.440
Are you their father?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.720
I have an official document.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.540
No need to prove myself.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.160
What a coincidence.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.000
I also have an official document.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.440
It proves you're not Fu Qinghuai.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.600
Ruofeng.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.840
This man's real name is Pan Cai.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.200
He is a wanted man
by the Imperial Court.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.320
A wanted criminal, of all things!

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.620
(Certificate of Proof, Wanted)
What is going on here?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.920
These two documents…

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.880
Which one is real?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.720
Village Chief.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.680
No matter how he managed

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.920
to forge this document,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.000
it doesn't clear him from

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.880
colluding with He Qingqing.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.160
Village Chief,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.680
we don't know who the real Fu Qinghuai is.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.280
But it was you

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600
who dissuaded him from divorcing me.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.760
Even so,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.440
we were only raising our child

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.580
and doing the business.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.440
How could that be collusion?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.680
That's right, you all know it.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.440
If they had planned this together,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.840
why would they ever break up?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.840
Exactly.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.320
Sanniang,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.000
everyone knows you and He Qingqing

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.320
are as close as family.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.120
Of course you'd speak up for her.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.480
Tian Xifeng, you…

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
I knew a shameless woman

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.820
like you wouldn't admit it.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.040
However,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.440
we have a witness.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.240
Bring them in.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.320
Son, come here.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.280
Xiaosheng?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.320
Tell everyone the truth

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.200
about their secret dealings.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.720
You're not my father.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.720
You're a killer.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.440
A killer… a murderer?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.720
Tian Xifeng.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.120
I've never treated you unfairly.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.280
Why join forces with him

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.200
to bring me harm?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.840
I did not.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.320
I... I did not.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.440
No, he's talking nonsense.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.160
He's lost his senses.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
Yes, yes, he's lost his senses.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.480
Last night,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.440
I returned home

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.400
and found him

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.280
with Tian Xifeng

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.000
already in bed.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.680
I never imagined

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.000
he would take my life

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.760
and cast my body away.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.440
Thankfully, Xiaosheng found me in time,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.560
pulling me from the water.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600
Otherwise, I fear I'd already be...

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.000
I already...

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.200
I already...

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.000
So you two are

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.440
the real adulterous couple.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.160
You even plotted to kill Datian.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.720
No, I... I'm not.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.000
I'm not, Datian.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.890
Datian, I'm not.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.880
Da Tian, I didn't do it.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.720
Get away, shameless.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.240
Tian Xifeng!

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.440
How can you be so cruel-hearted?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.560
I didn't.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.520
I didn't.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.320
Men, take these two at once

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.440
- to the County Yamen.
- No.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.320
- He's also an impostor.
- I didn't!

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.720
Why did you only arrest me?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.920

Take him away.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.560
Arrest him!

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.040
Arrest him!

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.320
There's some truth in that.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480
For the Fu Family,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.720
please don't hide the truth anymore.

Qingqing can't manage the household?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320
But an outsider

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.840
taking in charge...

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.360
That's just not proper.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.640
Let's not tell Tangbao, alright?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.760
She has no idea about any of this.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.800

Why make it harder for each other?
