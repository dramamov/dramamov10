[Episode 4]

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.260
Open it.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.900
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West Station.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.010
He's not here.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.140
I think he was here not too long ago.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.390
He's still not answering his phone?

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.590
I think he left it.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.720
His phone is off as well.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.570
- A record of that bus passing the highway gate just came in.
- Where is it?

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.860
Towards Ganghwa-do.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.380
Let's go.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.070
The fact that he left his phone means that he was prepared to avoid being tracked down by it.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.880
He's definitely committing another crime.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.060
He passed the tollgate about thirty minutes ago.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.750
Our window of opportunity is only an hour at most.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.410
It's him, isn't it?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.530
- The driver who said he saw the black backpack.
- Yes.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.550
But why

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.770
has he revealed himself for no apparent reason?

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.020
Because he knew we were looking for the owner of the backpack. He was trying to steer us toward Choi Ho Joon.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.290
He used the same backpack as Choi Ho Joon to prepare for this kind of situation.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.720
Don't follow. All of you wait out here.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.240
A-Ahjussi.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm sorry.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I was so drunk back then...

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.040
I'll apologize. I'll apologize sincerely.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.700
Please let me live.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.470
Why did you change your lipstick?

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.260
I liked the red one from last time.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.900
Don't let anyone in until the forensics team comes.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.280
Yes, sir.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.400
Is there anything in there?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.790
There's just some small blood spatter on the floor.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.030
The victim didn't die here.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.290
You asked for support from the main station, right?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.640
Yes. They'll be here soon.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.600
It hasn't been too long.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.950
Let's go in before it's too late.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
Let's split up starting around here.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.280
One second.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.220
Be careful, all of you. He has a weapon.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.510
We two will go this way. You guys go that way, two and two.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.480
Yes, sir. Good luck.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.710
Please.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.950
Don't be too scared.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.140
If you do as I say, nothing will happen.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.660
I'm really sorry.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.770
Just this once. Please forgive me just this once.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.680
If you know you messed up, that's good enough.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.580
Then...

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.300
you're letting me go?

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.100
I will.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.920
Really?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.280
Yes, thank you. I...

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.170
Really, it's all my fault,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.550
and I'm really regretting it.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.420
When I get out, I won't turn you in.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.180
So, please spare me.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.160
- Then, get up for now.
- Pardon?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.910
I said, get up. Don't make me angry. Quickly!

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.900
Turn around.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.260
Excuse me?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.620
Turn around and say what you did wrong.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.400
If I feel the sincerity of what you say, I'll turn around quietly and leave.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.510
Okay. Say what you did wrong.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.250
Without looking back. Start.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.470
At that time... I insisted on getting my way.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.280
I pressed the button late,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.110
but I said you saw it late,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.160
and you stopped the bus, but I didn't get off.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.180
And also speaking to you so rudely, I'm sorry about that too.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.080
And?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.590
And?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.790
Say how wrong you've lived your life.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.310
Okay.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.670
I've thought only of myself, and I caused problems for others.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.980
I... won't hastily look down on people anymore.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.580
I'll be really, really good from now on.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.560
Please... just this once, let me go just this once. Please.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.910
Everyone, gather around!

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.140
- Hurry and run along!
- Split up.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.710
- Go! Go!
- Watch your step.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.280
Help!

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.470
Quiet, quiet. Quiet.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.520
Quiet. Quiet down!

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.040
I should finish the job.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.780
Lee Seong Gon!

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.780
- Hyeongnim!
- Are you okay?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.450
How is she?

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.920
She's still alive.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.980
Move the victim down the hill first, hurry.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.810
Okay.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.390
We've secured the victim, and the culprit is on the run.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.520
Close off the whole mountain, and send in the rest of the crew.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.010
Move! Move!

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.150
- Flashlights high.
- Keep searching.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.970
Search thoroughly.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.030
- Hyeong, over there.
- Okay.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.850
Hyeong,

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.210
where?

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.970
Who is it? Hey.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.200
Hey.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.110
Come forward.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.160
- Who are you?
- Put your hands up.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.820
What's going on?

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.060
Don't move and put your hands up, you bastard!

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.130
"Don't move and put your hands up, you bastard!"

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.920
You crazy bastard.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.430
Oh, okay, okay.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.500
What's going on anyway?

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.900
- I didn't─
- Shut up.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.730
I didn't─

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.500
Sir, I didn't do anything. Nothing, nothing.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.030
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.330
We've arrested Lee Seon Gon.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.040
They are coming! They are coming!

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.300
Move, move.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.850
Get good footage!

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.850
Send it out, quickly!

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.370
One second, please!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.930
- Let go!
- He's getting off!

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.130
He's getting off! Getting off!

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.670
Is the police statement about him being the copycat true?

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.790
How is he connected to the previous case?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.680
- Did he commit another crime?
- What's your motive?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.230
Lee Seong Gon,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.470
don't try any bullshit. You're fine, aren't you?

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.930
I'm f-fine.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.380
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.740
Wh-Where am I?

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.620
Oh, this isn't my house.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.120
Who are you two?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.960
You don't know me?

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.290
I think I saw you before.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.000
Get it together.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.200
It's cold!

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.990
Lee Seong Gon, stop acting.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.600
You took a woman into the mountains using a bus.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.300
You even tried to run away on the mountain as well.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.610
It's not something that someone who isn't calculative can do.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.860
Stop messing around.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.130
I must've...

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:23.910
I must've done something again.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:29.200
What did I do this time?

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.780
You bastard.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.480
It's positive. That bastard actually did the drug.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.610
[DOA Test Results]

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.370
Ah, I remember now.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.450
It's because of that girl, right?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.840
Ahjussi, don't trust her.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.050
She made me like this.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.850
To get money.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.790
Because I look naive,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.050
she made it look like she was the victim.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.760
I've been taken advantage of by such mean people so many times.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.190
You are worse than a dog!

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.760
Think about the women who were unfairly hurt by you!

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.180
Is what you're saying something that a human would say? You are worse than a beast, you bastard!

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.050
Calm down. What are you going to do if this becomes a problem?

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.880
I don't care!

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.310
What's the problem if I treat an animal like an animal?

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.320
Do I need to treat this bastard like a human?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.390
Detective Byeon is right.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.870
He's making a move only after calculating every possibility.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.610
He will state that he was forced to confess in a state of psychological and physical distress.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.860
Interrogate him slowly. Give it time.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.940
Very...

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.630
slowly.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.280
What's with that detective bastard?

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.320
He messes with me?

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.210
Damn it.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.530
He's just a local copper.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.820
I'm Lee Seong Gon!

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.700
Lee Seong Gon, you bastard!

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.650
Can you make me some coffee?

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.500
Are you feeling better?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.360
Yes.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.310
What was wrong?

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.650
I was just sick.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.530
I'm asking what caused it?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.880
I'm always sick.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.560
Am I not allowed to worry about you?

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.100
You know, I'm dealing with a lot of stuff these days. Why are you adding to it?

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.880
Why did you meet with Michael Cha?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.620
I didn't have any specific reason. We didn't talk about much, either.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.400
We talked a bit about college and said goodbye.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.750
He's the chairman of McQueen Korea. There are a lot of connections with us.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.660
He's just a college friend to me.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.740
It's a sensitive time. You should be careful.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.750
Why do I have to be careful?

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.550
Are you saying that someone is suspicious of me?

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.000
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.580
I waited for you all night.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.540
I waited until yesterday morning before calling you.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.470
"I'm sick. I don't think I can come to work."

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.490
Those few words were all you said.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.140
You told me to wait,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.500
but you only showed up two whole days later.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.400
Shouldn't you at least explain yourself?

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.630
It's Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo, right?

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.890
Did he tell you to keep an eye on me?

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:00.930
I'm asking you. Explain yourself so I can accept it, even if it's an excuse.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.740
I'm asking you.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.130
Is Cheon Sang Woo the one who told you to keep an eye on me?

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.630
No.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.480
He's suspicious of me, no matter what I do.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.630
When we were young, even if I was just holding a fork at the table,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.740
he thought I was going to kill him with that fork.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.360
Just because...

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.410
I have a different mother than him.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.160
Try to forget the past.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.620
It's an emergency. You should support each other.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.090
When I was in middle school,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.390
do you know why I ran away to America?

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.600
He'd come to me and strangle me every night.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.720
I ran away because I felt like I was going to die. I wanted to survive.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.270
To whom can I say this kind of stuff in this family?

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.830
You're the only person I have.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.270
Thank you for the coffee.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.590
I'm sorry for not calling you.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.560
I suddenly got sick, so I didn't have a chance to.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.140
I felt bad that Jeong Hui Joo died.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.460
She was good at her job and smart.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.870
I'm sure you felt worse than I did, though.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.260
She was good at her job and smart.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.780
I'm sure you felt worse than I did, though.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.460
Team Leader.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.450
You took care of the laptop well, yes?

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.320
Yes, sir.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.550
I drove out and threw it in the Han River.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.750
Good job.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.860
And that should not be leaked outside.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.130
You and I are the only ones who know it. Okay?

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.180
Okay.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.200
I'm sorry for making you go through that.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.600
Should we eat dinner together?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.370
No,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.650
I have something planned today.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.460
Okay. You can go.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.840
Why did you ask me to do such an important task?

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.560
Because I trust you.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.370
Yes, Vice Chairman?

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.410
Understood. I'll come up.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.580
Did you look into what Na Na is up to these days?

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.150
Physically sick, didn't have time to worry about other things.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.910
Who was? You, or Na Na?

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.770
Na Na was?

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.770
Is that what Na Na said? That she couldn't do anything because she was sick?

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.940
She didn't tell me, but I'm always watching her.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.260
- Are you certain?
- Yes, I am.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.870
Do you really think you can look into Na Na's mind?

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.230
I can tell you one thing about Na Na.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.770
She doesn't know that she's lying even as she's lying.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.080
She's a person who believes her own lies as facts later on.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.150
I didn't know when I was young, either.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.610
Even if I pushed it, I was the one being scolded for bothering a sick person.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.350
Don't trust what she says,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.030
and watch the direction her feet are going.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.520
That's...

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.060
Na Na's truth.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.840
Yes?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.250
[TJ Board Member Cheon Na Na]

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.750
Welcome. Would you like some coffee?

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.170
Thank you.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.990
I am not sure if you remember.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.910
Has it been about two years?

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.900
When Oppa caused some trouble, there was a detective who came to visit Tae Ho.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.720
Do you know that detective?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.270
Yes. He was in my division.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.530
I'm sure it's who I'm thinking of.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.470
I remember him because he was very handsome for a detective.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.700
Why is he loafing around me?

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.820
Is there something he needs to find out from me?

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.730
I'll look into it.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.840
It's not like I have anything to answer even if he asked,

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.530
but it bothers me a bit.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.560
Don't worry. I'll take care of it on my own.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.770
It's a card you must hold to the very end to earn what you want.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.630
It shouldn't be shown to anyone.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.710
You know that, right?

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.690
Yes, I do.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.350
That cup is pretty, right?

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.810
The chairman bought it himself in Japan for me.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.650
I don't let just anyone use this cup.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.890
You probably already know, but our legal team takes care of all the trials related to the company.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.520
One of the most important roles outside of that, however,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.970
- is to protect the privacy of the head family.
- Oh, okay.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.200
Luckily, a job only you can do has just become available.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.950
But... I haven't quite learned this job yet.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.220
That's right.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.480
As a newly qualified intern, it will be your first given responsibility.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.230
Your success at this first job will be the criterion for judging you.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.630
I don't know if you're aware of this,

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.960
but the official transfer to the legal team is still pending.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.620
The higher-ups haven't given their approval yet.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.050
Okay. Leave it to me, Team Leader. I'll get it done no matter what.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.330
Okay.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.970
It's a simple job, no reason to feel pressured.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.470
Okay.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.050
The police are still searching for any evidence the culprit left.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:25.420
According to an authorized contact, he attempted to murder with the same method as the White Gown Serial Killer.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.750
However, the police still haven't presented their official statement

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.080
as to whether this is a copycat crime of the White Gown Serial Murder case.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.540
Are you awake?

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.410
Why did you do it? Why did you kill those women in such an awful way?

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.870
What was the reason?

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.400
What are you talking about?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.670
I didn't do that.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.120
I saw you in the woods.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.430
I saw you pointing a knife at the victim with my own two eyes.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.310
I'm sorry, I really can't remember.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.460
I admit that I did drugs.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.420
That was crazy of me.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.250
But I can't remember because I was drugged up. I'm telling you the truth.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.960
Wow, he has some thick skin.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.930
He says he doesn't even remember smashing his head against the bars.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.930
When did you start doing drugs?

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.910
I mean...

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.210
To be honest, she's not someone you can take on with a clear mind.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.720
Check the bus security camera. She caused such a disturbance.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.820
All the passengers saw it, too.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.860
I let it go, but if it were anyone else,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.920
they would have just...

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.570
If you look at the CCTV footage,

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.170
you guys would get angry too.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.210
People like that,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.980
they need to be punished harshly.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.000
Only then

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.620
do they know they messed up.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:01.520
To punish a girl who caused a disturbance, you took drugs and kidnapped her?

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.240
Yes.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.800
Then why did you put a white gown on the victim,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.740
and put lipstick on her?

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.980
Did I do that?

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.340
Oh, I'm crazy.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.810
Why did I do that?

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.330
Th-That... I saw it on the news.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.280
If I copied exactly what I saw on the n-news,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.500
I thought she would be more scared, so I did it.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.800
She thought I would really kill her, so she ran away, making it look bad.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.300
That's why you crushed your own head, isn't it?

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.130
You were trying to buy some time to think up something, right?

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.410
Have you changed your mind, now that you've been caught?

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.730
You didn't like that Kim Hyeong Bok became the serial killer.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.850
That's why you dragged Park Seon Mi's body to Jeong Hui Joo's murder scene.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.740
To announce that you were the real culprit.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.790
Because you have to be the real protagonist of the story,

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.770
but then some random guy became the hero.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.520
Isn't that right?

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.110
It's not too late.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.970
Tell us, confidently.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.070
That "everything came out of my head,"

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.100
and that "the police were no match for me."

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.220
You're...

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:33.560
not a fake that just copies someone else's crime, right?

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.600
Did you catch the culprit?

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.790
What?

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.770
I told you that the guy wearing the backpack on the bus is the perpetrator.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.040
You still couldn't catch him?

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.470
You couldn't catch him... You couldn't...

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.790
Hyeongnim, the MIU team leader is here.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.340
What?

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.250
What are you doing? Huh?

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.460
You're just trying to eat scraps from a finished meal!

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.950
This isn't just eating the scraps. It's like they're saying they'll take the entire table away.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.970
Be careful what you are saying.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.080
What? What? What?

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.170
Why are you managing the suspect so poorly?

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.630
He's not a suspect,

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.310
he's a criminal that's been caught at the scene.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.030
- He's the perpetrator.
- I have no time to play word games.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.840
I'll get to the point.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.720
Give him to us, and we won't hold you accountable for the poor management of the suspect.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.800
Wow, you really have quite a poor conscience.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.910
You're supposed to be the famous MIU. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.890
What did you say?

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.760
- Hey.
- Don't.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.930
Just because we're taking over doesn't mean we'll steal your credit for arresting the culprit.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.680
We're just asking for some time to investigate before he is sent to the prosecution.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.730
What, are we not capable of writing a report?

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.540
That's doable as long as you have fingers to use a keyboard.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.040
Take Lee Seong Gon.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.470
Hyeongnim...

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.530
After they get their staff assigned, remove our team members,

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.380
go to their office, and hand all the evidence we've collected over to MIU.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.650
What? Why should we?

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.280
No matter how you look at it, this is the MIU being unreasonable.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.710
It's fine.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:29.440
They've spent months without being able to go home or sleep because they were looking for the perpetrator.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.320
We should at least let them save face.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.170
However,

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.210
there's one condition.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.530
Lee Seong Gon is the real perpetrator.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.820
Admit that.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.880
To both Kim Hyeong Bok, who you've made into a murderer, and to his mother.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.080
Apologize formally.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.160
Okay.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.070
Let's go.

[Moon Bo Kyeong]

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.190
I heard that you were in a big accident two years ago.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.370
Yes, and?

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:16.130
I heard that you were recently mentally pressured in relation to that incident.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.870
Our legal team is here to help you with this.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:23.110
- Why?
- Honestly, I'm a newbie, so I can't explain in detail.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.530
They said that you will know why better than anyone else.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.990
What do I need to do?

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.670
The legal team will take legal action on your behalf.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.790

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.760
It explains that there was psychological damage, and you felt threatened.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.090
And the person who caused it

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.900
was Detective Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Station, correct?

What did the doctor say?
[MIU / Violent Crimes Unit]

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.350
We can't wait until then! Bring him as soon as possible.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.300
He looks fine to me.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.600
Detective!

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.740
What is it, Eoreusin?

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.220
I saw the news.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.620
I heard the perpetrator was caught. Is he the correct one?

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.770
We don't know yet.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.220
We're investigating. We'll call when it's certain, so go home and wait.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.010
Wait, please let me meet him.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.880
I told you we're investigating.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.500
If you keep bothering us, the investigation will be delayed.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.800
Then I'll wait until the investigation is over.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.700
We don't know when that will be.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.860
Go back please, I'll contact you, I said.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.400
This is the only thing I can do.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.770
Please let me wait here.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.850
Do whatever you want.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.610
Eoreusin, the victim's family is legally not allowed to meet with the perpetrator.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.550
But I won't do anything.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.020
I just want to know

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.570
if he did kill her and why! Just that!

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.780
I said you can't. Stop being persistent, and go home!

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.750
So then...

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.740
what do you think?

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.510
Is he the guy who killed Hui Joo?

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.250
I mean, everyone else is being patient. Why are you making such a fuss?

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.500
That person is my granddaughter!

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.350
Your granddaughter is not the only one who died.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.760
There will be an announcement on the media soon. Watch that.

Kick him out.

If he persists, tell him we'll arrest him for obstruction of business.

Sir, this isn't somewhere an unauthorized person can stay.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.710
Okay. I understand.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.240
Hey! Why did you give it to MIU? Why?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.270
It was originally their case.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.510
And they made a problem out of the fact that Lee Seong Gon hurt himself, so how could I not?

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.530
The chief is so excited that he's been practicing how he's going to give a media briefing!

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.980
How are we supposed to tell such a person that we handed the case over?

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.350
Just pretend you don't know.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:26.320

Oh Ji Hyeok, call me in about five minutes.

There aren't any special problems with the investigation, right?

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.950
Of course, not. We're collecting evidence well, and the motive for the murders will come out soon too.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.320
The confession is only a matter of time.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.300
Okay.

Thank you, Kang Do Chang.

Oh my, I didn't do that much. It's all your own luck.

What kind of bullshit is that?

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.820
Okay. Tell those bastards to stay where they are.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.930
- I mean, these bastards!
- What's going on?

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.870
It just doesn't make sense! Lee Seong Gon, who we caught,

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.590
they're stealing him. Does that make any sense?

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.670
- What?
- What's the reason?

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.560
There is no reason, they're just blinded by special promotions.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.680
I'm going to go and ruin them.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.080
Hey, calm down,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.030
and we should discuss this with the chief first.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.570
Honestly, the person who feels the worst right now is our chief.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.090
You're right. I only thought of myself.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.190
Chief, meet with the chief of MIU right away and protest.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.890
- Me?
- They're treating us like idiots!

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.380
That's right, Chief.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.000
They are looking at us like we're just some damn pushovers!

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.900
You have to go and object to this.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.920
Well, y-y-y-yes, that's right.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.080
But you guys, the chief of MIU is young in age,

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.810
but he has a higher rank than I, so─

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.190
Then meet with the commissioner! This is unfair!

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.620
You need to meet with the commissioner, and report in person!

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.980
The commissioner?

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.630
Chief, this isn't just the Violent Crimes Unit's problem; Incheon West Station's pride is on the line!

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.600
The chief of the MIU or the commissioner, whoever it is, you need to meet them in person and draw a conclusion!

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.580
Y-Y-Yes, that's true, but...

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:31.630
Hey, it's not like we're handing it over to foreign police, we're all Korean police.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.540
Aren't we overreacting?

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.510
N-No. Chief, you can't go soft like this!

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.580
Hey, hey, Team Leader Woo, we have to be calmer at times like this, and─

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.640
Chief, the special promotion of the entire Team 2 members is on the line.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.280
You have to protect us, Chief!

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.930
We put our trust in you!

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.670
Okay, I get it. I get it!

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.980
I'll... I'll take care of it, so you can go.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.280
Chief, this could be a flaw for the Incheon West Station.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.070
- It could last for a long─
- Team Leader, the chief says he'll take care of it.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.290
- You're the only one we have, Chief!
- Stop it.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.780
- Chief, to us, you are─
- Stop it.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.480
Stop it now, please.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.970
Do that then.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.120
Then we'll trust that you'll take care of it, and we'll get going.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.370
Chief, fighting!

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:20.950
Okay.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.090
Fighting! Fighting.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.170
Go ahead.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.490
- You need to listen to us─
- He heard it.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.700
You're good.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.100
- Am I? I'm very good.
- Yes.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.650
Ah, those bastards.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.090
They stole that...

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.400
Aigoo!

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.510
What did the chief say? Didn't he throw a fit?

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.630
Of course, he did!

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:50.440
This will be a piece of work. He's going to be on our asses to get the case back.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.720
Who? The chief?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.000
He's in the palm of my hand.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.500
I took care of it perfectly so that he won't say anything else!

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.030
If the chief says something, come and tell me. The chief...

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.540
is in my palm. My palm.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.280
Did you try calling Lee Seong Gon's company?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.460
Yeah, there was a person who recently visited Lee Seong Gon.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.960
I'm going to get the details when I get there.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.630
Okay, go.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.280
Detective Oh, phone call.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.430
Yes, this is Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.170
Yes.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:20.170
Is it an urgent matter?

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.490
Okay, let's meet up for a bit then. Where are you?

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:23.890
Yes, I know.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.860
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.350
Who is that? That voice sounds familiar.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.630
Who was it?

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.450
Was it someone related to our case?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.450
It's Chief Moon's daughter.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.870
Right, that was the voice.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.370
I'll be out for a bit. Thirty minutes should be enough.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.880
Okay, go. Hey!

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.650
Be careful. She's the chief's daughter.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.390
If things go awry with the chief, we're out right away.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.000
Don't send your suspicious eye gazes.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.050
That gaze of yours is the most dangerous.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.120
Crazy bastard.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.170
Hyeong, could the handsome detective that the chief's daughter mentioned possibly not be you, but─

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:08.090
Hey! It was me she had a thing with, not Detective Oh Ji Hyeok!

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.250
Oh, right. That's right.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.050
She saw Detective Oh at the chicken restaurant. She saw him.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.280
Is that so?

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.890
I gave her a piggyback, and Detective Oh... She just saw his face for a second, a second, and...

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.150
Because it's hard to tell me directly,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.110
she's using people around me to confirm my feelings.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.420
Don't I know women? Women are like this.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:34.570
Hey, Man Goo. Honestly, from an objective point of view, for the face... is it Kwon Jae Hong or Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.220
Oh Ji Hyeok all the way. Undoubtedly.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.280
You're just oblivious, but my kind of face is more popular among women.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.120
This is the reality.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.370
Crazy bastard.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.560
Get it together.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.360
Hello.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.800
Yes, hello.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.100
What can I do for you?

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.750
Are you really Detective Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.370
Yes. I'm Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.540
I'm in the middle of investigating a case, so I don't have much time.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.950
Can you just tell me what this is about?

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.400
Here, read this over,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.480
and if you approach Ms. Kim Min Ji again, call her, or send an email,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.460
you're going to go to court.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.600
[Request for Restraining Order]

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.840
I heard that you're a part of the TJ Group.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.900
Was this ordered by them?

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.930
You said you were busy.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.090
I don't have time to explain.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.120
Just don't approach her and nothing will happen.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.990
Nothing good would come from you being caught up in a legal problem like this, right?

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.500
I don't care about that.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.570
A-Anyway,

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:11.530
you work at the station where my father is. You can see how troublesome it is for me to be in the middle, so please─

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.460
What kind of job do you do in TJ?

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.580
I'm in the legal team.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.680
It's just a job. It's not like...

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.540
Don't take it too... personally.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.740
Legal team. Then the team leader is Woo Tae Ho,

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.850
department lead is Choi Yong Geun.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.750
Don't think about that stuff and just

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.830
don't get close to Ms. Kim Min Ji.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.290
I'll head out since you said you're busy.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.560
Hey,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.840
why did Bo Kyeong want to see you?

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.150
It's nothing big.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.800
What is it? Is it personal?

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.990
Not at all.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.470
You know that one of the victims, Jeong Hui Joo, was a legal team member of the TJ Group, right?

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.180
I do.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.320
Wait a minute, now that I think about it, Bo Kyeong works at one of TJ's companies.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.870
I think Moon Bo Kyeong has taken Jeong Hui Joo's vacant seat.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.410
What? Was it a coincidence?

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.270
It's a planned coincidence.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:36.350
Someone pushed Moon Bo Kyeong into the seat that Jeong Hui Joo was in.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.010
Who did?

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.190
I'll see you around.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.790
Cheon Na Na.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.650
The TJ Group Planning Director and the chairman's only daughter.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.440
Probably the former team leader of MIU, Choi Yong Geun, is related to it too.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.150
He's the department lead for the TJ Group's legal team now.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.110
What about them?

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.250
It's complicated.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.950
Do you want me to explain right now?

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.040
Never mind.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.800
It's a lot just dealing with Lee Seong Gon.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.540
Yes, Eoreusin?

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.330
No, go ahead.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.840
I apologize for bothering you again.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.290
Can I meet you now, by any chance?

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.500
I'm on my way out for some work.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.310
So then, I'll go and wait at the station.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.570
Is it urgent?

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.220
No.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.010
I'm just frustrated.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:35.120
I also have some things that I want to know about Hui Joo's case.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.700
Well, then, I'll send you an address, so you can head there.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.220
I'll come there as soon as I'm done.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.920
Yes, yes, thank you.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.860
Jeong Hui Joo.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:55.640
Why does it feel like the Jeong Hui Joo case is separate?

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.620
He was too skillful.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:05.830
It was like... there was an order that he decided on.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.400
He didn't look nervous or hesitant at all.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.990
Just... it felt like killing people was just an everyday thing for him.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.110
- Detective.
- Yes?

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.470
There's no chance of me running into him, right?

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.660
Yeah, well, that won't happen.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.120
I'm scared.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.040
The fact that his face was the same as if we were on the bus makes me even more scared.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.190
He had that casual look on his face even when he held that knife to kill me!

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.160
I keep remembering it,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.660
his face looking at me with no emotion.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.480
I understand.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.630
Go home and rest for now, and we'll contact you if we need anything.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.540
What do you think?

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.260
Just as you blabbed at the media...

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.690
Is Lee Seong Gon a copycat criminal?

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.820
Before he's sent to the prosecution,

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.500
come to an agreement with Lee Seong Gon, no matter what.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.400
Like you claimed,

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.680
he needs to become a copycat.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.150
It's not a bad deal for Lee Seong Gon, either.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.360
Come to an agreement

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.350
about the situation, okay?

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.010
Lee Seong Gon's younger sister?

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.720
Yes. That's what they said.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.400
Lee Seong Gon is an orphan, so he wouldn't have any family, though.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.510
That's what I thought, too,

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.290
but was it about a month ago?

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.750
She came to visit Lee.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.710
She couldn't speak Korean well, so someone translated on the side.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.520
In my opinion,

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.380
I think she was adopted to a foreign country.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.240
Her name was in English, too.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.300
Do you remember it by any chance?

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.010
How would I remember an English name?

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.930
O-One second, please.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:58.780
But... I might have the phone number of the person who was translating at the time.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.470
She asked to give Driver Lee her contact.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.910
You know him, right? The person named Lee Seong Gon.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.530
Do you know Lee Seong Gon?

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.960
I'm sorry, but could you give us some privacy?

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.040
Pardon? Well, but this person cannot speak any Korean.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.310
What are you planning to do? She can't communicate.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.110
Some personal matters might come up.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.980
It might be better if she stayed outside.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.890
Hyeong, we could use the translator, but you had to show off.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.890
She's on medical care due to a stress-induced disorder.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.470
Try to avoid mentioning things that could cause her shock.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:44.520
I understand.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:53.210
So, you've met Mr. Seong Gon Lee, right?

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:58.610
And he's the brother you were separated from when you were little?

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.090
I'm not sure.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.880
We couldn't talk much because he didn't speak English, but

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.260
I think he didn't like the idea that I came to see him.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.480
What did you talk about?

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.260
Did he mention anything about himself,

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.150
about his condition?

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.480
I know you've been hospitalized for stress disorder.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.520
Did something happen during that encounter?

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.650
Yeah.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.430
Mr. Lee is currently locked up.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.750
He's charged with a series of murders.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.690
Did he happen to mention anything to you?

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.750
Hey, the lady asked us not to say anything that could shock her.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:50.860
Did you understand that?

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.370
Are you looking down at me?

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.340
Murder. Murder.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.690
M, U, R... Murder. Murder.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.430
She's shaken because you mentioned murder.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.270
I'm sorry.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.380
He and I... We're not actual siblings.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.720
When I was little, my mom got divorced and got remarried.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.240
My stepdad had a son, and that's who Seong Gon is.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.940
We're not blood related, at all.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.580
The only reason why I wanted to find him was because

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.970
I-I needed some kind of a trace from when I was in Korea,

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.940
because I thought this would be my last visit ever

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.010
to this country.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.170
Are you trying to say

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.910
that you have no emotional connection with him?

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:38.260
Now, or in the past?

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.390
But you did have some kind of conversation.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:46.250
He didn't mention anything?

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.740
Like I said, he doesn't know English, I...

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.540
I don't know much Korean either.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.960
And to be honest, I really don't want to talk about him.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.190
You understand, don't you?

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.580
What did she say?

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.280
I think she doesn't want to talk about it.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:21.230
She heard something from Lee Seong Gon.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:23.020
She's hiding something.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.820
Did you understand her English?

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.550
There are times when a person's facial expressions are more truthful than their words.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.890
Anyway, it looks like she needs more time.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:39.770
Let's go to Lee Seong Gon, and mention his younger sister.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.910
Let's see what kind of reaction he shows.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.710
Are you sure? Didn't you say you were going to meet with Mr. Jeong In Beom tonight?

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.950
Even if I met with him right now, I'd have nothing to tell him.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.880
If I get a grip,

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.770
I'll tell him then.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.240
I don't think we'll get any more customers.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.970
You can go home.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.110
No, it's okay. I'll help you with the rest and go home.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:17.540
If Oppa sees me holding you this late, he'll foam at the mouth.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.540
Go home and just help Jae Woong with his homework.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.900
Okay. Got it.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.600
Yes, Oppa.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.360
Oh, him?

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.250
He's here.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:33.780
Why?

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.380
I'm heading out then.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.560
Okay. And also, if Jae Woong says he wants to eat something at night, tell him no.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.340
He eats too much at night.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.680
Okay.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.180
[Ttobongee Chicken]

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.920
Sir.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.950
Yes?

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:14.520
My brother called, and he's busy with the investigation. He said he'd meet you next time.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.710
Oh, I see.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.600
I'm so sorry.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.080
He felt so sorry to call you himself,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.020
so he said he'll contact and meet you later for sure.

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.620
I understand.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:34.300
It's because I unfairly asked to meet him when he's so busy, so tell him that it's really okay.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.180
How much is this?

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.450
N-N-No. Just go.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.830
And this.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.990
Take this home and enjoy it with your family.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:46.630
No, don't do that. I'll pay for what I ate, too.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:50.830
No, I can't, I can't. If I took money from you, my brother would really scold me.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.890
Thank you.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.400
Hey, how disloyal of you to be released by yourself. I heard you're friends with a detective.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.280
Charm him well, and get Yoo Na out too,

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.050
if you want to keep your pretty face.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.970
Oh my.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.780
Here.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.890
Try these.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.710
No, I'm okay. I can go in these slippers.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:41.630
I'm giving this to you instead of paying my bill to the chicken restaurant lady.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:46.150
If you wear these, I'll feel like a weight lifted off my chest.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.370
Try them on to see if they fit.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.080
They fit, right?

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.080
Yes. They fit perfectly. That's amazing.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:11.190
I lived looking at people's feet my whole life, so I know the size after looking only once.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:14.090
Do you dislike the design or something?

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.790
No, not at all.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:18.180
It's so pretty. Thank you.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.540
Okay. Enjoy them.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.590
That's all I need. That's all.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.350
Okay.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.240
Aren't I finished meeting with you two?

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.320
I heard that the higher-ups took the case.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.070
You...

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:49.200
had a sister that you were separated from when you were young, right?

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.860
It looked like she knew a bit about you.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.940
What did that bitch say?

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.010
She is a different type of person compared to you.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.860
She's nice.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.950
She looks so nice.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.900
You can't judge a person by how they look.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.740
You don't know what her past was like.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.180
What was her past like?

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.970
Just tell her if you meet her again.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:24.110
To live with what I said in her mind.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.150
Do you remember me?

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:03.550
I'm sorry. I can't speak Korean very well.

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:06.640
I understand. You've probably wanted to forget.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.290
Why are you here?

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.830
Nice to meet you.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.650
I'm asking you why you're here!

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.400
You should've been happily living in America. Why did you come here?

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400
I'm sorry.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.160
I can't speak Korean that well.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.560
What can we do?

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.200
I can't speak English because I'm not educated.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.310
Oppa.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:25.530
What?

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.360
Why am I your oppa?

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.840
I missed you.

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.350
I'm asking why I'm your oppa, you crazy bitch.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.390
Why am I your oppa? Huh?

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.680
Do you remember this?

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.300
This is what your whore-like mother carried around.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:03.000
My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong...

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.430
- What are you saying? Talk in a way I can understand!
- and I should love, above all things.

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:07.850
I firmly intend, with your help─

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:11.240
I said to speak in a way I can understand instead of blabbing American!

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.580
And to forgive whatever leads me to sin, suffer, and die─

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.400
You crazy bitch.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.460
Hey, American...

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.170
Were you so very happy living in America?

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:22.610
Was it heaven?

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.420
It... it was hell for me.

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:29.810
I lived my whole life because I couldn't die, you crazy bitch!

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:33.040
Hey, you...

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.140
you... you and...

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.150
if you and your mom just hadn't shown up,

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.300
my father wouldn't have died like that, and

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.710
I wouldn't have lived like this!

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:45.070
- I firmly intend─
- Stop it!

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:49.270
- You crazy bitch.
- to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid.

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:51.630
I'm sorry for my sins with all my heart.

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:57.650
In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good...

00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.650
Do you know why I became a killer?

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.600
I've killed countless people.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.750
Because I kept remembering your mom's face whenever I saw a woman.

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.320
Wearing a white gown,

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.430
with red lipstick on,

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.820
and shaving men's faces, that face.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.110
The face of your mom.

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.140
You...

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.590
It's good that you came to me.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:31.920
I'm not going to kill you.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.000
I'm going to let you live.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.850
Remember this well.

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:41.580
With this, as I... as I kill each person,

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.320
you...

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.670
need to feel pain like hell.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:54.990
Those people are dying because you're alive.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.950
Remember that.

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.870
My God.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.900
I'm sorry.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.200
It's all my fault.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.800
All my fault.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.130
How are things with Tae Ho lately?

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.870
Good.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:28.260
Sure.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.970
It's a marriage you insisted on, so hold hands until the end.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:36.530
The chairman trusts Tae Ho more than he trusts me. He doesn't need me to hold his hand.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.520
Don't you think he grew too much?

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.150
We're married.

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.960
That's right.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.480
There's nothing bad in your point of view, is there?

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.330
You're aware that there was a search and seizure of the legal team before the chairman was sentenced to prison, right?

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:55.800
That bastard.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.470
He's saying that the crucial evidence that caused Father to be sentenced to prison came from the Blue House.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.620
But what if that evidence

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.070
found in the search and seizure,

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:11.450
was data that was sent over to the prosecution from our legal team?

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.880
You know he's thorough. He doesn't make mistakes like that.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.520
What if it was on purpose and not a mistake?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520
Why would he?

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.890
You said it yourself, he grew too much.

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:24.420
Maybe he wants to get even bigger.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.030
I met with Michael Cha not too long ago, the McQueen Korea chairman.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:31.740
Oh, you did?

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.800
He's my college friend, so he talked honestly.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.530
He knew about the devastating loss from the business that you tried to start up in Japan.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.230
Dad doesn't know, right?

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:46.920
And he doesn't know that Team Leader Oh helped bury the trouble you caused two years ago.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.400
If Woo Tae Ho was thinking in a bad way, shouldn't the chairman know those facts already?

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.910
Why don't you tell him? You know it all.

01:01:56.910 --> 01:02:00.850
We're family, the same bloodline.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.340
Yeah. That's right.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:12.130
There's no one to trust but your own bloodline.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.570
This cup is something your mom was very fond of, right?

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:27.850
Are you keeping this because it reminds you of your mom?

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.290
It's pretty.

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:37.170
It's been a while since I saw Father.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.640
Let's go visit him as siblings, holding hands.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.750
Okay. Contact me after choosing a time.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:03:00.080
Remain with your seat belt fastened and all of your luggage stowed until the captain has brought the aircraft to a complete stop at the gate.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.010
Don't forget the fasten seat belt sign.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.470
Yes, Mom.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.810
Are you on the plane?

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.160
Yeah, we're taking off soon. I'll call you when I arrive.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.800
Na Na, once you go to America, don't come back.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.450
Run away.

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.210
Open the door.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.370
Stop playing tricks and open the door!

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.100
I know what you're thinking.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.630
I know that you're only doing this for money!

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.550
I won't let that happen.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:37.250
I won't! Give up and open the door!

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.880
Na Na, you can't come back.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.420
You can't come back to this hell.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.720
At least you should be the one to survive.

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:47.610
You should be the one.

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.150
Mom,

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:52.270
are you okay? Is something going on?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.900
I won't run away like my mother.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.100
I'm going to survive

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.670
until the very end.

Lee Seong Gon must've told his crimes to Laura Kane.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.800
You'll be remembered forever as the protagonist of a rare serial murder case that spawned a copycat.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.090
Who's this person that's been digging into my weaknesses?

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:18.090
The chairman would never let go of Cheon Sang Woo's hand.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:19.640
We will change the face of TJ.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.380
Tell me. That I'm not fighting all alone.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.340
All you need to say is that you kidnapped a person after doing drugs.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.910
Even if he is the real culprit, I can't answer!

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:30.660
I think I was being selfish.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.320
Jeong Hui Joo was never on that bus. Why is that?
