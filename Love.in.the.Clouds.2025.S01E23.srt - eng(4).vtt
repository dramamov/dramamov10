Ming Yi,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.420
do you remember

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.290
what you were like when you first won the Qingyun Tournament?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.900
You were incredible back then,

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.570
- invincible across all Six Realms. - Stop it.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.700
It's my fault.

don't cry.

If you ever miss me,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.220
bring me some dried fish.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.330

I'm sorry.

I was wrong.

what happened to Ming Yi?

don't be afraid.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.010
I will find a way to save you.

I know a way to make His Lordship forget Ming Yi!

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.090
Your Lordship,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.380
this scroll that Ming Yi gave you

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.770
was indeed altered by a Yaoguang spell,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.330
but I don't have the skill

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.140
to restore the original text.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.570
"Yaoguang Mountain, Zhushui Spiritual State, and Flowing Wave Gorge,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.460
the entire Upper Third Realm was part of that.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.730
Lord Hanfeng kept a list of names

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.900
to control them."

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.420
Your Lordship,

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.730
she's from Yaoguang Mountain.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.810
At the end of the day, she's on their side.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.140
Before Fairy Bo died, she made you promise

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.250
never to let

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.700
the Golden Millet Dream appear in the world.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.810
It seems she foresaw

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.330
how far human greed would go

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.330
for the medicine.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.140
It can't be helped.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.980
Be it Mu Qibai

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.140
or those from Yaoguang Mountain who took part,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.660
none of them was the true culprit.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.730
The Emperor of Zhushui

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.490
was the first to strike at the Bo clan,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.660
and he's been secretly controlling Mu Qibai ever since.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.090
I must not let the tragedy

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.700
that befell my master and the innocent

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.380
happen again.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.900
Your Lordship, if you intend to go after the Emperor of Zhushui,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.490
I'll be right by your side.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.530
But...

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.700
your health matters most.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.330
Please, have something to eat first.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.980
Master She,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.660
that's what happened.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.900
I've told you everything about my past with Ming Yi.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.290
You can trust me.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.570
Silly child,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.530
how could you use your spiritual veins like that?

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.620
Master She, I heard you once fought as a warrior

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.010
and later became a physician.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.700
You must understand Ming Yi's condition better than anyone.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.940
Ming Yi once suspected

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.250
that Zhushui Spiritual State's Soul-seizing Technique

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.940
might suppress the Heavenly Grief.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.530
I searched the old texts and found

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:27.530
that it wasn't the technique alone that restrained the aftereffects.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.490
When those of Zhushui Spiritual State

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.770
used the technique,

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.010
they channeled their spiritual power directly into her spiritual veins.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.620
That was what suppressed Heavenly Grief's aftereffects.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.860
But only

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.010
people from Zhushui Spiritual State know this method.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.460
Very well.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.810
I'll storm the Zhushui Palace,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.290
catch a few men there,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.660
and force them to cast the spell to save her.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.940
So all it takes is to inject spiritual power

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.770
into her spiritual veins using Zhushui's secret art?

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.700
Yes.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.100
[A cloud of pear blossoms and a forlorn dream]

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.940

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.660
Tell me, who are you?

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.050
Master.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.530

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.220
Ming Yi.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.810
Ming Yi.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.290
Master.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.010
How do you feel?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.620
Immortal Situ would never harm me. Don't hurt him.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.010
Do you know

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.420
he is from Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.250
You didn't tell me the truth?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.530
No.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.460
But if you'd cared about me a little more,

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.250
you would've remembered

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.900
which realm's robe I wore

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.730
the day we first met.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.330
You never asked me,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.420
so I supposed

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.140
my background

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.730
didn't matter to you.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.010
Ming Yi,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.780
you really don't remember.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.170
Otherwise, you would've known

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.420
that I wore a robe

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.010
common across the Six Realms that day.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.420
I guessed right.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.460
Why did you

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.530
come to Jixing Abyss?

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.300
The Golden Millet Dream.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.980
The Golden Millet Dream?

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.940
In Zhushui Spiritual State, might makes right.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.380
Without spiritual veins,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.650
I could only

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.490
live like a servant there.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.300
So I escaped to seek the Golden Millet Dream.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.940
That is all.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.780
But Ming Yi,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.380
after we met again,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.780
I gave up any thought

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.380
of taking the Golden Millet Dream for myself.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.170
I'll go to Ji Bozai now

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.690
and bring the Golden Millet Dream to you.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.940
Don't go!

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.300
You must not go.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.460
Don't go.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.260
- Ming Yi. - Ming Yi.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.170
Ming Yi.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.460
Don't go to him.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.420
Even now, you're still

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.380
acting in his interest?

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.780
The Golden Millet Dream is the only cure for you.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.940
If he refuses to give it,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.310
I will kill him and take it!

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.820
Ji Bozai doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.090
He spread false news

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.210
to lure

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.570
those who covet it.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.490
He never had the antidote.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.260
He doesn't have it?

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.210
Then what should we do?

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.980
What else can I do?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.610
How can I save you?

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.170
Your Highness.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.340
Why are you here?

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.650
I came to report on the recovery

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.260
of those injured in the battle with the netherbeasts.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.210
Everyone within the Jixing Palace has recovered.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.610
The prescriptions

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.530
sent to Huansha Market for the common folk have also taken effect.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.010
The warriors at Shouhua Academy

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.130
are nearly all healed

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.340
and can resume training tomorrow.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.260
Is there anything else?

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.980
No, Your Highness.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.610
I'll take my leave.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.210
Yan Xiao.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.420
You're always like this.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.900
You feared my father would be in danger,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.490
so you chose to lie to me.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.740
You feared my uncle would harm me,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.490
so you allied with Ji Bozai while keeping me in the dark.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.940
You always do what you think is best for me,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.010
but you've never once asked me

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.260
if that's what I truly want.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.130
I just...

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.690
I just wanted to protect you.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.090
Protect me?

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.300
Your Highness.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.860
Your Highness, why are you crying?

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.090
Did someone hurt you?

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:35.980
Tell me.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.010
I'll go teach them a lesson.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:43.210
Jixing Abyss lost at the Qingyun Tournament again.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.900
Once again, we get no Blessed Rain.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.530
Look,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.860
my Blessing Flowers are withering.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.490
Back when the Empress was alive,

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.860
she planted these with the Emperor.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.690
I promise I'll heal them for you.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.650
Xiao!

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.260
The Blessing Flowers have bloomed!

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.610
How did you do it?

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.570
Without the Blessed Rain's nourishment,

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.260
how could they bloom?

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.940
The ways of healing are universal.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.940
Curing plants isn't much different from curing people.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.460
But

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.090
isn't it difficult

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.210
to make them bloom without the Blessed Rain?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.090
No,

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:54.980
not at all.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.650
This isn't protection.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.530
It's just you doing what you think is right.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.090
Just like this.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.900
Blessing Flowers wither

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.940
after the Prayer Night

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.650
and bloom again the following year.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.980
But this pot, the one my mother left me,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.460
has bloomed all year round.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.380
I once thought

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.940
you'd found some special herb or artifact to sustain it.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.740
Only today did I find out

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.610
you'd been feeding it with your own blood.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.260
Your Highness, you're back.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.380
It's the only thing the Empress left you.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.530
I didn't want you to feel sad watching the flowers wither.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.530
But if this is the price,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.260
do you really think I'd still want that?
