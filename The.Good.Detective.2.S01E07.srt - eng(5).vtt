Na Na! Na Na!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.730
The needle in the drawer.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.620
Drawer...

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370
Will you be okay?

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.850
Yeah. I'm okay.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.930
I was so busy that I missed the timing a bit. I'll be okay.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.170
This has never happened before.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.730
Let's go to the hospital and get you checked.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.230
Tae Ho,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.600
I need you.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.780
You know it better than anyone else.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.770
Those people

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.470
won't leave me alone.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.470
Especially my brother.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.420
I don't know what he might do.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.100
I'm scared.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.440
Na Na, Cheon Sang Woo isn't the problem right now.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.220
When I was in America by myself, do you know how scared I was?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.500
I couldn't go home.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.630
I stayed at hotels and even changed them every day

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.660
in case my brother might come and kill me.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.230
Na Na.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.550
You're very sensitive right now. If you rest a bit...

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.630
Let's send Cheon Sang Woo away...

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.590
to where dad is right now.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.580
The case from two years ago, assault and battery, attempted murder.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.810
If that is revealed, he will rot in jail for a few years.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.790
It's a closed case.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.200
No. There's a detective who's still chasing that. It's possible.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.650
Na Na.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.150
That case has something to do with me too.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.300
If Cheon Sang Woo goes to jail, I go too.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.340
All you did was help him.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.030
Tampering with evidence at most. Can't you just get released without receiving any sentencing, Mr. Prosecutor?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.320
It will collapse. Everything.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.910
We need to build things anew.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.220
You and me,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.740
together.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.560
Chairman, if Director Cheon is missing from her seat at a time like this─

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.400
It's better not to have her here.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.990
Let's send Cheon Sang Woo away... to where Dad is right now.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.490
We need to build things anew.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.830
You and me,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.530
together.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.440
Explain who these characters are.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.210
- Who are they?
- The person who dragged the woman away is Cheon Sang Woo, TJ Group's vice chairman.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.630
The person on the screen right now is Woo Tae Ho, leader of the legal team and the son-in-law of the highest-ranked leader.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.400
Why did you get this kind of thing when we're investigating the Jeong Hui Joo case?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.850
This is a case I was chasing when I was in the MIU.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.200
If I had got this video back then, we would've arrested Cheon Sang Woo.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.670
Then, well... go back to the Seoul MIU.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.180
Go there, and take care of that.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.390
Why did you bring such a nuclear bomb to us, who have nothing to do with it? Why?

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.140
What's certain is that this video is connected to the motive for murdering Jeong Hui Joo.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.180
Then are you saying that the killer of Jeong Hui Joo could be one of the two people from earlier?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.590
There's a high possibility.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.890
This is on a different level than the one before. Honestly, they're too big.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.560
They aren't just big. They're super, super, super big!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.830
If we act on this prematurely, we'll all be ruined!

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.960
There won't even be a bone of us left! We'll be powder, just super powder!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.630
You sent that person, didn't you?

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.030
Why did you have that? You said you just saw it. Then why...

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.650
Why did you have that?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.650
Did you try to kill me by sending that person?

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.510
I just sent him to check it

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.570
because I felt like you might have some random things related to me, and I was right.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.160
You were holding a knife to my back.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.030
Because I needed at least one of those things to survive.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.850
I had it to survive.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.830
Did you show it to anyone else, or no?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.090
No.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.190
I have no one to show it to.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.320
Anyway, about getting you hurt,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.190
I'm sorry about that.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.360
He didn't do it because I told him to.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.890
Now you know, right?

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.740
Soo Yeon and I, don't touch either of us.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.390
Min Ji, you messed up first! This is all because of your greed!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.960
This might cut the string that connects you to me.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.160
Hold onto that string, no matter what.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.590
If you let go, the connection between you and that child will be cut too.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.440
Remember that.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.680
Put it here, here!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.790
You lowly bitch.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.930
You!

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.250
Dirty bitch!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.450
Let me live. Please, let me live.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.350
You...

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.460
how dare you?

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.890
How dare you?

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.310
Why is it my child? Why?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.210
It's just yours. Your kid!

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.060
Come here. Just your dirty bloodline!

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.970
I have nothing to do with it!

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.020
Die! Die! Die!

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.180
Please let me live.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.250
Let me live. Let me live.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.270
Let me live.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.450
You said you quit drinking. Did you start again?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.070
Sit down for a bit.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.660
Drinking doesn't help with your under-performing business.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.590
The business is going great. It has found its base.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.460
Then why are you drinking? It's more dangerous to drink when the business is going well.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.090
Today,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.330
I was curious about Eun Hye's GED results, so I called.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.350
- Did she fail?
- It would've been better if she had.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.670
They said she didn't even show up.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.900
The day she said she went to the exam, she went somewhere else.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.210
- What?
- All the studying was just a pretense.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.630
What are you talking about? Eun Hye isn't that kind of person.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.880
- Then why wouldn't she take the test?
- Did you ask Eun Hye why she did that?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.080
If she were my daughter, I would've already broken her legs.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.220
But she's not.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.680
I thought, "What right do I have to meddle in her life?"

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.840
How far should we care for Eun Hye? How much should we ask for her to do? I just don't know.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.840
We're Eun Hye's parents. We need to scold her when we have to!

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.100
Oppa, I think you're the problem.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.200
What about me? What did I do?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.950
Eun Hye wasn't a person who was suited for studying.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.770
Because you keep holding expectations for her, she's just been playing along.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.140
So,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.290
let's just let this slide.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.230
Let's have her work at the restaurant a bit more and let her go her way once she gets a little older.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.570
That might be what's good for her.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.820
- Who do you think you are?
- Please be quiet.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.830
Who do you think you are to judge Eun Hye like that?

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.240
Eun Hye is super smart, and she's so good at drawing. Why would we let that talent rot?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.980
What's this got to do with talent? The environment she grew up in was just not good.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.250
She's far from studying.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.390
It's not something you can force.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.520
From now on,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.460
if you make her work at the chicken restaurant, I'm going to kill you.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.930
She shouldn't do anything but study, understood?

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.480
Eun Hye! Eun Hye!

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.190
Eun Hye why on earth did you─

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.460
Please be a bit quieter.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.830
Jae Woong, you need to sleep in your room. Wake up.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.060
Come on.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.630
I'll put Jae Woong to sleep, so stay here for a bit.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.290
Okay. Go ahead.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.120
[GED Compiled]

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.920
Eun Hye, why didn't you go to the exam?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.720
I'm sorry.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.710
How can I look at your father's face later if you keep going off the tracks?

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.480
That bastard.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.030
The bastard who took your money. Because you hang out with guys like that you─

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.210
I heard you talking to Ahjumma.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.660
She's right.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.100
I really don't want to study.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.210
Who studies because they like to? People do it to benefit their own lives.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.750
Do I have the right to?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.710
Why wouldn't you?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:51.930
Ahjussi, living with you, Ahjumma, and Jae Woong

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.710
makes me so happy, and I like it.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.620
But since I think you're having a hard time

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.940
because I'm around... it's so hard to endure.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.880
I'm really nothing.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.870
I must've put too much pressure on you.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.580
There are other exams.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.930
You can take it in another six months.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.270
Once more. Let's try just once more.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.780
Okay. I'll think about it.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.150
You've cried too much up to now.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.950
You can stop crying now.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.200
Why are you telling me that now?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.260
Why did you hide it until now? I misunderstood Eun Hye for no reason!

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.960
I did it because I was worried you would cause a big problem.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.660
Investigation or whatever doesn't matter. How dare they unfairly accuse Eun Hye.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.830
Jang Yoo Na, that damn girl. I'll...

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.270
She already went to court and to jail.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.080
Then that detective... How dare he take Eun Hye?

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.400
Especially when she was about to take an exam!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.960
That detective got rid of the accomplice charge against Eun Hye.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.450
He added the charge of perjury to Jang Yoo Na too.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.870
Now that I think about it, you anger me the most.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.980
Why did Eun Hye call you in that situation? Huh?

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.880
I was suspicious of you. Ever since she brought you to the police substation, something felt off!

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.570
- Why would she reach out to you before me?
- Gosh.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.210
I must be easy for her to talk to!

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.500
Why is it you that's easy to talk to? She should be seeing me as more comfortable and easy!

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.860
Why are you yelling in the morning? As if you didn't cause enough trouble!

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.280
Hey, don't you two know that you're waiting for transfers?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.330
Shouldn't you be keeping your heads down on purpose?

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.410
If you keep making a fuss like this, what would that make me?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.450
I understand. I'm sorry.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.040
Hey, Kang Do Chang.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.000
Hey, I'm really worried.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.230
Kwon Jae Hong, that guy wouldn't secretly meet with my Bo Kyeong, would he?

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.310
No way. Why would someone like Bo Kyeong like someone like Jae Hong?

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.100
Right?

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:40.190
That's right. Even if she doesn't have a good eye for men, a guy that just looks like a grilled anchovy head, she wouldn't...

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.300
Wait a moment.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:54.020
The day Bo Kyeong was drunk, Oh Ji Hyeok, you were at that chicken restaurant too, right?

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.380
Yes, but it was just for a moment.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.640
Are you the one that Bo Kyeong said was handsome?

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.620
I have a favor to ask.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.770
I'm really desperate.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.220
What is it?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.500
Bo Kyeong, how did you get her into a renowned college?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:20.420
If she has your DNA, she couldn't have even gotten close to it, how on earth did you get her in?

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.090
Out of nowhere...

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.820
Are you thinking of going to college?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.950
Eun Hye. Eun Hye.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.670
I see, Eun Hye? Right.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.240
That wasn't something that she could have done on her own.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.530
The role of the father is very important.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.680
Hello.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.940
Oh, what brings you here?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.410
I'm sorry, but these shoes... the front is a little tight.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.230
Okay, give them to me.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.750
Isn't it hard for you?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.660
You're here because you are having a hard time, aren't you?

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.620
What's making it so difficult for you?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.340
I get annoyed and angry whenever I think of myself.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.200
Just... I wish I could disappear.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.000
Why?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.050
Because I'm useless in every way.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.530
It's done. Try them on.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.550
They are more comfortable now, right?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.780
Yes. I think they are much better.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.620
I didn't do anything.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.070
I acted like I was hitting them.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.830
- It's the same with before.
- Excuse me?

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.890
If you don't have anywhere to go, you can come here whenever you want.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.680
I feel good just seeing you, too.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.300
Me? What did I do?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.840
There's no reason.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:19.880
If you can make someone happy just by existing, just that is a reason.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.310
I'm very grateful to Hui Joo.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.680
Because she was always by my side when she was still in this world.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.070
Right, Detective Kang really enjoys talking about you.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.000
And there is no specific reason.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.490
It's just because you're by their side.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.500
This is the video that was on your laptop. Is this why

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.710
Gi Dong Jae came to your house?

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.010
Did you go through my laptop without my permission?

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.740
When we arrived, the laptop was already on. We accidentally saw it.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:04.430
Knowing that you have this video, Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo must've sent that person, right?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.130
I...

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.360
Even if the person who assaulted me is revealed, I have no intention of suing or sending that person to jail.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.620
Isn't that my right?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.950
We're not investigating the assault case from two years ago. We're looking for the culprit of the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.460
The content of this video is not important.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.860
But how this video got into your laptop, that's more important.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.140
The person in this video towards the end is Woo Tae Ho.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.280
The strongest possibility is that Woo Tae Ho had this video.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.630
Did he give it to you?

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.070
Or

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.840
Jeong Hui Joo?

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.290
Jeong Hui Joo's murder... Was the fact that this video was given to you, her friend,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.580
the reason she was murdered?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.400
I have a daughter.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.110
She's four.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.780
I have to raise her by myself. It's hard and I'm scared.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.280
"What if something happens to her?"

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:14.430
I have to work hard for my life. Only then will my child grow up having a normal childhood.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.240
So I took the hair salon.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.520
It was the payment for getting beaten.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.720
What did I do so wrong?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.490
This video.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.440
You got it from Ms. Jeong Hui Joo, right?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.170
Just tell us that.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.450
I don't want to talk about Hui Joo.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.240
I'm sorry.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.700
Your friend Jeong Hui Joo died.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.430
We should reveal who killed her.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.760
Ms. Jeong Hui Joo died unfairly.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.710
I'm thankful to Hui Joo.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.930
It hurts my heart, and I feel sorry for her.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.970
You can call me selfish, but

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.670
to me, my child comes first, not Hui Joo.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.750
I'm sorry.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.020
I have nothing else to tell you.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.670
The police

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.850
saw the security footage of you and me from two years ago.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.250
Don't blame me.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.030
They saw it because of the person you sent.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.500
Why do you think I was exposed?

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.590
They weren't looking for me because of Kim Min Ji.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.290
Is that so? Are you sure?

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:35.770
They went to Kim Min Ji while chasing after me. They said so themselves.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:41.940
The Incheon West Station people, I heard they're digging into the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.940
- Then...
- Disappear for a while.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.350
Don't contact anyone.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.860
I'm the only one you need to be in contact with.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.510
No.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.700
I won't contact you, either.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.100
If someone stabs me in the back,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.040
then I'll come to you.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.990
Take care.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.010
The video that you were so preciously hiding

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.680
has fallen into the hands of the police.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.770
The police will soon call me, and you too.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:54.110
I understand that you kept that video to maintain control over me.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.670
But what I don't understand is

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:02.190
why you gave that video to Jeong Hui Joo.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.040
I admit that while I had the video, I got rid of it not too long ago.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.070
How? By asking Jeong Hui Joo?

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:20.910
Then that means Jeong Hui Joo took that video.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.150
How did you learn that Jeong Hui Joo had it?

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.360
That's not what's important now!

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.740
That video is in the hands of the police!

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.500
No problem. There's nothing in it that can count as direct evidence.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.210
That's possible.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:44.130
As long as you don't go and testify that it was all tampered with by you.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.440
When did you learn that Jeong Hui Joo had it?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.690
I told you already! That's not important right now!

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.510
I understand.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.270
I'll take care of it so that the police don't make it an issue.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:27.490

[Incheon West Station]

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.880
This is unexpected. I thought you would be difficult to bring in.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.090
You probably already know,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.960
but we got the video from two years ago.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.940
And we figured out that you are circumstantially related to the case.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.410
Circumstantially? Wouldn't it be better for you to not jump to any conclusions?

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:09.730
The case from two years ago is a separate matter. What we really want to know is

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.390
the culprit of the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.610
This is a person's private life, so the collection of this video was illegal in the first place.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.010
As we thought, you know the law.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.880
However, this came from a murder victim.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.190
It's now legitimate evidence that has nothing to do with personal privacy.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.910
If the victim was killed due to these photos,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.860
wouldn't it be enough evidence?

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.200
Wouldn't any judge approve an arrest warrant

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.860
with this kind of evidence and circumstance?

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:05.390
I'm asking because I think you'll know better than we do since you used to be a prosecutor.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.470
So you're asking for my opinion as a prosecutor.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.510
Find out the source of these photos first. Who took them, and why they took them?

Obtain convincing testimony or evidence.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.930
If the video was secured, check if the victim's statement was consistent enough to identify the culprit

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.490
and if it's reliable enough to be adopted as evidence in a trial.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.530
And...

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.530

And this time, former MIU team leader Choi Yong Geun will be coaching him.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.870
This will take longer than we think.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.450
In addition, Gi Dong Jae is a Gangnam guy, so he's not even in our jurisdiction.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.320
Then let's get support from the Gangnam side.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.910
TJ probably already did the groundwork. It's better not to expect anything from them.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.100
Then should we get the person behind him?

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:59.620
Against TJ? My sister-in-law's husband works for a cleaning company

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.730
that cleans the windows for TJ Group.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.450
Without having to look too far, even the chief's daughter is an employee of TJ Group!

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.710
If things go wrong, three generations will be ruined.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:14.430
We first need to get Gi Dong Jae. Then, if we continue on from there, there won't be any problem.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.530
And how are we supposed to catch Gi Dong Jae?

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.720
There's a saying that detectives say to each other.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.540
"It takes a gangster to catch a gangster." Don't you know?

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.670
Team Leader.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.030
Here you go.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.680
I'm sorry, I'm a bit off today.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.890
- Take care on your way home.
- Okay.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.980
Team Leader.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.730
Are you not feeling well?

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.080
No, I'm okay.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.040
Why? Is something going on?

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.500
I look pathetic to you too, right?

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.780
A guy who has everything he can dream of is just zoning out.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.400
I'm really nothing. Everything is fake.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:52.220
Th-There's nothing... there's nothing r-real.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.090
I'm talking nonsense.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.270
You can go. I'm going to go too.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.710
Where are you going? Did you decide where?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.190
I don't know.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.090
Don't go anywhere now.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.780
Just rest a bit here. I'll be here with you.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.780
It's you, isn't it?

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.240
Who is it?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.020
Who told you to take the photos?

[SEOUL | 16:28 (4:28pm)]

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.700
Ten seconds.
[SEOUL | 16:28 (4:28pm)]

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.150
That's the maximum time I have to forgive you.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.860
[SEOUL | 16:28 (4:28pm)]

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.730
I-I'll tell you.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.390
Who is it?

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.510
What did the detectives say?

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:04.230
Video evidence like that doesn't have enough legal basis to punish you.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.990
The police also know that it's not enough evidence.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.440
Their end goal

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.810
is the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.680
It's a case that has nothing to do with you.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.010
You don't have to concern yourself with it.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.910
Okay, you can go.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.890
Do you

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.680
think that I have something to do

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.790
with that case?

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.770
I'll give you a chance to choose.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.470
If you tell me truthfully now,

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.250
I'll protect you even if it kills me.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.200
If you miss this chance,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.500
I might not be able to protect you.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.800
I had no reason

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.470
to kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.510
That's a relief.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.060
[Jo Sang Pil]

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.010
Jo Sang Pil. He's the guy who started the East Gangnam Gang.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.200
He was murdered in a backroom of a club two years ago.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:45.850
[Goo Jae Choon]

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.580
The one who succeeded is the current boss, Goo Jae Choon.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.750
He's doing well thanks to the Gangnam Redevelopment Project.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.670
And then there are two leaders just under him,
[Lee Seon Goo | Gi Dong Jae]

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.700
one of them being Gi Dong Jae.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.770
When Jo Sang Pil was murdered, we saw Gi Dong Jae as the prime suspect.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:06.040
However, instead, the captain of their rival Rotary Gang

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.920
got arrested on allegations of the murder of Jo Sang Pil.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.820
Eventually, Gi Dong Jae was released,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.930
became an underboss and is in charge of a meat processing company.

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:14.960
Why was Gi Dong Jae a suspect at that time?

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.390
Passion.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:20.170
There was a woman who Jo Sang Pil cared about, and Gi Dong Jae was messing around with her.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.130
Did the captain of the Rotary Gang confess?

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.280
He didn't confess but was instead forced to.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.350
Who made him?

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.660
Choi Yong Geun,

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.940
the former MIU team leader.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.090
Due to allegations of corruption, he's retired and is now the head of TJ's legal team.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.750
Then it was something Gi Dong Jae and Choi Yong Geun planned together.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.890
How's the general atmosphere around Gi Dong Jae's people?

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:41.640
It was no joke.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.660
It was as if they would stab anyone who messed with their boss.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.190
Gi Dong Jae is

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.040
going to be caught by Goo Jae Choon.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.110
You killed Jo Sang Pil, right?

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.270
Detective Oh, who is this person?

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.940
He's the accurate fortune-teller of the Incheon West Station.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.710
- Excuse me?
- You killed Jo Sang Pil to become the boss, right?

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.370
And because you feared getting stabbed by the associates,

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.780
you worked with the police to blame it on someone else. Am I wrong?

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.380
Your eyes say it all.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.570
That case was closed so long ago.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:25.440
And why are West Incheon ajussis causing trouble around the streets of Gangnam?

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.060
Hey, you know me, right?

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.550
Once I target something, I dig until the very end.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.870
The Jo Sang Pil murder case.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.340
I believe that's an unsolved case.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.130
Why would I kill Sang Pil Hyeongnim?

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:45.140
I'm a person with pain in my heart because I couldn't kill the guy who killed Sang Pil.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.460
Hey, stop spewing bullshit,

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.320
and give me your hand.

What are you doing here?

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.550
Do you think I'm some joke?

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.780
You bastards. Come here! Let's talk at the station.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.080
Why are you throwing a fit? I didn't commit any crime!

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.990
Throwing a fit? Come here, you bastard. Come here.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.250
Hyeong, calm down.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.670
It's too early to put on the cuffs.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.290
Detective Oh,

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.030
don't you think you're going too far without any evidence?

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.540
I won't just sit back.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.170
I'm cuffing you so that you stay still, or you'll die if you move.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.450
Hyeong.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.990
Let's just stop here for today.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.880
He's no joke. I'll talk to him so that he understands.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.170
Goo Jae Choon,

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.270
think carefully.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.810
Come to us yourself and confess.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:37.080
Until then, we'll be chasing you for the rest of your life. Beware.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.810
You're the type of person I hate the most.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.840
People who enjoy life after blaming others for their crimes.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.510
I've chosen you, and I will never let you go.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:03.900
Am I cursed or something? There are constantly flies bothering me.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.010
Yes, Goo Jae Choon is here.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.340
He's drinking soju.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.210
Are your hands feeling empty? Should I put these on you?

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.430
I don't think he's thinking of running. I'll let you know if it seems like it. Yeah.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.190
Let's go if you've finished eating.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.780
Hey, the boss is here.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.410
Look here. Look here.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.370
- Is that a video chat?
- Yes.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.650
Yeah, you can see, right? I think he's leaving after having some drinks.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:47.480
Yeah, yeah, in the middle. You can see him.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.440
Hey, you, come forth a bit.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.490
No, to the back, back up.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.240
You went too far. Can't you even line up? Get it together!

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.380
Hey! What are you doing?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.690
There, now it looks like a good picture.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.770
Good. We've checked in on him hanging out in his town, so let's go.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:09.170
Jae Choon, we're leaving! Have a good time.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.850
Why are they doing this?

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:20.780
Is it because I'm doing well these days, and they want some money in their pockets?

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.710
Hyeongnim, Detective Oh Ji Hyeok is part of this.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.250
You know him. He wouldn't do this for money.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.930
Then what is the reason for this?

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.430
Do you really think I killed Sang Pil Hyeongnim?

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.230
From what the detectives said,

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:44.070
I think they said something about me working with another detective to put the blame on someone else.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.830
Do you remember that?

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.860
Yes, I do.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.480
Choi Yong Geun was the detective in charge back then.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.250
Among our group, who was close with Choi Yong Geun?

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.990
He was close with Dong Jae.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.440
Gi Dong Jae?

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.730
It's all fixed, right?

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.350
Yes, you can check it. It'll turn it on.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.460
That's good. You can go.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.030
Okay.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.510
Yes, I got it. Okay.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.260
The detective support team just called.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.870
They said that the burner phone used to call Jeong Hui Joo just turned on.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.030
What?

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.270
Did you check the location?

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:52.820
Yes.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.870
How was this acquired?

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.720
A lady turned it in after picking it up in a park.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.820
Try it.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.050
It's right. The burner phone.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:26.370
This means Cheon Sang Woo was the owner of the phone.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:30.360
The person who gave the phone after picking it up was Cheon Na Na.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.080
Cheon Sang Woo threw it away, and Cheon Na Na picked it up?

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.640
How can this be explained?

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.950
We'll know when I ask.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.010
You worked hard.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.540
I think I might be able to put a price on that deal with this.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.740
This evidence isn't incriminating enough.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.220
To become an assault and battery crime, the assault that happened in the bathroom has to be revealed.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.240
Assault victim Kim Min Ji,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.760
and Team Leader Woo Tae Ho, who tampered with the case, and the assaultee,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.440
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.900
If just one of them opens their mouth, he can be indicted.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:18.560
Then there's no reason for me to put a price on it, since it means there's no possibility of indictment.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.900
If I

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:26.990
have evidence for a murder charge instead of assault, what would you do?

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.640
Which murder case?

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.430
The evidence in the Jeong Hui Joo murder case, of course.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.730
Is that related to my family too?

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.860
Jeong Hui Joo had a secret conversation on a burner phone with someone. And today, that burner phone

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.950
was found.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.150
So?

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.860
The owner of the burner phone has been found as well,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.370
which means a prime suspect in the Jeong Hui Joo case has been found.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.120
Who is it?

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.770
The person who went to the location where the burner phone was thrown away.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.590
It was confirmed by CCTV near the entrance ticket booth. In addition,

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.790
the person who acquired it has also been confirmed.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.350
What is it that you wanted?

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:26.650
Are you trying to hide or reveal the culprit?

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.780
Both.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.500
I can only hide it when the culprit is revealed.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.070
Find the culprit.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.700
If you and I are the only ones who know the true culprit,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.680
then the price of the deal will become very high.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.730
From now on, if the Incheon West Station requests a warrant, allow it.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.690
However, carefully check the reason for issuance in detail and let me know.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.180
Yes, please.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.160
Yes?

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.820
Team Leader.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:29.660
My predecessor Jeong Hui Joo's unpaid wages and severance pay were settled. What should I do with this?

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:35.520
Get it as cash and personally hand it over to her family member. Also,

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.470
this is consolation money the company is giving. Give this along with it.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:48.550
Family member... Who do I have to give this to?

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.730
Shouldn't you be able to look into that on your own?

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.750
I'm sorry.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:57.780
Your predecessor went to the victim's family, who sued us herself.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.340
When you're handing the consolation money, don't treat them clerically; show your sincerity.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.130
They'll only take it then.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.010
You can go.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.390
Okay.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.190
Her brother might get arrested,

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.610
but the sister Cheon Na Na... She purposely gave us evidence

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.280
that's disadvantageous to Cheon Sang Woo?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.870
That doesn't make sense.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.320
She must want to shove Cheon Sang Woo in jail,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.430
or she wants to gain an advantage over her brother using me.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.810
Are they siblings related by blood?

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.810
According to the family registry, yes.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.330
I can't understand them.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:50.400
I've never seen a sibling trying to put their family in jail, even if they hate them.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.280
You just don't understand their world.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.760
Do you?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.330
Isn't it obvious?

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.250
Damn you.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:05.010
Did you, by any chance also show off to Eun Hye that you have a lot of money?

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.700
Eun Hye doesn't judge people by their money. She looks at the actual person.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.140
What do you have more than me except money?

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.870
You talk in a very annoying way, and you're boring too.

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:19.730
I can't understand why she keeps reaching out to you whenever she's in trouble.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.230
Hyeongnim, you're inept at push and pull.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.360
You need to push the right amount and pull strongly.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.530
She doesn't like you because you just keep pulling.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.480
Did Eun Hye tell you that she doesn't like me?

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.670
When you look at Eun Hye, you think of Lee Dae Cheol, right? You feel guilty, right?

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:50.950
You have to get rid of that, then Eun Hye will come to you.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.010
I know, but that's not humanly easy.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.370
Drop him off.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.430
- Hey! What?
- Go!

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.370
Get them! Get them!

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.310
What is this?

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.030
This means Goo Jae Choon is looking for Gi Dong Jae

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.330
and that he found something out.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.530
If not, that guy wouldn't be standing on his feet.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:32.960
All we need to do is to fish that bastard out with a net before Goo Jae Choon captures and kills Gi Dong Jae.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.460
Yes.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.840
Team Leader, I'm here at Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather's store,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.690
but he said he won't take it no matter what.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.630
It's a simple task, why...?

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.110
He keeps asking to meet with you.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.070
He said he has something to talk to you about.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.530
I told him it's not possible,

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.630
but he said he'd come to the company. What should I do?

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.220
Okay.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.000
I think he's having trouble getting here.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.060
Call him and tell him that I'll seek him out myself.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.530
Well, one moment.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.370
I'm sorry, Team Leader.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:37.000
Hello. I heard you have something to say to me.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.230
I saw the pictures with you and Hui Joo.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.380
Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong, can you wait outside for a bit?

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.180
Was it you? The one who killed Hui Joo?

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.200
No, it wasn't me.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.000
Then who was it?

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.850
If it wasn't you, tell me who it is.

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.630
I don't know, either.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:16.080
Even if you didn't kill Hui Joo yourself, Hui Joo died because of you.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.820
Did she like you?

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.280
No.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.020
I...

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.100
liked her.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.500
You're a married man. So, why?

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.170
I'm sorry.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.850
When she died,

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.550
were you

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.440
sad?

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.300
Why did you do it?

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.370
Why did you like her?

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.000
The police will capture the culprit.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:17.250
I'll be as cooperative as I can with the investigation, too.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.210
I'm sorry.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.410
Team Leader.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.480
I have an urgent matter to tend to, so I'm going leaving first.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.290
I'm sorry.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.670
I'm sorry.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.570
I'm so sorry.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.750
I'm sorry.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.970
Good job, Jeong Hui Joo. I'm sorry to hold you so late.

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:39.150
It's work. It's okay.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.830
Yes, Vice Chairman.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.350
Yes, I understand.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.500
I'll send someone to bring cash that way.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.310
Send me the club name and the address by text.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.230
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.980
- Can you give us a bottle of soju here?
- Okay.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.240
Thank you.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.700
Here.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.860
Drink up a shot.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.480
One more shot.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:59.350
That's enough. I'll drink the rest at home. That's okay, right?

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.860
Do you want me to make you a cup of coffee?

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:46.530
Na Na,

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.040
I'll

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:52.200
put handcuffs on Cheon Sang Woo's hands.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.850
I met with a detective today.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:05.670
He suspected my brother of being the culprit in Jeong Hui Joo's murder case.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.440
But that's too big of a crime.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.730
I don't think I'll be able to handle that much.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:16.040
Wouldn't it be enough just to be a perpetrator in an assault case?

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.180
No.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.440
Cheon Sang Woo.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.600
If we don't totally bring him down now, it's dangerous for us.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.520
Do you also think my brother killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.410
Do as you wish.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.340
I'll trust and follow you.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.090
Hyeongnim.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.370
Oh, you're here.

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.900
How are you these days?

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.370
I'm resting a bit.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.140
Doesn't quite fit you, does it?

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.560
No. Resting is hard.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.380
How's it between you and your wife?

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.450
Are you still living separately?

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.070
We're doing our best separately.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.750
Why do you live in such a complicated way?

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:41.970
If both of you stepped back a little and lived together, it would be fine, too.

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:45.490
I want to, but the situation isn't that great.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.440
You're old-fashioned too.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.240
You live only looking forward.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.470
You should look around, and pick up things for yourself.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:59.420
Do you think anyone will reward you for living the way you do?

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.680
I don't think so.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:09.370
I helped some guys during the construction of one TJ's affiliates,

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:12.300
and I got this place.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.840
Wow, you live in a different world than me.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.310
You live here.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:23.320
It's a house I took under the table, so it's a bit difficult to sell it openly.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.440
I have no other intentions, so don't misunderstand me.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.390
Well, I'll think about it.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.470
Gi Jin.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.860
Yes?

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:40.100
Do you know what I have learned since I joined TJ?

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.070
That everyone's a thief.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.920
The difference with the small thieves that we've been catching

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.310
is that what they steal has no owner.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.390
MIU will be contacting you soon.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.750
Excuse me?

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.510
- Let's be in touch.
- Hyeongnim!

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:05.120
Don't overcomplicate things. All you have to do is catch bad guys and put them in jail.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.310
Yes, Chief.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.670
Okay.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.890
I'll return right away.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.290
Twenty-two.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.120
Next.

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:46.160
Thirty-two.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.610
Next.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.650
Has it been correct until now?

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.180
Hurry.

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:57.950
Wait. Okay, keep going.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:00.090
Forty-six!

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.450
Is it really? R-R-Really!? Is it correct?

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.830
I feel crappy, damn it.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.180
Even so, it's third place! It's more than 1,000,000 won (~$1,000) at this point. This is a hit!

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.990
I know, I know!

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.420
But,

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.460
I just feel like I used all my luck on this.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.440
My life is

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.600
worth only 1,000,000 won.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.160
Don't overreact.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.830
It's just a single number that was off on a lottery ticket.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:43.360
You think this is just a single number?

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:59.470
It's no wonder I felt some rumbling signals in my large intestine.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.510
What?

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.020
Okay.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.940
Follow them without them noticing you.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.250
If they seem suspicious, call us right away.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.280
Goo Jae Choon's gang is on the move.

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.220
Seeing that Goo Jae Choon is moving, they must've found Gi Dong Jae.

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.810
I'm curious.

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:58.620
Which higher-up person's name will come out of his mouth when we catch him?

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.710
He won't speak it so easily.

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:04.300
If he won't talk, we'll tell him we'll release him.

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:07.090
If we release him,

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.920
Goo Jae Choon will kill Gi Dong Jae.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.790
Jail is safer for him right now.

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:14.110
[To live with self-reflection will reform the future]

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:24.140
[To live with self-reflection will reform the future]

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.440
Why did you suddenly call me?

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.030
McQueen's leadership chose Woo Tae Ho

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.790
as the next CEO of TJ.

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.890
Woo Tae Ho?

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.500
Are you serious? With what qualifications would he─

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.790
Just because McQueen chose Woo Tae Ho

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:44.300
doesn't mean TJ will go to Woo Tae Ho.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.200
However,

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.250
you need to admit that Tae Ho is a step ahead of you.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:56.120
Na Na is behind him. She's putting him in front and thinking to take the power for herself.

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.150
Na Na is my family too.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.050
She deserves it, too.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.310
However,

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:05.190
I don't want her.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:06.910
She knows that, too.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.720
That's why

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.200
I can never forgive her.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.370
I called again,

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:20.040
but the grandpa said he would never take the money, even if it killed him.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.850
So I just sent the rest of the pay to his account.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.730
Okay, take care of it that way.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.510
Do you still have something to say?

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:38.890
I've

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:41.190
been thinking about this a lot.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:44.570
I think I need to tell you this.

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.940
I saw you accidentally.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:54.270
I saw you crying because of Ms. Jeong Hui Joo.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.750
You liked Ms. Jeong Hui Joo, right?

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:01.730
That's why

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.600
you were so desperately sad,

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.000
and said you were sorry to her. Right?

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:13.130
Don't worry too much about what I said.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.940
I just wanted to know your true feelings.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.090
That way, I thought my suspicions would disappear.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.630
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.340
Yes?

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.740
They decided to push Woo Tae Ho as the next CEO at the McQueen general assembly.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.090
Are you satisfied?

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.660
Good work.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.770
I'll fill you in with the details once I get back.

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.030
See you.

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:06.400
Okay. I'll repay you.

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.350
Call the reporters, please.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:36.420
Don't you think that bastard is just looping around?

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.590
Yes.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.010
We're getting further away from the place Detective Byeon told us about.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:46.340
That bastard. They're purposely going around with us on their tail.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.880
Turn the car.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.450
Okay.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:12.320
I know what a difficult situation TJ Group is in.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.540
I first want to say that I'm very sorry

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.560
to make such an announcement out of a lack of choice

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.750
in such an emergent situation.

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:26.300
I am planning to put an end to my eight-year marriage,

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.190
and divorce my husband.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.440
I ask you,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.250
please don't relate my personal life to TJ's current situation.

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.030
What's the reason for your divorce?

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.250
Is it related to the successor issue?

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:51.170
Did your husband agree to the divorce?

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:31.520
Na Na, why?

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.180
Why?

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.150
Yes, Hyeongnim.

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.100
They went into the building just now.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.590
How many are there?

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:14.630
About twenty, I think.

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.160
First, check if Gi Dong Jae is there.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.800
And don't make a move until we're there. Wait for us no matter what.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.390
Okay.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.730
What did he say?

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.030
He said to "wait no matter what."

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.750
It looks like they didn't find him, right?

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:38.260
Those bastards made a wrong assumption.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.570
They should've made a move when they were certain. Those bastards are making us tired too.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:45.880
Hey, he's in the back! Get out!

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.700
You guys follow me, and you guys go to the back.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.900
Hyeong!

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.140
I think they found Gi Dong Jae.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.050
What do we do?

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:58.040
What do you mean, what do we do? Let's get him quickly.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.470
Hyeongnim said to wait.

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:02.700
He will be angrier if we lose him, so get him first!

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.090
- Park it there.
- Okay.

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.850
What is this? They're not here.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.330
Above, above, above.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.810
Hey! Get him!

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.930
Stop him!

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:09.010
Gi Dong Jae!

01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:11.110
You bastards.

01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:43.920
You bastards!

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.720
Man Goo. Man Goo!

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.700
Hey, Man Goo, are you okay?

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.540
Get that bastard.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.730
You're not okay!

01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:00.150
I'm okay, so go get him!

01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:02.970
Hey, get it together, you idiot!

01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:06.740
Hey!

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.190
Hyeongnim!

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:14.110
Come here!

01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:17.690
Stop there!

01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:19.190
Call... call 911!

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:21.900
Get the first aid kit, hurry!

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.410
You go up! Up!

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.430
Hey,

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.660
Man Goo, it's okay. This is nothing.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.840
You didn't get stabbed.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.260
Open your eyes! You're okay.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.290
I told you to wait, you bastards!

01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:38.030
You're okay.

01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:41.620
Man Goo, Man Goo. Open your eyes.

01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.430
Hey! Let's get them!

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:58.630
Come here, you bastard.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.870
Stop, you bastard!

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.180
Byeon Hyeongnim!

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.510
He went that way. That way.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.390
Are you okay?

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.670
Hyeongnim.

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:32.600
Jae Hong, one moment. Don't leave yet.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.210
Okay.

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.630
Ji Woong, are you okay?

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.240
Is Man Goo okay?

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.970
Yes, don't worry about him, he's all right.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:49.550
Man Goo has really good health, you know?

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:51.280
Just worry about yourself.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.880
He said let's wait.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.210
Man Goo said let's wait, but I...

01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.720
I know.

They brought Jeong Hui Joo to the mountain and dumped her

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.040
and disappeared with the car.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.820
I think there is a crucial piece of evidence.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:00.230
I'm more worried about the people on our side than the police.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:02.960
Didn't it ever occur to you that I could leave you?

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.760
Tell me where it hurts for him.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.140
Just kill that bastard.

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.960
Did you find something out about me?

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.580
I was hoping you would continue to be in charge of that case.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.790
He found evidence that says Cheon Sang Woo is the culprit?

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.580
- What if that's not it?
- Confess?

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:20.520
You don't know anything about this case, okay?
