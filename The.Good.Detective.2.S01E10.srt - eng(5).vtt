00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.670
Hey!

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.030
What is it now?
[Episode 10]

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.430
You bastard.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.230
Are you messing with my guys?

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.270
Do you think my guys are idiots who can be messed with, you freaking bastard?

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.010
Why are you releasing Gi Dong Jae? That bastard killed a person. So why?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.260
- Do you really want to get fucked?
- You bastard, you—

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.850
Are you crazy? How dare you wave your fist around here?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.610
- Let go!
- Hyeongnim!

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.770
You bastards!

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.430
- Don't let them go and keep fucking them up! Keep going!
- Stop.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.120
Let go! Let go!

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.580
- Let go of me.
- Stay still.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.190
- Hyeong!
- I said let go!

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.370
- Stay still.
- I said, let go, you bastard!

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.740
I'm telling you to stay still!

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.160
What are you doing? Arrest them for being caught red-handed!

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040
Go ahead, do it, you bastard!

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.290
Hyeongnim, we're all cops! Arresting them is a bit...

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.100
Then throw them in the damn holding cell!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.260
How did all of the morons get put together?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.710
Hey! If you're going to live like that,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.750
you should've become a thug, not a cop!

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.570
If you let Gi Dong Jae go this time, Gi Dong Jae's victims, and their families...

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.140
You're killing them twice! Once by Gi Dong Jae, and the second time

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.200
by a police thug. You killed them!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.470
Do you realize that?

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.660
You killed too, you know.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.990
You made Lee Dae Cheol into a murderer and got him executed,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.100
and you made Kim Hyeong Bok a murderer and made him die an awful death.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.580
If you'd investigated properly, those people wouldn't have died like that.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.370
And by making a fuss trying to catch the real culprit, a chaebol's son-in-law with a good life died because of you.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.040
There was a victim

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.100
but you've created another victim in the process with your crazy actions.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.240
You've made another family suffer because of that.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.170
You, a cop, did that.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.270

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.250
I told you clearly, never come here again.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.170
You, Ms. Jeong Hui Joo,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.260
and Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo—the secret only the three of you know.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.990
We found that out.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.590
Because Mr. Woo Tae Ho recorded the conversation he had with you.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.020
I know what kind of promise Mr. Woo Tae Ho made.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.810
That promise,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.070
we, the police, will uphold in his place.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.710
We have a policeman who was dispatched to America as well.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.060
Your daughter Soo Yeon, we can surely find her and bring her back.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.800
So?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.210
What do you want from me?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.320
You need to testify at the trial and say exactly what you said to Mr. Woo Tae Ho.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.340
No.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.480
You guys can't bring Soo Yeon.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.660
You don't know what Cheon Sang Woo is capable of.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.230
Then why did you tell Mr. Woo Tae Ho?

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.950
That person

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.420
had the ability to bring Soo Yeon.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.040
What happened to Ms. Jeong Hui Joo happened because she was trying to get your child back for you.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.380
Don't you feel any guilt? I mean, why are you only thinking about yourself?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.180
Guilt?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.000
I feel it.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.360
But aren't you also thinking only about yourself?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.460
You think all you need to do is catch the culprit.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.870
You don't care what happens to anyone else as long as you catch the culprit.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.480
I was thinking of going to America.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.780
Even if I didn't get to meet her in person, I wanted to see her from afar.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.370
But,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.300
that's not going to happen anymore.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.940
Because he

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.180
will hide Soo Yeon from me.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.610
Noona.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.060
I have something to ask you.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.170
Yeah, what is it? Are the questions too difficult?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.280
No, it's not that.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.380
The exam I got 100% on...

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.440
Do you think I could show it to my dad?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.490
Show it. He'd like that too.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.160
No. I think Mom will get angry.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.910
Come on, why would your mom get angry?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.460
No. Mom doesn't like me meeting with Dad because

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.820
I'm all she has.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.720
You know, Mom says it every day,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.100
"I live for you. Live for you."

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.690
That's possible. Your mom only has you for real.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.730
Then do I need to live because of Mom?

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.720
I can never make her angry, and I always have to get perfect scores?

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.280
I want to play games and hang out with my friends,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.560
and I want to hang out with Dad too.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.970
That's─

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.520
Welcome back.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.580
Oh, yeah.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.130
Aigoo, Jae Woong!

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.020
You're studying again?

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.120
How do you always choose to do the cutest things?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.530
I live because of you, because of you.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.740
Why?

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.320
Do you not like me kissing you?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.790
You can't do that. Because of you I─

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.160
Ahjussi, I have something to ask you.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.880
If you're tired, we can talk tomorrow.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.870
It's okay. Ask me.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.630
Grandpa wasn't at the store again today.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.860
I don't think he's eating well, either.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.120
I think he's deeply hurt.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.840
Why did he have to go to that jerk Cheon Sang Woo and get into a situation like that?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.600
Did you find the culprit who killed Hui Joo?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.190
I think that the culprit needs to be caught for Grandpa to be able to rest easy.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.840
Well, it's

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.720
not that easy.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.140
He believes in you.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.710
I also believe that you will be able to catch the culprit.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.850
Eun Hye,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.590
I'm not that great a detective.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.320
You solved my dad's case.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.460
Thanks to you, Dad was able to pass away a little more peacefully.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.700
So this time, Grandpa could also─

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.410
Eun Hye,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.640
I couldn't save your father.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.270
What's the point of passing away peacefully?

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.920
If I had started the investigation properly─

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.350
If you were going to think like this, you should have just let my father die as a murderer.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.760
Why did you let him die unfairly?

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.010
Why do you make my heart ache every time I think of Dad? Why?

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.930
I don't resent you.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.300
I just don't like that you keep trying to become a better person all the time by blaming yourself.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.130
Tell me honestly.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.230
Did Woo Tae Ho really kill himself?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.640
Why did you have to announce the divorce and make him go to such a place?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.230
It's a story people made up. It was a simple accident.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.770
Right.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.090
He's not the type of guy who would crash on purpose when you were in the car.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.690
He's also such a calm person with everything,

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.740
so he couldn't have caused the accident.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.460
Anyway, I'm very thankful for him.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.960
He took all of our burdens with him.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.070
And you don't have to concern yourself about the divorce either.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.510
You're speaking rudely.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.900
- What?
- Your sister became a widow.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.160
What kind of consoling is that?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.080
You never accepted Tae Ho as your husband, either.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.930
I thought being a dad would change a person.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.850
You're the same.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.770
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.330
He was the only person who protected the vice chairman.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.660
Which means,

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.610
there's no one to protect the vice chairman now.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.630
Na Na, I think you're misunderstanding something here─

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.780
Thank you for the food.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.820
I'm going to head out. I've lost my appetite.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.150
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.610
You're going at it as if it would kill you not to catch the culprit.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.680
You think all you need to do is catch the culprit.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.430
You don't care what happens to anyone else,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.800
as long as you catch the culprit.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.430
What brings you here?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.290
Just because...

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.340
Do you think you're a good person?

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.610
Snap out of it.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.280
You can't become a good person.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.180
That's how it is for detectives.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.770
I think Na Na is trying to find dirt on me.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.850
As in?

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.180
I thought being a dad would change a person.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.160
You're the same.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.670
Something that she could never know,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.870
she has found out.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.160
I'm sorry, Team Leader.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.500
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho said to only give it to Director Cheon Na Na, so...

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.500
Is it serious? Something that shouldn't get to the police?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.310
No, it's not that serious,

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.220
but it concerns me anyway.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.020
I understand. I'll try to control it somehow.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.020
Control?

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.340
I mean, are you saying

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.070
you can control Na Na?

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.300
No. How dare I?

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.810
I'm just saying that to keep you from harm,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.610
I'll take care of things both on the inside and outside.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.560
Did you check the USB Team Leader Woo Tae Ho left?

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.060
Yes.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.910
What were the contents?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.810
It's mostly secrets related to my family.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.110
There were a few things I didn't know either, so I think it'll be helpful to me.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.820
I see.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.490
Was there anything else besides that?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.650
There's nothing you have to be concerned about. You don't need to worry.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.010
Okay, I understand.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.740
And I have one thing to ask you.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.120
Why does it seem like Woo Tae Ho killed himself?

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.980
I'm not sure, but it's not something that would cause you or me harm, is it?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.870
And there was a need to cover up the Jeong Hui Joo case either.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:02.340
I don't think it's something you should decide without my input.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.730
Do you think I'm scared of you?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.330
I'm sorry. It was related to the police side of things,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
so I thought I could take care of it on my own.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.310
I apologize if it upset you.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.100
The plan was just delayed a bit because he was in an accident.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.510
As we agreed, you'll get what you wanted.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.010
Okay, I understand.

[Legal Team - Team Leader: Choi Yong Geun]

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.580
[Will the owner of TJ change? The next CEO will be decided at the regular shareholders meeting]

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.070
When we opened the chicken restaurant, over half of it was a loan.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.430
We didn't have any savings. So we opened

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.320
a chicken restaurant with the loan we had,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.170
but the business started booming!

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.600
There's a crowd of customers coming in and constant delivery calls coming in.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.030
I mean, the culprit was running away right in front of my eyes,

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.940
and suddenly, I got a call for an order.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.290
"Never did chicken taste this good."

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.450
"Hello, this is Wang Galbee Chicken."
(T/N: From the movie 'Extreme Job')

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.960
It just came out of me spontaneously because I was selling chicken.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.020
It became a habit!

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.860
Even while the culprit was running in front of me!

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.490
A detective shouldn't just start selling chicken in the middle of capturing a culprit!

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.430
Hello, Grandpa.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.880
Oh, hey. Sit here.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.910
You should listen to his story.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.170
It's a true story Detective Kang experienced while working undercover,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.070
and it's so amusing!

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.970
Really? It's something that actually happened to him, huh?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.280
Yes, yes. So did you catch the culprit or not?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.720
Well, I ran like crazy and caught up to him.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.040
But then suddenly, I said,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.400
"Do you get up each morning too" and the culprit goes
(T/N: From the movie 'Memories of Murder')

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.470
"You've done your job."
(T/N: From the movie 'Friend')

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.580
"You've done your job!"

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.430
You've done...

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.200
You don't think it's funny?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.600
I-I mean.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.420
He's enjoying it.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.700
Laugh for real.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.610
"You've done your job..."

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.570
If you plagiarize something, you should do it once.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.540
If you get all these stories and mash them together, it doesn't make sense.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.080
I've never finished any movies,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.590
so with one story, it's not enough.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.830
Why are you out?

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.910
Go back in. You'll catch a cold.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.860
Go, go.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.070
Let's go.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.490
I think he'll go in only when he can't see us.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.120
Okay.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.470
I told you already. Stop working too hard to become a good person.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.520
What are you talking about? I'm a bad detective.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.030
I'm a bad guy who's gone as far as receiving dress shoes as a bribe from a victim's family.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.590
Mine are much more expensive than the ones you got.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.160
They're bigger, but it doesn't mean they're more expensive.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.010
Should we ask which ones are more expensive?

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.310
This is real leather.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.150
Mine are good too.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.070
Yours look like fabric.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.660
No, they're not.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.840
They're really comfortable.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.170
Are you following me?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.740
Do you know whose house this is? Are you following me knowing that?

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.910
This is a police chief's house, you idiot! The house of the highest person at a police station!

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.980
You messed with the wrong person.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.910
You stupid idiot.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.600
It doesn't seem like the Incheon West Station guys are going to give up easily.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.000
Honestly, they're nothing one-on-one, but they're coming at me as a group like their lives depend on it.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.750
Let's break them down one by one.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.360
I'm going to get their higher-up involved.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.700
- Higher-up?
- Yes.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.960
Luckily, the daughter of the chief over there is an employee on my team.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.960
If his daughter's problem becomes a part of it, don't you think the chief will turn to our side?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.780
Don't you think it'll be a bit too dangerous to go as far as the detectives' families?

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.200
They're sensitive about their families.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.410
Don't worry about it. I've already set up a safety net.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.840
We checked all the accounts that are under Choi Yong Geun's name,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.200
and we checked all the recent phone records,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.220
but there's no trace of Gi Dong Jae left.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.700
We checked all the CCTVs near his house, places he often goes to like restaurants and saunas,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.020
but he was never caught on tape with Gi Dong Jae.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.780
That's expected. He worked as a detective for over twenty years.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.780
He probably got rid of the footage already.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.350
Oh, there's one thing we were able to confirm.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.940
Choi Yong Geun has an apartment under his name in addition to the one he lives in right now,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.770
and we confirmed that Jang Gi Jin has recently been living there.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.830
The two were on the same team.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.700
The serial killer photos that Choi Yong Geun sent to Gi Dong Jae

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.850
were sent from Jang Gi Jin to Choi Yong Geun.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.410
And Choi Yong Geun gave the apartment to Jang Gi Jin for taking care of the case behind the scenes.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.310
I can see why Jang Gi Jin was trying to get Gi Dong Jae out.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.480
Choi Yong Geun told him to.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.150
Maybe we'd learn something if we made Choi Yong Geun and Gi Dong Jae question each other.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.700
Don't we need something more substantial to make those two question each other?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.730
Would they even look our way with just a few photos that were sent around?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.440
We have to find something before Jang Gi Jin, that bastard, releases Gi Dong Jae.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.120
Gi Dong Jae, Choi Yong Geun. If one of those two disappears, we'd be right back where we started from.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.080
Like the team leader said, I don't think it's a good idea to expect to get something from Choi Yong Geun,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.260
but maybe Gi Dong Jae has something.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.040
Right, I think Gi Dong Jae is holding onto something

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.060
in case he gets blamed for everything.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.140
Gi Dong Jae, that bastard, we've checked everything in his hiding place.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.190
But, except for the deleted crime scene photo from his PC, there wasn't anything.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:16.100
Hey, I'm not sure if this would help, but on the day I got my head smashed in by Gi Dong Jae...

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.350
And? Did you see what he was handing over?

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.890
Well,

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.980
I don't think it was tiny. Like...

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.610
I'm not sure.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.900
Wasn't it a cellphone?

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.170
I-I-I think it was, yes.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.840
Gi Dong Jae knew he was being chased by the police.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.340
He handed it over to one of his guys in case he were to get caught.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.240
There's going to be something in that cellphone.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.160
Something he kept in case he's the only one blamed for the murder.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.160
- Did you see who he handed it over to?
- I'll know the moment I see him.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.100
Let's catch him. If we catch him and mess him up. The phone will turn up.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.700
Hyeongnim, let us take care of this.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.420
Hyeong, we need to do it. We have to find that phone and put Gi Dong Jae back in jail.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.650
We'll do it.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.350
We will find and bring the phone, no matter what.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.400
Byeon Ji Woong and Ji Man Goo will do it.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.250
No one else gets involved in the investigation, do you understand me?

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.210
Yes.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.870
Hyeong, we made this situation, we should fix it.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.150
Of course. Because we're the universe's strongest partners.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:37.950
You keep saying that, but isn't the universe's strongest... Superman and Batman?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.260
Oh, right.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.060
They don't work together.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.220
You two are the only ones, the universe's strongest partners.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.950
It's Batman and Robin.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.820
- Hey!
- What is this?

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.840
Hey, Man Goo.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.030
Long time no see.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.370
I'm going to ask something.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.670
Hey, on the day Gi Dong Jae gave us these,

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.900
there was something you got from him, right? Where is it?

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.330
What are you talking about?

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.220
You bastard.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.690
Look at this, I said. Look at my head.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.870
You know why we have these, right?

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.870
I'm going to ask one more time.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:49.070
The day Gi Dong Jae did this to us, where is the thing that he handed to you?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:56.160
You see, we went to the hospital and were prescribed the maximum amount of painkillers.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.380
And thanks to the medicine, we're going a bit insane!

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.780
I'm going to ask one more time while my mind is still intact.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.490
The thing that Gi Dong Jae gave you, that guy who's made us super angry.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.510
Where is it right now?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.020
Where is it, you bastard!

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.480
Where is it?

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.490
Yes, she just went into a café.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.400
Should I go in?

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.950
Yes, Team Leader?

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:54.140
I was at Lawyer Choi's office, and I went inside a café for a moment to grab a coffee.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.120
I'll be back at the office soon, but what can I do for you?

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.500
I forgot some documents.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.990
I'll send them to you by email now, so print them out and show them to Lawyer Choi.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.970
This is something that shouldn't be kept as an email or a file, even on Lawyer Choi's side, okay?

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.510
I'll send them now.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.720
Yes, I got the email.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.270
It's something so important that if it gets to the opposing company,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.050
it can cost us the trial.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:33.050
You could get hacked, so print the document first and then delete it right away.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.590
Do you understand?

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.130
It's a trial with billions of won riding on it. Keep that in mind.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.950
I understand.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.520
Okay.

[Legal Team - Team Leader: Choi Yong Geun]

I sent the related documents to the audit department, and they called him in. They're talking right now.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.520
Okay, we just need to mess them up one by one.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.590
My laptop.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.720
Calling suite 102102.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.160
There is no answer.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.350
- Yeah?
- Did you make any progress?

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.750
Of course, we messed up Gi Dong Jae's guy and were able to find it.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.780
He said he received it that day and gave it to Gi Dong Jae's girlfriend.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.620
Did you meet her yet?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.920
We're in front of Gi Dong Jae's girlfriend's house, but she's not here.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.940
We just need to wait here until she comes back.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.890
Call any time if you need backup.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.710
I'll be on stand by with Dong Wook at the station.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.190
Make sure you eat all of your meals.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.080
Okay, good luck.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.470
Ms. Bo Kyeong.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:05.830
Hey.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.080
Detective Oh is currently at the head agency.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.180
- Oh, really?
- Should I call him?

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.940
- Yes, yes.
- Hey, leave it. He must be talking about something important.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.430
That selfish guy wouldn't answer his phone. He'd ignore it.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.660
Wealthy people are usually like that.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.840
If they need you, they string you along and act like they'd sell their home for you,

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.390
and once they have what they need, you're instantly thrown out. Just deleted.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.380
Then what should I do? It's really urgent.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.830
What? Is something going on?

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.930
I need to find my laptop.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.260
If I don't, it's my life that'll be deleted. My life will be deleted!

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.910
What do I do? We need to catch him and quickly find my laptop.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.350
I have to find it today. If not, I'm dead.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.630
Listen carefully.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.750
You go over there near the window and have a cup of coffee.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.010
By the time the sun is just starting to set, you'll get a call from me.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.500
I'll report that I caught him and found your laptop.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.100
Really?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.980
Let's get moving.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.480
Hyeong, leave this bastard to me.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.740
I'll get him right away.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.540
I looked into it and found out that the woman is a daughter of a chief.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.470
Why didn't you tell me sooner? This is seriously dangerous.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.400
And? What do you want?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.540
I'm not saying I won't do it at this point.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.700
I'm just saying there should be more pay for the risk.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.740
Okay, I'll send in the money right away, so send that laptop quickly first.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.610
No, wait.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.830
Just toss it somewhere so no one finds it.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.890
Let's talk after I get the money.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.030
If you drag this out,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.720
you're going to be caught right away.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.020
She's a daughter of a chief, like you said. If you drag in the cops─

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.620
This stupid bastard, seriously.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.040

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.330
Oh, hey, Dong Wook.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.370
Where are you right now?

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.820
Well, this is...

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.070
Whatever.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.920
I'll send you an address, so run over, right now.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.440
Dong Wook, I have some important business right now.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.930
What important business would a guy who quit his job and drinks all day have?

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.440
Come quickly.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.410
Before I find you and break your wrist.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.200
Hey, hey!

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.790
Dong Wook, don't get too excited.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:02.980
Calm down and let's hear your brother out first.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.710
Welcome.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.230
Hey, Dong Wook, Dong Wook.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.090
You! When are you going to grow up?

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.040
It's about time you get it together.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.990
For how much longer do I have to carry you on my back?

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.320
Why should I? For a person who doesn't even act like one?

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.410
- I'm sorry. Dong Wook.
- Let go!

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.140
Why are you acting like this?

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.170
This is a case!

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:40.220
We need to work on the case first, and then you two can personally deal with your sibling problems later.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.900
Okay?

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.760
What about the laptop that you stole?

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.080
Did you already hand it over?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.580
N-No not yet.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.520
This is your laptop, right?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.450
Yes, it is.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.290
What about that important document?

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.640
I put a password on it, and it doesn't look like he opened it.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.830
The document is there correctly.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.440
And there's no trace that he sent it through email.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.240
That's a relief.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.870
I'm arresting you for theft, caught red-handed.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.620
Don't even dream about the right to hire a lawyer.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.680
And the right to remain silent, so it can't be used against you in court? Forget about that shit.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.350
Do you understand me? You damn thief.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.390
Dong Wook, I'm sorry.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.120
I'm really sorry.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.420
Sorry.

If Lee Eun Hye is revealed to be an accomplice, I'll be responsible and bring her back.

This is your own recording, right?

- Yes.
- Why would you go so far to protect Ms. Lee Eun Hye?

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.870
Isn't this a closed case already?

"As long as you know a detective, you'll be able to get released like this."

[1. Facts of suspected crime | I, according to the facts of suspected crime...]

The victim doesn't want to press charges.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.050
We'll let you go with a warning. So, that guy,

the person who told you to steal the laptop,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.570
just tell us who he is.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.820
Get going.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.950
Don't drink on the way back, and just rest at home.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.920
I'm sorry.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.900
I'm really sorry.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.100
I don't deserve to see Dong Wook.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.170
Just like he said, I'm not even human.

Hey, if you need money, don't contact Dong Wook,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.000
and contact me.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.630
If it's money that you really need, I'll get it for you somehow.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.630
Take it.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.560
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.710
I feel like Dong Wook

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.510
met a real older brother

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.310
in you instead of me.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.530
Thank you so much.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.850
It's Choi Yong Geun.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.850
That bastard found your brother and lured him in.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:33.000
Hyeong, maybe I should quit being a policeman.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.670
What would you do if you quit?

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.700
I'm too ashamed to be a detective now.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.230
Why? Because of your brother?

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.110
That guy will never change.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.010
He's going to live his whole life causing trouble like that.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.060
And I can't just get rid of him. He's my older brother.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.580
No matter how hard I think, I can't find a solution.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.350
When I was at the interview for the joining the police,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.100
this guy asked a question like this.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.100
"Would you arrest the culprit even if it was your family member?"

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.490
So I said, "I don't know." And he said that's the right answer.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.330
Sometimes the answer is to not know.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.290
I'm going in.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.360
[Police]

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.550
As you said, I relayed all the content to Lawyer Choi.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.060
I deleted all the emails you sent as well.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.900
Good job.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.900
But there was a small incident in the middle.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.890
Incident?

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.110
Someone stole my laptop.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.620
Luckily, I found it quite quickly, but anyway, don't worry too much about it.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.990
The email you sent was not leaked at all.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.970
That's a relief.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.330
My imagination might be overreacting a bit,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.750
but I think there's a bad person behind the man who stole the laptop.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:02.460
Some rat bastard who's trying to bring TJ down from behind the scenes.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.750
You should be careful, too. They hit below the belt.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.070
I'm going to go now.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.760
Okay.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:32.600
Gi Dong Jae will be released today.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.460
Good job.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.980
By the way, Gi Jin,

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:42.050
things keep getting complicated.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.680
This time, let's be very careful so that things don't go wrong.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.540
Should I be grateful?

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.290
Get lost.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.370
I clearly told Mr. Choi not to have me released.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.990
You think you're a really great person, don't you?

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.480
Get off your high horse, you bastard.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.750
You're like a worm in the ground.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.810
You're not even worth stepping on.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.480
We're letting you go because we might get blood on our shoes.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.900
Just quietly

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.900
go back into the dirt, keep your head down,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.690
and die.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.850
Dong Jae.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.950
Why did you kill the big boss?

00:37:54.950 --> 00:38:00.410
Hey you, wasn't it Sang Pil Hyeongnim who rescued you from rolling around on the ground?

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.980
And then you killed your savior because of some girl?

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.990
You're an animal, not a human!

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.950
Hyeongnim, I didn't kill him.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:14.250
I really didn't kill him!

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.200
Choi Yong Geun told us everything.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.210
He even explained it all in detail.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.370
It's the truth, no matter how you look at it.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.930
Throw this bastard away.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.030
And make sure to be careful so that the trash doesn't float up.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.480
- Yes, sir.
- Hyeongnim!

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.890
Hyeongnim, hear me out for a moment!

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.080
What is this?

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.200
Who left this here?

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.230
Oh, wow.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.200
It's from Ms. Bo Kyeong.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.750
She left it as a thank you to me for taking care of her problem.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.250
Remember she said she needed to stop by the station?

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.120
She wasn't here to see the chief, she stopped by to give me this!

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.160
- There's no note or anything, though.
- That's exactly Ms. Bo Kyeong's style.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.960
Being subtle about her feelings.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.640
It's embarrassing to show your heart so openly.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.930
She left it secretly. Do you understand now?

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.850
Ms. Bo Kyeong's real feelings hiding in her heart?

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.850
Let's eat it together when the other team members come back.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:27.540
Hey! Ms. Bo Kyeong gave it to me to eat!

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.950
Dad, when I was young,

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.640
I couldn't understand why you were never home and chasing culprits like your life depended on it.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.780
Same with your colleagues.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.360
But now I know.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.860
What do you know?

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.390
It's because it angers you.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:48.980
It lights a fire in the heart, and if you don't catch the culprit, it feels like you're going to explode from anger.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.100
You... What happened to you?

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.080
Yeah, I think there's going to be some work today.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.530
The chief made an emergency call just now.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.660
Aigoo. What can I do even if you're upset? It's work.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.970
Tell our daughter that I'm sorry that I can't be at our princess' birthday

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.830
and that I bought a cake but left it at the office.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.220
So you should take... You're eating it? Why?

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.610
Happy birthday!

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.890
Where is everybody?

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:15.970
I'll call back later.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.930
Yes. Byeong Ji Woong and Ji Man Goo are undercover,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.950
and I contacted the rest, so they'll be here soon.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:25.280
Tell them to hurry up and get back here! TJ or whatever, I don't care!

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.160
How dare they light a fire in my daughter's heart?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.790
I'm going to mess them up, those bastards!

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.290
I heard your wife came home. Does she like it?

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.250
Yes, I guess.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.130
Take this and put some stuff in your home.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:48.010
And get a new computer for your son too.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.490
Is Gi Dong Jae dead?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.930
I'm not sure.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.000
Well, probably?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.800
He deserves to die a hundred times over,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.400
but does a company's legal team leader

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.480
have to do a shit cleaning job like that too?

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.810
Jobs like this usually involve that.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.700
If you peel back the surface, it's all mud.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.770
Hyeongnim,

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.260
if you tell me to get into the mud, I will. However,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.510
knowing what's in that mud

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.190
would give me the courage to dip my entire body in it.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.330
An account under someone else's name.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.920
It's too big to sweep up by myself.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.940
That's why I need you.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.410
It's been what? Like ten years

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:06.730
since you and I have worked as partners.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:09.930
Here.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.540
Let's go together. Forever.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.430
Starting today,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:24.030
I'll be leading the Jeong Hui Joo murder case myself.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.170
Don't be scared because the opponent is TJ.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.580
Those guys went as far as to mess with our families.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.640
We're going to crash into them.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.460
Everyone should be ready for their heads to get smashed.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.230
If you don't, we won't be able to break TJ. Do you understand?

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:40.900
Yes, sir!

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.690
- Team Leader Woo.
- Yes?

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.860
Report on the progress of the investigation up to now.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.590
We confirmed the allegations against Gi Dong Jae and Choi Yong Geun,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:52.910
and to get an idea of who's behind this, we need to bring them in for questioning. But the problem is,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.320
Gi Dong Jae was already released.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.880
What?

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.500
Why?

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.250
The Seoul MIU sent in a non-indictment claim to the prosecution.

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.160
And the warrant request we sent is still on hold.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.190
So that prosecutor is the problem.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.930
They don't want to deal with anything connected to TJ.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.200
They would rather let Gi Dong Jae go and wash their hands of everything.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.170
The Seoul MIU gave the prosecution an excuse to release him.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.210
People are losing interest in Jeong Hui Joo's murder because the Woo Tae Ho and Cheon Na Na situation is a bigger problem.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:22.460
Only when we return the Jeong Hui Joo case to the media's focus will the prosecution make a move.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.730
What should we do? We need to make some noise.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.510
Today, the audit department called me in.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.800
It's nonsense, but I think they're going to hold onto it until the very end.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.070
Don't worry about that.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.950
I'll block it, even if I have to go to the commissioner and throw a fit.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.160
To the commissioner? You will?

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.630
The chief has no one to be afraid of right now.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.860
Who's the person who does whatever they want in the police force? The 'OGS'.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.820
The 'officer' who 'gave' up on being a 'superintendent.'

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.600
No one can touch that.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.870
Chief, you're the best. The king.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.790
I never said I'm an 'OGS' with my own mouth.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.130
Applause for the invincible 'OGS', Chief Moon Sang Beom!

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.230
- Let's go! 'OGS'!
- Hey, hey.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.520
You little.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.570
I'm not saying to block the audit on my corruption.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:09.820
I'm suggesting it be built up even further—huge.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.810
Hello. Hello. Oh my!

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.630
Nice to meet you.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.850
- I've been enjoying your streams.
- I see.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.350
I'm a true fan, really.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.860
Yes, yes.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.700
I have some intel for you.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.970
If this goes on air, it'll be huge!

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.210
Excuse me. I'm not the kind of person that takes requests to stream things.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.750
Come on, I know all about it.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.320
- Look.
- Okay, okay.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.580
This is a good price, right?

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.310
Okay?

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.790
Chaebol's son-in-law's death was a very interesting incident, right?

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.070
However, there was an even darker thing hidden behind it.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:03.500
An important supporting role enters the scene here.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.290
It's no other than, a police officer.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:09.040
A single officer who was in charge of the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.600
According to a reliable source of information from the police,

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.500
this office is being audited for corruption.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:21.090
He tried to get a friend's daughter released by abusing his power as a police officer.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.290
He's just the same old corrupted cop, but the problem is,

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.780
this officer took bribes from TJ,

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.960
and tried to cover up the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.050
Now, Jeong Hui Joo was an employee of TJ Group.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.580
In TJ Group's view, this was a simple murder case of some low-ranked employee.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.690
But why? Why?

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:49.100
Why did TJ Group go as far as giving huge bribes to that corrupt cop

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.400
so that he'd get involved in it?

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.590
Hyeong, is it really okay to spend this much?

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.530
Don't worry.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.310
It's money that's leaving the account of a Gangnam building owner.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.690
Keep going, man.

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.950
Should we have a glass of wine?

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.950
No.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.120
I have a meeting this afternoon.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.500
Did Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo contact you?

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.840
Never. I wouldn't answer even if he did.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.020
Especially when the shareholder's meeting is soon.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.730
You want to stay away from all these unnecessary meetings.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.640
How about McQueen? Did they choose a direction?

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.600
What do you say?

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.680
Cancel.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.330
Okay. I'll relay your opinion to the McQueen side.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.420
I'm thinking about going to America for a bit after the shareholder's meeting

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.060
to clear my head, too.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.530
I want to have a meeting with the chairman of McQueen while I'm there.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.310
Can you set that up?

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.690
Yeah. I'd love to do that.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.990
He likes beautiful women.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.620
Tae Ho's incident raised some noise.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.640
How is that going?

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.060
It's a moment.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.640
Once it's passed, it'll just dissolve.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.190
What do you think, Na Na?

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.690
It's not something I can easily think about clearly.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.280
I think it'll take some time.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.020
You two shouldn't worry about that.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.290
I'll be handling it on my own.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:33.270
To Tae Ho's family, show deep penitence and pay them well.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.320
He contributed to us greatly.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:40.680
I mean, what did he do for us?

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.820
On the contrary, he tried to steal everything from us.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.220
Contribution comes first, not fault.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.350
That's the right thing to do for the dead.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:49.560
Yes.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.700
I called the shareholders.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:56.710
I relayed that you, Sang Woo, would be the CEO in my place,

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.290
and I received mostly positive responses.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.110
I just need to persuade the McQueen side of things.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.520
I'll take care of that side.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.370
- Are you saying this with your friend Michael Cha in mind?
- Yes.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.950
- Are you confident?
- Yes.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.970
I thought I really didn't have good luck with my children.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.190
But I think I've raised my daughter

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.120
quite well.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.990
What did Na Na say?

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.650
She wants to meet with the chairman of McQueen in person.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.210
She wants to skip over me.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.810
What do you think her intention is?

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.570
What Na Na wants is the king.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.760
So?

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.330
Her ambition and ability are too far apart.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.380
That's the public opinion of the McQueen headquarters as well.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.320
Na Na will be quite upset. You're her friend.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.900
The reason I followed along with Director Cheon's opinion is not because I'm close with her.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.150
It's because she had someone like Woo Tae Ho.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.280
To be honest, in McQueen's eyes, Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo is not a good fit either.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.460
But instead of Director Cheon without Woo Tae Ho,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.420
we chose Vice Chairman Cheon, who has you.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:15.550
That means Tae Ho's death was good for Sang Woo and me.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.780
Well, whenever another person like Woo Tae Ho reappears,

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.690
our opinions will change again.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.500
That won't happen.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.820
A reporter from broadcasting will be here in a bit.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.880
You just need to say what's written there.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.910
Wow. Th-This is a bit...

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.100
I'm not telling you to lie.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.960
It's not totally a lie, but...

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.950
I mean...

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.430
You can do it, right?

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.800
Yes. Of course.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.650
Why don't I have anything?

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.480
Well, people with even a hint of positive feelings towards me can't do that interview.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.620
It shows.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.060
Positive feelings?

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.640
I don't know why you think─

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.180
Yes, Ms. Bo Kyeong.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.660
- Yes.
- I think this is too weak.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:07.670
I want to swear like you, f─, but it's a broadcast so I probably can't.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:18.130
This is the place where my grandfather, Cheon Tae Joo, the founder,

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:22.250
first came out into the world.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.340
And today, a hundred years later, I, Cheon Sang Woo,

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.020
am taking my first steps

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.000
as the third chairman of the board of directors here.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.680
It will be a difficult and heavy road.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.340
However, whenever I feel tired, burdened from all those difficulties,

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.410
I'll think of this place.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:46.490
The founder's hundred-year feat of TJ
[Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo, becomes TJ Group's CEO]

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:50.070
will be deeply ingrained in me.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.330
You can't. Not without my permission.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.120
With me, the history of TJ

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.930
will begin again from here.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.910
It will be the first step towards becoming the world's number one.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.290
- Could we possibly
- With the determination that...

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.550
get that guy?

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.730
- Maybe,
- If TJ collapses, Korea will collapse.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.230
- it might be easier to snatch a star from the sky.
- We will

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.430
become a tree with deeper roots.
[First Interview at former home of Cheon Tae Joo, founder of TJ]

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:43.380
Thank you.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.450
That's a lot of pride.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.920
"If TJ collapses, Korea will collapse."

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.720
However, the current state of TJ is no joke, right?

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.240
Yes. First of all, Chairman of Honor Cheon Seong Dae is in jail,

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.150
and there was a car accident where the son-in-law died.

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:07.450
In addition, recently, there is also unsavory news regarding the murder case of Jeong Hui Joo,

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.170
who was a TJ Group employee.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.520
Right. Was that mentioned in an independent news stream online?

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.540
Yes, that's right. Not only on the internet but even offline there's a huge wave of interest.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.520
We went in a little deeper.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.010
Let's take a look.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:24.960
He was in the Seoul MIU and came to our station a year ago.
[Police Station Detective: Kang]

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.090
He's such a freak, so I can't really tell what he thinks,

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:33.150
but I heard that he was involved in a TJ case.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.660
But if you think about it, a huge company like TJ

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.550
bribing a detective at an inspector level?

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.550
Isn't that a bit too low of them?

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.370
It might make sense if someone higher up took it.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.070
What do you mean by higher up?

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.070
I don't know too much about it,

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:54.580
but I heard that person quit the force and is a high-ranking official on TJ's legal team.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.550
It's just something I heard.

00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:00.750
I don't have official sources, so it's not a proven fact.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.530
- What bullshit are these bastards planning?
- Wait no. Edit this out later.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.380
Apparently, he has a building in Gangnam.
[Police Station Detective: Kwon]

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.640
In Gangnam, you know?

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.480
He doesn't know what a card limit is.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.140
Do you think that's possible on a detective's salary?

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.560
He's the type of person who thinks money means everything.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.460
He's the trash of the trash.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.660
He likes money and women. He's total scum.
[TJ Group Employee: Ms. B]

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.690
I was tricked by his handsomeness.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.880
I made a huge mistake.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.110
Not long ago, I let him meet with the top management of our company.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:38.040
In a very secret place, too.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:42.320
I really didn't know that he was such a sociopath.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.480
In the end, it turns out that this corrupt detective

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.420
had a secret deal with one of TJ's top executives

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.100
in relation to the murder case of TJ's employee Jeong Hui Joo.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.220
None of the stories were confirmed yet.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.170
However, as the corruption issue broke this time,

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:03.060
the forgotten Jeong Hui Joo case is becoming a hot topic.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.560
Currently, on the Blue House's online forum,

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.880
there are hundreds of thousands of petitions

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.650
asking to reveal the truth of Jeong Hui Joo's murder case.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.980
Yes, I understand.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.540
The prosecution accepted the additional charge request.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.020
Capture Gi Dong Jae and let's officially investigate again.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:25.170
Gi Dong Jae will be hard to find.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:29.290
Well, we should get him no matter what. We have to get his confession to find out who's behind all of this.

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.790
Gi Dong Jae wasn't released so he could survive.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.550
They let him go to kill him.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:36.930
Then what are you suggesting?

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.430
He's not the brains anyway.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:42.990
We get Choi Yong Geun first, and then,

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.570
we'll have to snatch that star in the sky.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.350
I heard Gi Dong Jae was released.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:57.800
I hope he didn't run far away with his girlfriend.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.100
We gave our team members false hope. It better not be a dead end.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:08.040
No, I have a feeling. I think we're going to hit a home run.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.800
Home run for a guy like me? No way.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:15.460
What's wrong with you? You got third place in a lottery not so long ago!

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.410
That's no home run.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:21.990
First place was more than a million! Just because of a single number.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:27.510
I lost 999,000,000 won (~$999,000)!

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:31.680
Nothing has worked out for me since then.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.650
Here it comes, our home run.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:39.610
Catching a culprit is a home run for a detective.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.190
One moment, please.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.460
Excuse me.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.470
What is it?

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:57.070
By any chance, are you familiar with the crime of concealment of evidence?

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:58.990
What? What's that?

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.540
What it is?

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.500
That asshole Gi Dong Jae killed someone and messed up two detectives.

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.000
However, the evidence for all of that is on that phone.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.920
If you hide that phone,

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.630
it becomes concealment of evidence.

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:14.650
However, handing over Gi Dong Jae's phone to a detective?

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:18.260
In that case, you'll get noticed for cooperating with the investigation,

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.810
and get a model citizen award.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.760
On top of that, there's reward money too.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.480
It's the equivalent of third place in the lottery.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.100
Hyeong, why are you...?

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.990
Here.

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:33.500
Will you choose handcuffs? Or, excluding tax,

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.770
choose the award money of one million won (~$1,000)?

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.970
I'm telling you, I don't know.

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.910
Detective Oh Ji Hyeok put in his vacation and went somewhere.

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.460
South Pole.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.960
He went to the South Pole to meet the penguins.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.460
- Is that good?
- No, it's not.

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.760
That's not me, I said.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.630
Why would I swear? I'm telling you, it's not me.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:56.200
I'm hanging up anyway.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.060
Hey, put down all the phones in the office.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.560
Didn't we make this too big?

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.920
There are only allegations and no evidence.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.340
All will be cleared when I reveal that it's my father's money that I inherited after dragging things a bit.

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.030
But even then.

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:15.180
- Yes?
- He's a building owner. Whatever.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.080
Hello?

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.020
Detective Oh.

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.590
- Please help me.
- Director Cheon?

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.380
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Police Station.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.290
Gyeonggi Region, Yangpyeon City, Sungsa-myeon, Ohcheon-ro 101.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:33.310
Send nearby officers and also call an ambulance.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:36.050
A woman sent a rescue request.

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.830
I think it's somewhere in Gyeonggi Province.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:51.530
- Hey!
- I'll look at the navigation and let you know when I get to the car.

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.220
- I heard you found Gi Dong Jae's Cellphone.
- What about Jeong Hui Joo's body?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.580
Yes.

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.440
Where are you?

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.830
This is... let's see.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:01.230
I think it's somewhere in Gyeonggi Province.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.930
I'll look at the navigation and let you know when I get to the car.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:06.030
What about Jeong Hui Joo's body?

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.270
There's not much difference from the photo.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.570
It'll definitely look like this was done by the serial killer.

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:13.780
Do you wear gloves?

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.810
- Of course.
- What about your shoes?

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.740
I covered it well, so I won't leave any footprints, as you told me.

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.010
Okay. Your DNA might be left on the gown. Think about it carefully.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:24.050
Did you ever hold it with your bare hands?

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.230
I brought the gown after laundering it,

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.860
and I was wearing my gloves, so that's not possible.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.670
You remember the way you came, right? Go exactly back that way.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:36.020
The branches might have scratched your clothes or touched your skin.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.660
Any suspicious branches, break them off and burn them.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.000
Okay.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.760
The car that you used to move the body? Drive it a bit,

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:48.180
and then drown it. Even if you take it to a junkyard or burn it, the DNA stays. Put it in water no matter what.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:52.110
And check if there's any evidence in there before you dump it.

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:55.130
Burn all your belongings until everything becomes ash.

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.240
Okay, I will.

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.630
We got Choi Yong Geun.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.870
Finally, I feel like I deserve to see

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:08.320
Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather.

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.360
I'm Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Station's Violent Crimes Team 2. What's the status?

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.760
Yes, when we got here, the caller had already recovered,

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.940
and according to her, she had diabetic shock.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.680
- Where is she?
- She's inside.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.490
She said we can just go because her friend is coming.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:33.220
I understand. Thank you for your work.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.210
Yes.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.600
Why are you torturing me so much? Why?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.000
What did I do to you to deserve this? Huh?

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.300
Why?

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:25.550
I told you to sneak out what he hid, not to use it yourself!

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.450
What is it that you want?

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.200
Money?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.970
Or do you want me to divorce Woo Tae Ho and put him in your arms?

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.630
Return Min Ji's child to her.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.220
I mean why are you...?

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.710
Why are you concerning yourself with Kim Min Ji's child?

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.000
She has nothing to say to me.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.280
I did enough for her.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.980
Vice Chairman,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.400
you took Min Ji's everything.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.640
So?

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.000
If I really don't give that child back,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.660
you'll give that security camera footage to the police?

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.620
Yes.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.700
Try it.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.950
I just need to get a lawyer and get released.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.000
But what do you think will happen to you?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.870
Your life will probably become hell.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.370
I'm doing this with that in mind.

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.230
Is that so?

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.630
What about your grandfather, who owns a shoe store?

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:37.030
He didn't seem so well.

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.020
What are you saying right now?

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:44.110
I was just thinking your grandfather might see hell first,

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.890
even before you.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.510
That footage,

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.810
should I send it to Director Cheon?

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:58.300
I think the chairman would see it if I did that.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.070
Aren't you more afraid of them than the police?

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:03.860
What?

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.210
And if the chairman knew why you assaulted Min Ji

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:10.780
he would be even more disappointed in you.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.400
Are you

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.830
threatening me right now?

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.110
How dare someone as lowly as you threaten me?

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:25.860
You're used to it. These kinds of threats.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.230
What?

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.750
You beat up an innocent woman to death's door,

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:34.660
and to hide that crime, you steal her child and threaten her.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:38.590
You even brought a frail old man into this just to threaten me.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:42.380
Compared to that, this isn't even a threat.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.240
You really

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:47.200
want to die, don't you?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.900
Sit down!

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.530
Return Min Ji's child.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.860
This is the last chance I can give you.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.140
Hey!

01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.710
Hey!

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:02.150
Stop there, right now!

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.350
Hey!

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:18.940
Hey!

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.180
Kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo.

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:39.100
I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations,

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.890
so kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo!

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:44.200
Department Lead Choi will take care of the rest,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.670
so Gi Dong Jae,

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.660
all you need to do is kill her!

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.810
Do you understand?

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.410
Thank you for saving me.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.190
I'm giving you this in return.

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:09.970

This is an arrest warrant for Mr. Choi Yong Geun.

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.550
The evidence is clear. He can't get away.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.290
I'll see you soon, Vice Chairman.

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.840
Would you be in this place if Tae Ho were around?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.550
Why are you suddenly showing your true self when all you did until now was hide things?

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.970
Why did Woo Tae Ho die?

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.250
That belongs to the person who shares a bed with me.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.370
Why?

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.810
If you were a prosecutor, would you prosecute Cheon Sang Woo?

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.800
How are you going to deal with the aftermath?

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.880
Will you reveal the real culprit, or will you take all the blame?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.170
The police have issued a subpoena for you.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.950
Get her on your side no matter what.
