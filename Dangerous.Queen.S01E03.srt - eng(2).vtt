00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:39.928
Get in.

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:42.335
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:43.303
I’m all wet.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.735
I’ll pay you.

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:45.821
Get in the car with me.

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:46.665
How much do you want?

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:48.734
I don’t do that kind of work.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.947
You won this time.

00:01:50.947 --> 00:01:52.574
But next time you might lose it all.

00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:54.694
What did you just say?!

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:56.419
You said I would lose it all?!

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:58.495
Did you just curse me, Bo?!

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.151
How dare you?!

00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:06.233
Who did this to you?

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:07.726
I’m really fine.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.707
I’m sorry, Bo.

00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:13.132
I didn’t mean to do that, Bo.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.457
You can hit me, Bo! Hit me!

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:16.773
Stop!

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:25.350
Is there something urgent, Mom?

00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:40.239
I heard many board members don’t agree with you becoming president.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:43.123
Yes.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.375
I don’t want you caught in that situation.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.068
It might be best if you stepped down.

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:58.345
Usually, you never give up on things like this, Mom.

00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:01.788
Especially when you know it’s unfair.

00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:06.944
But you don’t have to play their game.

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.770
I’d like you to go into politics.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:15.303
Our party needs new blood to compete with the others.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.845
I’ve set everything up for you.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:22.459
You just have to say yes.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.717
Our party?

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:36.042
You can be honest with me.

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.649
You just want to do what Wasin wants, right?

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:48.325
You don’t want me caught up in those people’s game.

00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.974
But you want me in your game instead, don’t you, Mom?

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:53.272
That’s not what I think.

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:02.355
Queen.

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:05.048
Everything I do is all for you.

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.637
I won’t step down as president.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:19.063
Dad entrusted this company to me.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.902
The only reason I’d ever step down…

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.973
is if King takes the position instead of me.

00:04:40.964 --> 00:04:41.812
Please, no.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.103
There’s one more thing.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.439
Election day is approaching.

00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:58.373
You must be more careful.

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:00.922
Don’t let there be any bad press.

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:03.133
It could affect the party.

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.942
I don’t want your father upset over this.

00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:21.026
I only have one father.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.195
I’ll be more careful.

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:32.924
Please, excuse me.

00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:14.070
(I've looked for more information.)
(Last night, Babe was beaten by her mother.)
(And just now too, but someone stepped in to help.)

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.947
What is it?

00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:34.111
(Queen.)

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.224
(I dug up more information about Babe.)

00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:38.006
Babe’s mother is a gambling addict.

00:06:38.692 --> 00:06:40.370
And she keeps stealing money too.

00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:48.014
Come on…

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:50.594
Last night you left my message on read.

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.648
And now you’re not even talking to me?

00:06:57.121 --> 00:06:57.969
Queen.

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.528
Do you actually want to know about Babe?

00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:03.059
(I’ve been running around all night to dig this up.)

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.287
(Didn’t even get a wink of sleep.)

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:11.731
Queen?!

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.604
Did she just hang up on me?!

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:20.015
Queen!!!

00:07:22.904 --> 00:07:23.752
What?!

00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:54.294
Is it in here?!

00:08:00.328 --> 00:08:01.578
Where did she put it?!

00:08:04.748 --> 00:08:05.596
(Bo!)

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:07.296
(Bo!)

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:09.930
(Bo!)

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:13.576
(Bua!)

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.678
(Bua!)

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:16.951
Hang on!

00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:21.614
What is it?!

00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:23.285
Bo isn’t home, Bua?

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.085
How would I know?

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:26.894
I haven’t seen her, I just got here.

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:28.515
What do you want from her?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.758
It’s nothing.

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:34.110
By the way…

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:35.330
What?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.775
I already paid off your debt at the den, Bua.

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:39.367
What?!

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:41.502
Seriously?!

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:42.997
For real?!

00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:43.741
Did I hear you right?!

00:08:43.741 --> 00:08:45.981
Yes, for real.

00:08:48.693 --> 00:08:50.467
You’re amazing, Kem!

00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:52.251
Why weren’t you born my son?!

00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.666
I’d love you to death!

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.043
Wait, Bua.

00:08:55.947 --> 00:08:57.331
But you have to promise me one thing.

00:08:57.713 --> 00:08:58.641
What is it?

00:08:59.848 --> 00:09:01.500
Can you promise not to hit Bo again?

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:03.683
Fine!

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:06.885
Fine! I promise!

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:12.416
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:17.347
That debt you paid for me…

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:18.844
I’ll take it as the dowry.

00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:25.932
I know you’ve had a crush on Bo since forever.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.354
That’s why I’m giving her to you.

00:09:29.846 --> 00:09:31.846
Silence? I'll take that as a yes.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:33.939
Well, since we’re at it…

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.814
How about a little more?

00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:38.783
Bua?!

00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:40.204
I’m completely out!

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:42.611
That was all of my savings.

00:09:42.611 --> 00:09:44.389
Come on, Kem!

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.332
You love Bo this much.

00:09:46.332 --> 00:09:49.087
And she’s only worth 200,000 to you?!

00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:51.125
What a chicken.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.338
I’ll just give her to someone else.

00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.698
Wait! Bua!

00:09:57.719 --> 00:09:59.210
I’ll get more for you.

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:05.387
That’s my son-in-law!

00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:06.675
Okay…

00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:25.414
You actually fit in my clothes, Bo!

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.830
If I could go home, I wouldn’t be bothering you this much.

00:10:31.356 --> 00:10:33.838
Come on, don’t think too much about it.

00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:35.639
If you went home…

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.715
your face will get more bruises for sure.

00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.460
So just use my stuff for now.

00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:44.966
Thanks, Mint.

00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:47.906
Bo!

00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:49.688
They just posted it!

00:10:50.376 --> 00:10:54.894
Let’s go check! I’m dying to know if your name is on the list.

00:10:54.894 --> 00:10:56.234
Come on, hurry!

00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:03.264
Hurry up!

00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:04.830
Excuse me, sorry!

00:11:10.187 --> 00:11:10.928
Bo!

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:11.880
Bo!

00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:14.063
You made it, Bo!

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:15.534
Your name’s right there!

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:19.751
The interview’s tomorrow. You have to nail it, Bo!

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:22.751
Fingers crossed.

00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:25.015
This scholarship is my only hope.

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:28.020
If you get it…

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.842
You won’t have to pay tuition anymore.

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:32.204
And when you graduate, you’ll have a guaranteed job!

00:11:32.204 --> 00:11:34.716
I’m so excited for you!

00:11:34.716 --> 00:11:37.464
And you especially, you’ll definitely make it, Bo!

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.583
I hope so too.

00:11:45.077 --> 00:11:45.978
You got this.

00:12:17.228 --> 00:12:18.014
(I love you.)

00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:19.991
Will you be my girlfriend, Bo?

00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:24.182
We’re friends, Kem.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:28.907
Bo.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.010
Can you give me a chance?

00:12:31.582 --> 00:12:33.260
It's not about giving chances.

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:35.337
But it’s about feelings.

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:36.436
I do love you, Kem.

00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:38.494
But I love you as a friend.

00:12:38.895 --> 00:12:40.681
And I've never felt more than that.

00:12:58.308 --> 00:12:58.995
So…

00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:01.983
I heard you like Bua’s daughter?

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:06.373
But you’re looking pathetic like this…

00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:08.942
Guess you couldn’t make her yours.

00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:13.211
I want to be alone.

00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:19.346
Why are you such an idiot?

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:22.923
There’s nothing special about a girl like that.

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:25.617
She’s just playing hard to get.

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.340
Just toss her some cash.

00:13:36.321 --> 00:13:39.205
And she’ll come crawling back to you.

00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:44.453
It’s my business!

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.583
I’ll deal with it myself!

00:13:49.278 --> 00:13:50.849
Especially Bua’s daughter…

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.094
She’s no different from her mother.

00:13:55.318 --> 00:13:57.157
You don’t know a thing, shut up!

00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:05.751
Did you just raise your voice at me, Kem?

00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:07.185
Huh?!

00:14:09.194 --> 00:14:10.658
I’m telling you this…

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:13.538
That girl will bleed you dry.

00:14:14.204 --> 00:14:15.052
So what?!

00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:17.262
You paid off Bua’s debt…

00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:21.313
But you still couldn’t make that girl yours.

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:26.214
That girl’s got some nerve.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.497
Already played you for your money.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.724
Why are you such a fool over a worthless girl?

00:14:34.068 --> 00:14:34.809
Huh?!

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:36.254
Stay out of my business!

00:14:56.587 --> 00:14:58.024
I’ll let you go this time.

00:15:01.289 --> 00:15:02.592
Take it as…

00:15:04.143 --> 00:15:06.143
I pity a fool like you.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:11.209
But if you dare mouth off at me again.

00:15:12.813 --> 00:15:14.574
I won’t let you off next time, Kem!

00:15:22.775 --> 00:15:23.596
Let’s go!

00:16:39.024 --> 00:16:40.133
Where’s Bie?

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.769
She’s already booked for the night.

00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:46.124
For real?

00:16:46.298 --> 00:16:48.588
Who’d even have the guts to book Queen’s girl?

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:52.409
That table over there.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.020
Queen.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.322
This is the list of students applying for our company’s scholarship this year.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.014
Come pick a wine with me.

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:55.817
Yes.

00:19:40.069 --> 00:19:41.295
I booked this girl for the night.

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:43.492
But I'll let you have her.

00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:15.395
I’m going to the restroom.

00:20:21.242 --> 00:20:22.216
Queen.

00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:24.322
About last night…

00:20:24.713 --> 00:20:25.397
I…

00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:40.144
Does it hurt?

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:42.955
What are you talking about?

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:44.727
All the bruises.

00:20:46.932 --> 00:20:47.595
No, it doesn’t.

00:20:50.195 --> 00:20:51.208
What happened?

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:55.038
Please, I’d rather not talk about it.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.899
If you want my help…

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:01.016
Just say it.

00:21:05.273 --> 00:21:06.441
Even if I tell you…

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.062
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:45.327
Queen.

00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:47.738
Has Bie really got you this shaken?

00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:49.543
What are you saying?

00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:51.099
I’m just being honest.

00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:52.744
I’m only saying what I see.

00:21:53.274 --> 00:21:54.558
We've been friends for years.

00:21:54.558 --> 00:21:56.141
How could I not see it?

00:21:56.993 --> 00:21:57.715
There’s nothing.

00:21:58.697 --> 00:21:59.400
No way.

00:21:59.948 --> 00:22:01.348
If there’s really nothing, why are you here then?

00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:04.914
I just don’t want anyone being used by Kongtup.

00:22:05.878 --> 00:22:06.503
That’s all.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.428
(Don’t forget your papers.)
(I'm going to bed.)

00:22:27.352 --> 00:22:28.829
(This headache won’t quit.)

00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.224
Papers…

00:22:35.235 --> 00:22:35.841
Right!

00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:38.098
They’re still at home.

00:23:21.174 --> 00:23:22.342
Well, well…

00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:23.978
Pretending you don’t care.

00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:26.730
But here you are, right in front of Babe’s house.

00:23:27.564 --> 00:23:28.209
Stop it.

00:23:31.586 --> 00:23:32.947
Since I’ve been with you…

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:37.643
Babe’s the first person you’ve ever been this into.

00:23:38.437 --> 00:23:40.611
So what do we call that…?

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.629
You talk too much.

00:23:43.052 --> 00:23:43.832
Just leave.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.316
You can fool me or anyone else.

00:23:48.714 --> 00:23:50.017
But your own heart…

00:23:50.277 --> 00:23:51.890
you can’t fool that, Queen.

00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:53.275
Leave.

00:23:56.262 --> 00:23:57.062
Hold on.

00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:03.685
Kongtup’s men are watching you, Queen.

00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:33.596
Bo!

00:25:34.397 --> 00:25:35.081
Bo!

00:25:35.693 --> 00:25:37.024
Are you home, Bo?

00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:38.167
Bo!

00:25:38.748 --> 00:25:40.121
Are you home?

00:25:43.201 --> 00:25:43.989
Bo!

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.721
I’m sorry, Bo.

00:25:47.487 --> 00:25:48.233
Bo!

00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:50.956
Bo!

00:25:51.814 --> 00:25:53.041
I’m so sorry.

00:25:53.446 --> 00:25:54.151
Bo!

00:25:55.073 --> 00:25:56.592
Please open the door for me, Bo.

00:25:58.437 --> 00:25:59.309
Bo!

00:26:04.014 --> 00:26:04.739
Bo.

00:26:06.858 --> 00:26:07.625
Bo.

00:26:09.918 --> 00:26:10.790
Bo.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.410
I’m sorry.

00:26:15.749 --> 00:26:16.454
Bo.

00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:18.755
Please open the door for me.

00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:21.451
Bo.

00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:22.779
I’m so sorry.

00:26:23.566 --> 00:26:24.354
Bo.

00:26:25.692 --> 00:26:26.480
Bo.

00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:28.914
Bo.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.245
Bo.

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:33.372
Bo.

00:26:33.924 --> 00:26:35.130
I’m sorry.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.029
Please come back to me, Bo.

00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:39.272
Please.

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.863
I'm sorry, Bo.

00:26:41.987 --> 00:26:43.360
I was wrong.

00:27:07.742 --> 00:27:08.551
Kem!

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:10.474
Open the door!

00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:12.053
Kem! It’s bad!

00:27:12.053 --> 00:27:14.234
Kem! This is serious!

00:27:15.097 --> 00:27:15.726
Kem!

00:27:15.726 --> 00:27:17.254
(I’m coming!)

00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:18.562
Open the door, hurry!

00:27:19.024 --> 00:27:20.105
What is it, Bua?!

00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:22.452
Bo ran away from home!

00:27:22.452 --> 00:27:24.821
She took everything with her!

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:26.430
What?!

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.863
Since when?!

00:27:28.299 --> 00:27:29.317
I don’t know!

00:27:29.317 --> 00:27:33.213
I came home this morning and all her stuff was gone!

00:27:34.709 --> 00:27:36.709
How am I supposed to get by now?!

00:27:37.962 --> 00:27:38.938
Bo!

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.644
You ungrateful daughter!

00:27:49.557 --> 00:27:50.429
What is this?!

00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:02.003
(Answer me, Bo!!!!!)
(Where are you?!)
(You ungrateful daughter!!!)

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.361
(I’m your mother!)
(Come home right now!)
(You worthless child!!)

00:28:05.662 --> 00:28:06.638
Just turn it off already!

00:28:08.876 --> 00:28:09.581
Mm…

00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:13.940
I thought my life was bad enough…

00:28:14.176 --> 00:28:16.615
But compared to you, I’ve got nothing.

00:28:18.336 --> 00:28:18.999
Yeah…

00:28:27.157 --> 00:28:27.778
Bo.

00:28:28.241 --> 00:28:30.956
You have to nail it today.

00:28:36.595 --> 00:28:37.216
Mmm.

00:28:40.092 --> 00:28:40.734
You got this!

00:28:44.564 --> 00:28:45.122
Right…

00:28:46.294 --> 00:28:48.294
Good morning, everyone.

00:28:49.053 --> 00:28:51.366
For this final round of scholarship interviews.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.352
The committee will assess candidates on multiple aspects.

00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.820
The committee’s decision will be final.

00:28:59.547 --> 00:29:00.565
I wish you all the best of luck.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.179
I’m rooting for you all.

00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:10.956
You got this.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.803
I got this.

00:29:17.104 --> 00:29:17.829
You got this!

00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:26.354
From all the applications we’ve reviewed.

00:29:26.685 --> 00:29:28.455
Two candidates stand out the most.

00:29:30.037 --> 00:29:32.037
I believe there’s only one.

00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:34.636
Who would that be?

00:29:35.621 --> 00:29:36.555
Warataya.

00:29:37.346 --> 00:29:38.197
And for you?

00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:40.956
Bonita and Warataya.

00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:46.479
What do you think, Keeraphat?

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:52.317
Warataya is certainly impressive.

00:29:55.187 --> 00:29:57.960
In that case, we’ll proceed with awarding the scholarship to Warataya.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.417
But Bonita is just as impressive.

00:30:18.168 --> 00:30:19.332
Bonita.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.540
Just make the decision fairly.

00:30:27.182 --> 00:30:28.137
No need to favor me.

00:30:58.964 --> 00:30:59.606
Good morning.

00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:01.066
My name is…

00:31:02.135 --> 00:31:03.341
Bonita Piansakul.

00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:05.179
I’m a second-year student in the Faculty of Economics.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.325
The results have been finalized.

00:31:57.266 --> 00:32:00.457
This year’s scholarship goes to…

00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:09.548
Warathaya Suksorn.

00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:10.666
Congratulations.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.060
Don’t worry, you’ll definitely get it next year.

00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:42.452
Mmm…

00:32:43.248 --> 00:32:44.370
Thanks for waiting for me.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.515
I saw Queen just now.

00:32:50.598 --> 00:32:52.034
She was one of the committee members.

00:32:53.224 --> 00:32:53.724
What?!

00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:54.755
Really?!

00:32:55.183 --> 00:32:57.350
Then why didn’t she help you?!

00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:58.913
Why would she?

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:01.327
The decision should be fair.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.005
The one who got it deserves it too.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.690
And I don’t want any of that special treatment kind of thing.

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:10.170
I want to earn it on my own.

00:33:24.515 --> 00:33:25.637
If you want my help…

00:33:26.654 --> 00:33:27.609
Just say it.

00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:29.644
Even if I tell you…

00:33:29.644 --> 00:33:31.342
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

00:33:34.449 --> 00:33:34.949
Bo?

00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:37.869
Bo?

00:33:39.883 --> 00:33:40.734
Are you heading back now?

00:33:43.192 --> 00:33:44.628
I forgot to tell you.

00:33:44.993 --> 00:33:46.408
I have to go see Ging’s mom for a bit.

00:33:47.774 --> 00:33:49.105
Is it okay if you head back first?

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:50.800
Of course!

00:33:51.118 --> 00:33:52.491
Don’t worry about me.

00:33:53.428 --> 00:33:54.133
Okay.

00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:56.857
See you at the club then. I’m feeling better now.

00:33:57.573 --> 00:33:59.134
Alright, see you there.

00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:00.131
Bye.

00:34:00.227 --> 00:34:00.869
Bye.

00:34:09.855 --> 00:34:10.852
This way, please, Keeraphat.

00:35:32.774 --> 00:35:35.799
We’re truly honored that you could join us today, Keeraphat.

00:35:36.174 --> 00:35:36.709
Thank you.

00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:41.156
We truly appreciate your continued support for our university’s scholarship program.

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:42.694
My pleasure.

00:35:43.152 --> 00:35:44.315
Have a safe trip back, Keeraphat.

00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:28.160
Jumping into someone else’s car like this…

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.702
Do you think it’s the right thing to do?

00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.730
No.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:36.910
So you do know…

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.490
Then why do it?

00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:41.786
You’d better have a good reason, Babe.

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:46.624
Could you drop me off at the university gate, please?

00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:52.510
Reason?

00:36:55.888 --> 00:36:56.988
Please, could you drop me off?

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.517
I want a reason why you jumped into my car.

00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:05.687
And why I should drop you off.

00:37:10.656 --> 00:37:13.409
Last night you told me I couldn’t help you.

00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:16.893
But now you’re asking for my help.

00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:20.528
If your reason isn’t good enough…

00:37:20.924 --> 00:37:22.234
Then you can get out of my car.

00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:27.701
I’m sorry.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.728
For the way I spoke to you last night.

00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:36.053
And for jumping into your car like this.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.761
It’s just there’s someone outside I don’t want to face.

00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:49.657
So, what do I get out of helping you this time?

00:37:50.478 --> 00:37:51.599
I’m not that kind.

00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:53.180
But you’re not mean to me.

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:02.692
If you won’t help…

00:38:03.485 --> 00:38:04.397
I’ll get out.

00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:07.733
Sorry for the trouble.

00:38:08.547 --> 00:38:09.657
If you want me to help…

00:38:13.389 --> 00:38:14.322
Then sit here.

00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:20.275
I’ve told you before that I don’t take that kind of job.

00:38:23.245 --> 00:38:24.657
I only told you to sit on my lap.

00:38:44.426 --> 00:38:45.463
On Queen’s lap?!

00:38:50.794 --> 00:38:52.899
You can just drop me off up ahead.

00:38:54.658 --> 00:38:56.177
I’ll take you home.

00:38:56.177 --> 00:38:57.425
I’m not going home!

00:39:01.107 --> 00:39:02.375
Then we're going to my place.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.272
Why did you bring me here?

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:23.236
I’m not going to do anything to you.

00:40:24.343 --> 00:40:26.343
But I’ve got work to do tonight.

00:40:27.681 --> 00:40:28.886
I’ll take you there.

00:40:29.658 --> 00:40:31.365
Then why did you bring me here?

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.479
It’s about work.

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:38.167
What work?

00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:43.429
I’m looking for someone to summarize and read the news to me.

00:40:45.398 --> 00:40:46.101
But…

00:40:46.641 --> 00:40:48.348
I just started working at the club.

00:40:50.041 --> 00:40:51.288
I don’t want to quit yet.

00:40:51.788 --> 00:40:53.914
I don’t offer this chance to just anyone, Babe.

00:41:35.277 --> 00:41:36.566
Do you live here alone, Queen?

00:41:38.635 --> 00:41:39.212
Mm.

00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:46.670
Living alone in such a big house…

00:41:47.212 --> 00:41:48.417
Don’t you ever feel lonely?

00:41:50.968 --> 00:41:51.775
I’m used to it.

00:41:56.176 --> 00:41:56.676
And…

00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:58.415
I brought you here to talk about work.

00:41:59.405 --> 00:42:00.673
Not to interview me.

00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:06.576
Alright.

00:42:24.495 --> 00:42:25.365
Are you going to sleep?

00:42:27.983 --> 00:42:28.560
No.

00:42:30.023 --> 00:42:31.207
Just resting my eyes.

00:42:49.658 --> 00:42:50.800
Are you feeling sore?

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.956
I can give you a massage.

00:42:57.556 --> 00:42:58.531
You know how to give a massage?

00:43:00.098 --> 00:43:00.989
A little bit.

00:43:19.852 --> 00:43:21.162
How much is it for a massage?

00:43:23.043 --> 00:43:23.725
I won’t charge.

00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:26.246
Think of it as payment for your help today.

00:43:36.004 --> 00:43:37.397
What if I like it?

00:43:41.894 --> 00:43:42.806
You mean me?

00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:48.223
What is there to like about you?

00:43:51.052 --> 00:43:52.194
I don’t know.

00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:55.448
I just feel like we’ve been seeing each other a lot lately.

00:43:56.157 --> 00:43:57.446
So it got me thinking that way.

00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:04.442
Then stop thinking that way.

00:44:06.072 --> 00:44:08.177
Because I'm not interested in you.

00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:13.729
Alright.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.302
Let me ask you something.

00:44:33.873 --> 00:44:35.706
Why don’t you want to go home?

00:44:40.197 --> 00:44:41.862
It’s not that I don’t want to.

00:44:47.846 --> 00:44:48.925
But I just can’t.

00:44:57.911 --> 00:44:58.677
Get up.

00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:00.758
I’ll take you to the club.

00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:35.639
Is this really Queen’s weak spot?

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:37.862
Yes, dad.

00:45:39.666 --> 00:45:41.282
Didn’t expect it’d be a girl from the club.

00:45:42.918 --> 00:45:44.304
This just makes things even more exciting.

00:45:46.058 --> 00:45:47.117
So, what’s your next move?

00:45:55.434 --> 00:45:56.436
I already have a plan.

00:45:59.031 --> 00:46:01.338
You know Queen just as well as she knows you.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.884
So, you still have to be careful.

00:46:05.725 --> 00:46:06.362
Of course, Dad.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.755
You can trust me.

00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:11.918
You’ve always had my trust, Kongtup.

00:46:32.543 --> 00:46:34.255
I’ve booked you for the whole night.

00:46:36.086 --> 00:46:37.318
Why don’t you invite Linn here too?

00:46:38.675 --> 00:46:39.696
I want to sit alone.

00:46:40.384 --> 00:46:41.918
Then why would you have me here?

00:46:44.398 --> 00:46:45.400
I mean…

00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:48.613
It’s only you and me.

00:46:51.165 --> 00:46:53.837
But didn’t you just say you wanted to be alone?

00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:02.835
Order whatever you like.

00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:05.667
You’ll drink with me.

00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:11.750
Alright.

00:47:21.943 --> 00:47:24.193
May I have a Shirley Temple, please, Ray?

00:47:24.193 --> 00:47:25.410
Right away, Bie.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.862
So, which one is it? Queen’s weak spot or whatever?

00:47:35.315 --> 00:47:37.078
There’s no one here named Bonita.

00:47:38.392 --> 00:47:40.469
And seriously?! Being way up there…

00:47:40.845 --> 00:47:42.211
but falling for a girl like that.

00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:43.476
How is that even possible?

00:47:43.759 --> 00:47:45.759
How would I know?! Huh?!

00:47:45.997 --> 00:47:48.323
Just go find the girl before Queen leaves.

00:47:48.715 --> 00:47:49.697
Boss wants some good shots.

00:47:50.282 --> 00:47:50.823
Move!

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:51.813
Alright.

00:48:18.556 --> 00:48:19.154
Queen.

00:48:44.919 --> 00:48:45.536
Queen!

00:48:45.536 --> 00:48:46.625
Please, come with me!

00:48:48.654 --> 00:48:49.348
Where?

00:48:49.348 --> 00:48:50.502
You need to get out of here.

00:48:54.972 --> 00:48:56.338
Someone’s trying to blackmail you.

00:48:56.338 --> 00:48:57.982
I just heard them talking.

00:48:57.982 --> 00:48:59.400
You have to leave now.

00:49:01.162 --> 00:49:01.664
Queen!

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:04.366
Are you sure you heard it right?

00:49:05.512 --> 00:49:06.821
I really heard them.

00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:08.022
Please, believe me.

00:49:11.413 --> 00:49:12.358
So, you’re worried about me?

00:49:12.759 --> 00:49:13.319
Yes.

00:49:13.787 --> 00:49:15.173
I don’t want you to get into trouble.

00:49:16.814 --> 00:49:17.739
And why would I be in trouble?

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.918
They said I’m your weak spot.

00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:22.713
I don’t know what that means.

00:49:23.296 --> 00:49:24.874
But right now, we have to hurry.

00:49:35.586 --> 00:49:36.223
Come on!

00:49:38.919 --> 00:49:39.882
This way, Queen.

00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:50.573
Why are you smiling?!

00:49:51.087 --> 00:49:51.628
Come here!

00:49:57.544 --> 00:49:58.565
Come in here first.

00:50:00.787 --> 00:50:01.328
Come in.

00:50:10.197 --> 00:50:10.697
Hey.

00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:21.765
No one’s here.

00:50:21.765 --> 00:50:22.323
Let’s go, then.

00:50:26.397 --> 00:50:27.859
Hang in here for a bit, Queen.

00:50:27.859 --> 00:50:29.056
Just wait until they leave.

00:50:32.322 --> 00:50:34.322
We’re lucky I overheard them talking.

00:50:34.322 --> 00:50:36.923
As soon as I heard, I ran straight back to you.

00:50:36.923 --> 00:50:39.664
I was so scared, I couldn’t think of anything.

00:50:39.664 --> 00:50:41.760
All I knew was, I had to get you out.

00:50:43.267 --> 00:50:44.918
Do you think they’ll find us, Queen?

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.455
Stay quiet.

00:51:02.258 --> 00:51:03.029
They’re gone.

00:51:04.618 --> 00:51:05.504
Are you sure?

00:51:06.241 --> 00:51:07.473
I’d better go out and check first.

00:51:16.891 --> 00:51:17.470
Babe.

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:20.149
If I were to kiss you…

00:51:22.177 --> 00:51:22.987
How much would it cost me?

00:51:25.104 --> 00:51:26.202
Are you drunk?

00:51:28.625 --> 00:51:29.918
I’m completely conscious.

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.918
And I want what I asked for.

00:51:36.025 --> 00:51:37.199
You don’t need to pay.

00:51:38.013 --> 00:51:38.765
Because I’m not giving you that.

00:51:39.713 --> 00:51:40.638
We should get out of here.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:49.465
Queen.

00:51:50.836 --> 00:51:51.799
I’m not joking.

00:51:52.978 --> 00:51:53.918
I won’t allow that.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:56.393
I’m serious.

00:51:59.413 --> 00:52:00.587
So am I.

00:52:04.946 --> 00:52:06.005
You’re defying me.

00:52:10.331 --> 00:52:11.918
I could defy you even more.

00:52:19.264 --> 00:52:20.304
(Where are they?!)

00:52:20.772 --> 00:52:22.138
Just keep looking!

00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:46.745
Do you really like that girl?

00:52:46.745 --> 00:52:48.626
Why would you think that?

00:52:48.626 --> 00:52:51.496
Because I’ve never seen my little sister act this way with anyone before.

00:52:51.587 --> 00:52:52.877
Stop it, Kem!

00:52:52.877 --> 00:52:53.599
I won’t!

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:55.240
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

00:52:55.318 --> 00:52:56.374
Get in my car.

00:52:56.374 --> 00:52:57.839
I’m not getting in your car.

00:52:57.839 --> 00:52:59.280
Not until you apologize to me.

00:53:00.492 --> 00:53:01.954
I've found her weakness.

00:53:01.954 --> 00:53:05.038
And I know exactly how to make use of it.
