TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.095
You're the CEO now.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.722
Yes.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.393
I just became

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.354
the CEO now.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:04.814
But I have no employees…

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:08.568
or any money…

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.198
or any things to sell.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.117
But what I'm trying to say is,

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.953
Ms. Oh Mi-seon…

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.833
Will you come and work…

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.378
for Typhoon Trading…

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.132
as a trader?

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.068
Yes.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.575
I will.

ULCHI 4-GA TO ANYANG STATION

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.775
-Sir.
-Goodness.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.819
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.279
I came to pick up my cards.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.281
-Typhoon Trading?
-Yes, that's right.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.158
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.701
-It's 5,000 won.
-It's 5,000 won?

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.829
-Thank you for the business.
-Thank you.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.043
-The pink one?
-Yes.

-Hey.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.185
-You got here early.
-Yes.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.896
Have a cup of coffee.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.941
-Careful.
-Thank you.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.528
Oh, right.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.869
A present for you.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.205

-Yes.

Let's have a good run, Ms. Senior Staff.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.063
Thank you,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:34.983
Mr. CEO.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.695
CEO?

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.656
-You're the CEO now.
-Yes, you're right.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.035
Thank you for the coffee.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.156
Gosh, Typhoon Trading.

00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:26.409
So, where are you dumping these?

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.539
My dad hates leaving things here
for a prolonged period.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.791
When can we make money off these?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.377
I'm looking into it,
but there are two containers of these.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.380
It's a huge supply,

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.716
and the fabric is high quality,
so it's hard to handle.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:45.136
I'm considering
selling these to a company in China.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.221
Hey, before you send these to China,

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.476
let's leave Tae-poong some
so he can make a pair of pants.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.102
He must've wet them.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.358
You're laughing even harder than me.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.518
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.479
Do you have a habit
of coming over unannounced?

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:43.528
TYPHOON TRADING

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:46.405
These are the fax records

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.742
we exchanged with the Italian company
when we imported the fabric.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:52.078
They'll accept the return

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.455
after taking 30% of the fee,
so please send them there.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.791
Although it's 30%,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.129
we'll get more in return
with this kind of exchange rate.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.348
Why are you telling me this?

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.808
Because it was a promise,

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.561
a promise our company made.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.938
So you'd rather lose money
than your credibility?

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.525
What if I refuse?

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.026
Well, you can do that too,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.739
if you can sell those
at a higher price than the original.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.620
Why don't you
just hand over the company to me?

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.082
Then I'll give you enough money to get by.

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.882
You said my company was worthless,
so it's a surprise you want to buy it.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.509
There must be something important
at Typhoon Trading.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.181
There's nothing more important
than money to a businessman.

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:56.851
You know,

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.398
even if I agree to take the deal,

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.194
you'd be better off
staying out of the business.

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.945
People never change.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.782
You will fail again,
just as you did this time.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.743
Mr. Pyo.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.415
You should teach
those baby steps to Hyun-jun instead.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.542
I am currently

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.836
learning how to fly

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.672
from my father.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.509
I will fall

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.801
and fall

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.136
over and over again.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.930
Then one day,

00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.474
I will soar

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.102
high over your head, Mr. Pyo.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.812
Hand over the company?

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:26.524
How ridiculous.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:41.998
-This is Typhoon--
-Hey!

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.667
Why won't you people
ever pick up the phone?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.835
I just did.

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:05.438
Hey, Kang Tae-poong.

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:10.276
You have no idea
your fabric is gone, do you?

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:13.446
-Sorry? What fabric?
-These.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.408
Wait, why are these…

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.244
-Did you import these?
-What?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.539
-How do you have the exact same batch?
-Good grief.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.667
Didn't you say this was worth
26 years of your dad's life?

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.002
Doesn't this ring a bell?

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:29.670
No?

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.131
Last time,

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:36.218
you held onto all this fabric
and made a huge scene.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.305
-Yes.
-So when you had to unload these,

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:41.682
the parking lot was too tiny,
and you said you were broke.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.478
These are crooked,
and you can't let them go over.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:46.937
It'll cost more if it does.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:49.231
You have to make sure these are intact.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.858
You can always pay for more.

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.735
-I don't have money.
-Really?

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.195
Did it go over?

00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:56.530
It looked like
you had no more space to unload these,

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:59.950
and I knew it'd be tough for you two
if I unloaded them and left.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:04.789
So, I thought
I'd keep these in my truck for a while.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.167
But gosh,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.378
why didn't you pick up my calls?

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:14.298
Gosh, what are we going to do?

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:21.764
I kept paging Go Ma-jin,
but he never called me back.

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:27.019
And I finally got in contact with you.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.107
I'm sorry.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.483
A lot has happened.

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.777
Do you know how much I lost
while hauling these around

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.445
instead of loading stuff for my job?

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.073
Are you going to pay me for my labor?

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.369
-I will.
-With what? You lost everything.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.543
I didn't.

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.504
I didn't lose everything. I got these.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.172
Just these?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:12:00.386
The word already got around
about how you got duped by Mr. Pyo.

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:01.720
No.

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.973
I can sell these, Mr. Baek.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.101
I'll sell all of these!

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.395
-Are you serious?
-I'm dead serious!

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:11.730
All right. Go ahead and do that then.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.482
How many rolls do I have?

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.693
I knew a few were missing.

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.111
I knew it.

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.488
I felt like
I didn't unload everything back then.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.462
There will be no logistics cost,
so let's just return these.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:35.963
Where are the files?

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.842
Tae-poong is too overwhelmed
to notice that these are gone.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.135
It's the shipping contract.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:42.261
SHIPPING CHARTER CONTRACT

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.138
The quantity says 50,000.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.764
Take a look. It's 50,000 yds.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.058
The quantity must exactly be the same.

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:50.436
Do you know

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:54.315
how hard it was for me
to pocket this out of the office?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.860
It was a tough job.

00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:03.491
RELEASOR: TYPHOON TRADING
SUCCESSOR: PYO MERCHANT MARINE

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.617
This is yours.

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:07.244
Don't give me this out here.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.042
I deserve this.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:20.925
We have it by color.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:23.219
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.345
It sounds about right.

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.014
Off to Italy! Close it!

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.645
Lower the container!

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.075
3 DAYS AGO

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:48.118
There it is. It's the refund policy.

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.412
It's possible if there is no change
in quantity or quality.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.374
How many rolls did you say
there were in Mr. Baek's truck?

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:56.210
There were 100 rolls, so it's 5,000 m.

00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:58.879
But if Pyo Merchant Marine finds out that
10% went missing…

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:02.174
Then, Pyo Merchant Marine
wouldn't send it for a refund.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.801
That's why

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.844
I took a closer look and realized…

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.137
Where is it?

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.764
Look at the quantity.

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.724
It's missing the unit.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.393
So what if I make it seem like…

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.520
You know, that thing.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:19.316
How about we
make them think it's in yards?

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.570
-Yards?
-Yes, so it'd be 50,000 yds, not 50,000 m.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:26.448
Then 50,000 yds would be 45,000 m,
exactly what Pyo has now.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.954
I think they'll return it
if the quantity matches.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.455
That'd be the most helpful.

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:39.044
Who's going to tell them that?
It'll be suspicious if you do it randomly.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.800
Well, someone who wishes
Typhoon Trading would go down

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.721
or someone who resents me.

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:51.056
Or…

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.570
You two were here.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.573
You haven't shut the place down?
Why do I care?

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.283
Mr. Kang Tae-poong.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.036
What's this? Why did you send me this?

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.203
SAVINGS ACCOUNT, GO MA-JIN

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.748
Are you trying
to make me feel uncomfortable?

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:19.001
I do not feel uncomfortable at all.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.128
Not only couldn't I care less
about this business,

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.464
but above all, I find you,
Mr. Kang Tae-poong,

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:25.591
just awful.

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.720
-We found him.
-We did.

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.099
What?

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:43.817
He's gone.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:48.948
Take this.

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.408
You earned this.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.577
So what? Do you expect me to keep it?

00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:56.080
That's called fraud, people.

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.623
No matter how much I think about it,

00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.126
I don't look anything like a traitor,
so why did it have to be me?

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.337
Why did I go to the office
and get entangled in this?

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.713
Just take it.

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.383
-Please take this.
-No.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.093
I told you already. I don't want it.

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:13.263
This was left for you by my father,
and it's your severance pay and salary.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:14.848
SAVINGS ACCOUNT, GO MA-JIN

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.810
That's supposed to come to me
from the company fund.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.228
But this was

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.523
out of Mr. Kang's pocket.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:26.193
It feels so wrong. No.
I can't stand something like this.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:27.695
Okay. We're done here.

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:33.742
The two of you should

00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.286
keep it reasonable.

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:40.374
I'm glad I got a chance
to mess with Mr. Ha, though.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.753
But if anything draws out for too long,
it becomes ugly. I'm leaving.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.213
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.382
Take care.

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.259
Goodbye.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:56.932
We just have to wait now.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:57.933
Yes.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:00.686
Italy will realize it right away
as soon as they open it.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.271
They're missing 10% of the rolls.

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.524
They might even get mad,
thinking they got tricked.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:07.818
So,

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.237
do you think Mr. Pyo will make the deal?

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.864
We'll have to see

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.743
if he's a businessman
who's more concerned about immediate gains

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.619
or if causes are more important to him.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:24.460
What are you talking about?

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.170
We didn't get the refund?

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:27.713
Italy reached out

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.882
and said the quantity is different.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:31.008
The quantity?

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.596
-Didn't we send everything?
-We did.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.308
But it's different from the quantity
written on the contract

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.727
sent from Italy as evidence.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.104
Hey, Mr. Ha.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.939
You're so good at doing your job.

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:50.402
I checked the quantity,
but there was a mix-up with the unit.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:52.446
The units were different.

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:55.282
The contract specifies 50,000 m,
not 50,000 yds.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.326
So I calculated the difference
between the two,

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.703
and 50,000 yds in meters…

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:04.958
The quantity we sent was 45,720 m,
which leaves out 5,000 m.

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:06.794
And?

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:10.422
If we do not immediately return
all 50,000 m,

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:14.009
they will ship everything back to us.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.177
Ship everything back?

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:18.430
A second return? That's insane.

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:30.776
And then?

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:33.320
And then, sir?

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:35.155
Yes, sir.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.657
And then,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.995
we must pay the shipping fees and
logistics fees regarding this contract,

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:44.832
and we'll have to find
another client as soon as possible.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.305
Empty your mind

00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.475
and come up with a better idea.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.979
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:14.194
Mr. Pyo.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.364
Mr. Kang Tae-poong,
the CEO of Typhoon Trading, has called.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.741
Kang Tae-poong?

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:21.952
The CEO?

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.970
You devised an interesting scheme.

00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.891
You should've called
if you were in need of help.

00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.269
Hyun-jun and I aren't total strangers.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:49.771
What are you trying to say?

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.327
It's the remaining 10% of the fabric.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.078
The cost price is 11,240,000 won,

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:08.665
and one separate condition
is that you must pay up front in cash.

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.218
SALES AGREEMENT

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.969
Did you say 11,240,000 won?

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:22.930
No.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.973
That's our cost price.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.391
The asking price is…

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.603
Twice as much?

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.940
You two both have lost your minds.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.316
Then let's triple it.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.070
It'll be 33,720,000 won.

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:51.959
Do you really think I'll buy this?

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:55.545
Wouldn't it be better
if you sent the rest to get the refund

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.507
than to pay the logistics fee as a penalty
and end up with the stock?

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.758
That sounds much better.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:01.802
Otherwise,

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.139
you can lose money and keep your pride.

00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:07.557
That's cool too.

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.769
Stop talking bullshit and get lost.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:12.688
How dare you try to pull this on us?

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.606
Get Mr. Ha here.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.025
-Yes, sir.
-Dad, you're going to buy this?

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.443
Let's just go.

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.112
It doesn't cost much anyway.

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.572
I need to make at least another penny.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.825
That's what's important now.

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:26.702
Why are you doing this?

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.370
Let's destroy this punk.

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:30.038
Hey.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.167
Did you just laugh?

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:36.169
Is this funny to you?!

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.130
Why did you laugh?

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.258
-Do you feel like you won?
-No.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.304
It's amusing.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:47.514
Is that so?

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.143
Have your laugh.

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.814
-Wait, Dad.
-Move.

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.242
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:09.077
It's fun.

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:14.374
To be a trader.

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:35.312
What are you doing?

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.730
Let's go.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:40.734
We have to go.

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.445
SAPDARI LOGISTICS

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:48.784
EPISODE 4
THE WIND CANNOT STOP ME

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:54.331
Hey.

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.625
Look who it is.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:57.667
Hello, sir.

00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:59.336
WAREHOUSE FLOOR PLAN

00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:00.587
Did you bring money?

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:04.132
Please take this and this.

00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:12.474
I'll have a seat.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:21.483
Here.

00:23:26.446 --> 00:23:28.990
Why did you bring me
something I can't even eat?

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:35.914
Don't be picky with the buns.
Eat whatever you grab.

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:37.999
There's a certain flavor I like.

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.503
I like these filled with sweet red beans…

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.420
GIRIN STEAMED BUNS

00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:44.214
…and this must be it.

00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:45.298
Sweet red beans.

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:47.551
Good grief.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.512
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.931
You have the same appetite as your father.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.643
What's wrong?

00:23:56.726 --> 00:24:01.648
Did you think I'd run off
with your office deed?

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.444
Well…

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:10.949
I'm sorry for everything, sir.

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:18.874
Money wasn't something petty.

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:22.169
It was something so precious
that it could even make you feel

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.045
very petty.

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:30.093
On that day,

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:34.514
I was afraid I wouldn't be able
to do something that awful

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:36.683
if I saw your dad's face.

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:43.440
But at times, the CEO of a company
must take action to prove to his staff

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.484
that their CEO is willing

00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:51.489
to do anything and everything
to protect them.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:55.410
-Anything and everything.
-Except for crimes.

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.496
-Of course not. No crimes.
-Of course not.

00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:01.458
All right, then.

00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:04.044
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it, sir.

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.298
Thank you for the bun.

00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:10.800
Don't finish everything.
Leave some for me.

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.510
There's a lot in here.

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.721
I didn't buy that many.

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:21.728
Containers swarm to Pusan Port for export,
but import containers are at a standstill,

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:25.190
displaying a polarization
in recent research.

00:25:25.273 --> 00:25:28.401
On 15th of last month, Pusan Maritime
Affairs and Fisheries announced

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:31.529
the total export volume at Pusan Port
at the end of November

00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.408
went up by 12.8%
compared to the previous month,

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.619
recording two digits
in the rate of increase.

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:42.207
However, the total import volume dropped
by 2.2%, displaying a great contrast.

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.877
I was listening.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.171
You shouldn't listen to the radio
during working hours.

00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:51.174
So, how much money do we have left?

00:25:51.758 --> 00:25:53.301
About 7,000,000 won.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:55.303
But it'll be gone by next month.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.596
We have to pay rent too.

00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:00.392
How's it working out?

00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:02.060
I should've demanded four times more.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.104
What is this?

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:06.314
Our New Year's cards look too messy.

00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:08.733
Christmas seals are the holiday spirit.

00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:13.530
TO MR. CHOI JUNG-HO

00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:16.449
-Is that your handwriting?
-Don't you recognize it?

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:19.411
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

00:26:21.663 --> 00:26:23.331
"It's the new year,
the Year of the Tiger."

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:27.210
"I wish you luck like a typhoon
to come your way in this coming year."

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.045
It's weird.

00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:31.506
How would you put it?

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.717
"Happy New Year.
Sincerely, Typhoon Trading."

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.346
You're way too cold-hearted.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:42.267
I'm going to the post office tomorrow,
so I'll send these then.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.102
Okay. But you know,

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:46.271
I want to visit this place in person.

00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:49.399
Hongshin Company?

00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:51.401
It's in Pusan.

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.736
Yes, Pusan,

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:57.699
where dollars and exports flock in.

00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:13.006
TICKETS ON WEEKDAYS CAN BE PURCHASED
ANYTIME VIA THE TRAIN CONDUCTOR

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:16.343
Gosh, it's my first time
coming to Pusan in ten years.

00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:17.969
It's my first time.

00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:20.597
Anyway, were you really invited?

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.890
Wasn't it just courtesy?

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.267
Yes, I was told to make sure I visit.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.146
It was said out of courtesy!

00:27:28.229 --> 00:27:30.523
-Gosh, what if we're a nuisance?
-We are?

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:32.400
It's just something people say.

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.110
-Come on.
-Mr. Kang Tae-poong?

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:37.113
Mr. Kang Tae-poong? Is that you?

00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:40.617
It's you, right?
I recognized you right away!

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.828
Hey, you look just like your dad!

00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:47.123
You look exactly the same,
with your fair complexion and long neck.

00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:49.292
-What a good-looking man.
-Thank you.

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:51.711
I'm Jung Cha-ran of Hongshin Company.

00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:55.131
I always ask people to visit,
but you're the first who actually came.

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.675
People of Pusan take promises seriously.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:00.512
So did you dress up a bit

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:02.514
-to travel all the way to Pusan?
-Of course.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:04.682
This isn't Pusan style.
What is this muffler?

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.267
-Lose it. It's too hot.
-I feel cold.

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:08.144
No, it's way too warm.

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:09.771
Your youth will keep you hot.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.314
-Right?
-It's really cold.

00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:12.273
Anyway…

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:14.692
Who are you?

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.529
Hello, my name is Oh Mi-seon.

00:28:17.612 --> 00:28:20.824
JINWON TRADING
CURTAINS, HANSEOP BAGS

00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:24.035
There are lots of things
to export from Pusan.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:25.412
Take a good look.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.331
My gosh.

00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.625
I love the energy here.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.460
Pusan is known for its energy,

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.671
and when it comes to energy,
you think of Pusan.

00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:37.966
What's the most popular
in Pusan right now?

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.300
The most popular thing in Pusan?

00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:41.553
Me.

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:44.764
Oh, my. I'm the most popular in Seoul!

00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:46.141
-Are you that guy?
-Yes.

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.684
That means

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:50.019
Kang Tae-poong rules Seoul,
while Cha-ran owns Pusan.

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:51.980
-Well, just Apgujeong.
-Apgujeong?

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.606
-Yes.
-Apgujeong?

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.899
-Hello, Ms. Jung.
-Hello.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.359
Hey, there.

00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.945
This glass noodle dish
is Pusan's delicacy.

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:01.156
-You have to try it.
-Can we export glass noodles?

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.866
-Glass noodles?
-Yes.

00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:06.411
I want to try making
glass noodles that are flat and wider.

00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:08.037
-Flat and wide?
-Yes.

00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:10.540
I've never had it flat and wide.

00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:13.168
-Would it taste good?
-I think it'll have a nice texture.

00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:15.837
Please be careful.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.630
Are you sending that to Shanghai?

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.800
It's the second floor here.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.262
This is fun.

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.308
This is amazing.

00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:29.684
I'll count these.

00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:36.316
INTERNATIONAL WIRE TRANSFER
MONEY EXCHANGE

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.067
This is exactly why

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.572
I could never
cut off the men of the Kang family.

00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:47.452
They may not be the most eloquent,
but they're modest in their actions.

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.661
Isn't that cute?

00:29:50.246 --> 00:29:51.706
My gosh.

00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:53.458
Look at the money.

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:57.295
Tae-poong.

00:29:57.378 --> 00:29:58.505
-Yes?
-So?

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:01.716
Tell me what you want to do
and what you want to eat.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.885
Well, it's not about what I want to eat.

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:06.638
I hear there are lots of dollars here.

00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:08.014
-Dollars?
-Yes.

00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:10.266
My goodness.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.810
This Gukje Market is a place

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:15.313
that survived the Korean War
and the wreck of the aftermath.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:19.150
You'll find any currency here
and everything you're looking for.

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:23.571
The real question is
who will get to them first.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.781
I see.

00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:26.491
-Let's go, Ms. Jung.
-I'm glad we came.

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.451
-It's already time?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.622
I have to exchange some money.

00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:35.500
Think about what you want to do.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.380
Excuse me. If you don't mind,
may I come along?

00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:42.048
I'm just curious.

00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:49.097
-Let's go.
-I will also take a tour outside.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.932
All right. Sure. Let's all leave.

00:30:51.432 --> 00:30:53.101
Goodness. The business is booming.

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.102
Stop it.

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.062
Have you ever seen Danish currency?

00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:57.689
I've never seen this before.

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:03.278
Have you ever seen me turn down money?

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.321
I'll even take currencies from the Moon.

00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:06.239
-Is that so?
-Goodbye.

00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:07.615
-Have a good one.
-Goodbye.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.869
Hey, wait. Just wait.

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.245
All right.

00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:13.663
Okay, thank you.

00:31:13.746 --> 00:31:15.790
This one. Please.

00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:21.254
I wonder if Tae-poong
is getting around all right.

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:22.422
He probably is.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.426
That was a rough one.

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.266
UJEONG SEAWEED
SAMIL VINYL

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:36.644
What the heck are you doing?
Will you be careful? You'll hurt yourself!

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.605
-You'll break everything.
-You okay?

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:39.689
I'm fine.

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:41.065
Goodness gracious.

00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.984
-Coming through.
-Hurry up.

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.819
Hey, grab this one first.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:47.322
-Where is it?
-This was for you.

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.324
-Be careful!
-You don't have to mind me.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:52.911
Don't fall over and lose it
like you did last time!

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:56.539
-Hold it tightly!
-All right!

00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:58.625
-Coming through!
-It's crowded here.

00:31:58.708 --> 00:31:59.959
Make way, please.

00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:02.128
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:07.300
Coming through. Please move.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.222
-You're here.
-Hey, there.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.557
How's business? Sold anything?

00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:15.975
Just one.

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.310
All right. Look.

00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:19.270
Crunch the numbers right
for three countries.

00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.022
How much is the yen today?

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.107
It was 1,150 won
without the decimal points.

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.820
Okay.

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:29.364
Yuans are 181 won.

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.157
What's with this?

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.367
Is it out of batteries?

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:34.535
Cha-ran is getting old too.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:38.498
It's been over a decade
since Cha-ran got old.

00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:40.833
It's 2,436,910 won.

00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:43.920
Wicked.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.546
Is that right?

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:52.679
You're not too bad.

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.306
Pay him out. Have a good one.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.474
-Okay. Bye.
-Goodbye.

00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:57.433
Bye.

00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:07.276
HYEONDAE TRADING
MYEONGSEONG TRADING

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:28.798
THE FUTURE OF MANAGEMENT

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:50.987
-Are you interested?
-Sorry?

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.697
Wait.

00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:57.577
I'm Park Yun-cheol, the CEO of Shoe Park.

00:33:58.494 --> 00:34:00.705
Read it backwards,
and it goes, Park's Shoe.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.374
SHOE PARK
CEO PARK YUN-CHEOL

00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:08.629
-You've done this for 30 years?
-Well, to be exact, it's been 32 years.

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:12.925
I took over the business
my father had started.

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:16.804
I am

00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.807
just like you, Mr. CEO.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:23.269
I find it uncomfortable
when people address me as the CEO.

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:25.021
I'm not a businessman.

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:27.565
I'm a researcher.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.862
"CEO Kang Tae-poong"?

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:38.910
-Are these safety shoes?
-Yes, that's right.

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:43.039
If you're interested,
would you like to see some samples?

00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:44.040
Look at this.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.875
Did you see that?

00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:49.420
It goes through with one strike.
Now, let's continue.

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:53.132
Stainless steel is a bit thicker
than that pot, isn't it?

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:55.426
But even this only takes a few strikes.

00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:58.137
-Like this.
-Oh, my gosh.

00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.391
See? Everything gets penetrated.

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.352
-All right.
-My gosh.

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:05.353
Don't be alarmed.

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.105
This frying pan is next.

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:08.356
What do you think will happen?

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.442
-I don't think it'll go through.
-You doubt it'll get penetrated?

00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:12.443
No.

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:14.946
Get through!

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.492
Take a look.

00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:21.369
Here's a regular safety shoe
out in the market.

00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:25.206
See? It rips through.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.374
And now, look at this.

00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:27.917
Shoe Park's Safe.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.336
Allow me to show you Shoe Park's product.

00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:32.380
I'll slam it down as hard as I can.

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.053
Like this.

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.891
See? It's unscathed.

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:45.560
Check for yourself.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.686
It's fine.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:49.272
These aren't just shoes. It's science.

00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.816
Yes, it took about three years to develop.

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.943
People can use these out on the field.

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.280
These will be useful.

00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:00.074
-These will save people from tetanus.
-Yes.

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.909
Yes, you're right about that.

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.912
In simple terms,

00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:09.167
these are the most comfortable
and safest safety shoes in the world.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.419
Shoe Park's Safe.

00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:13.963
What is it?

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.133
Why?

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:18.426
Hey!

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:20.887
Goodness gracious.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.598
-You're a reckless young man.
-How much are these?

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.433
I'm not a man after money.

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.976
Have you ever exported these?

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:33.232
May safety prevail
all over the world for people's good.

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.568
Shoe Park's Safe.

00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:39.906
Since you already have it on,
let me demonstrate one more thing for you.

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.657
Please don't worry.

00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:42.909
Don't be scared.

00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:44.243
-What? Me?
-Here we go.

00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:45.244
-On me?
-Yes.

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.246
Here's Shoe Park's Safe.

00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:52.919
How do you feel?

00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:54.921
You feel fine, don't you?

00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:56.005
Does it feel hot?

00:36:56.923 --> 00:36:58.216
Not at all!

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:00.635
My gosh.

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.803
Our factory is right around here.

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.555
Would you like a tour?

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:05.640
Yes.

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:07.391
-All right.
-Let's go.

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.851
It doesn't feel hot, right?

00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:10.353
I'm afraid it'll get hot soon.

00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:11.520
You don't think so?

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.027
Come on in.

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.821
These are our finished products.

00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:24.867
We keep them packaged
by different sizes, just like this.

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:31.624
These shoes are on amusement park rides.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.545
Mr. Park, you may not be greedy,
but you're ambitious.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.675
How many of these are there?

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:42.510
There aren't too many.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.804
About 7,000 pairs, so 14,000 shoes.

00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:47.306
You have 14,000 shoes?

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.100
Take a look at how these are made.

00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:50.268
This way, please.

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:52.645
Come with me.

00:37:55.564 --> 00:37:56.899
This is the area

00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:59.986
where the shoes are made and built.

00:38:00.903 --> 00:38:02.405
Take your time to look around.

00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:04.573
Keep up the good work.

00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:06.784
Let me show you something rad.

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:09.704
Take a look. This is…

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.539
Everything gets glued together,

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.332
and then it gets pressed together.

00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:16.460
-It's the four-way compression.
-Four-way compression.

00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:18.421
Isn't that rad?

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.881
Goodness gracious.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.050
I told you not to do this.

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.803
This is how tacky my staff are.

00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:27.430
THE BEST QUALITY!

00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:28.431
Goodness gracious.

00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:31.350
Don't do this from now on.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.269
You're embarrassing me.

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.062
Take a look at this.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.149
Look here. Right here.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:41.027
Everything is done by hand.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.530
It's a tough line of work,
so young people don't want to get in.

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:49.910
Up until about a decade ago,
people in Pusan made a living

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.662
by doing something like this.

00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:53.873
But then

00:38:53.956 --> 00:38:57.335
China began to bombard us
with unbelievably cheap labor.

00:38:58.627 --> 00:39:01.047
Factories that worked
as subcontractors for brands

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.840
all had to shut down in the end.

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.551
The domestic market isn't much.

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:07.678
But I wanted

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.389
to go all-in on this business
and try my luck.

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.892
I don't care much for money,

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.312
but I do have

00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:20.232
that relentless spirit in me.

00:39:28.741 --> 00:39:31.452
Why isn't Tae-poong here yet?

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.037
Has that grown man gotten lost?

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.580
I'm sorry.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.376
Ms. Oh!

00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:39.877
Ms. Oh! You have to see this.

00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:42.380
Hey, you.

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.256
-Guess what I got.
-What?

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.633
Pusan's famous fish cake?

00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:49.929
What's this?

00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:52.014
We're going to export this.

00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:53.724
His eyes are googly and gone.

00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:56.811
What's the big deal? What is it?

00:39:57.478 --> 00:39:59.271
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:03.943
-What is this place?
-Why?

00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.322
Here. Take this and cancel the agreement.

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:09.573
No, I can't do that.

00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:11.784
I got these at a dirt-cheap price
for paying up front--

00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:13.119
Kang Tae-poong!

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.250
Mr. Kang.

00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:29.927
Nam-mo!

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.554
-Hey, Mom. What's up?
-Hey.

00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:33.222
Two draft beers and one fried chicken.

00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:36.350
Why are you asking me for beer?
The machine is out there.

00:40:37.184 --> 00:40:38.894
You're right. I'm sorry.

00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:39.937
Pull yourself together!

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.106
All right. I'm sorry. Oh, no.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.485
My gosh!

00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:48.195
My goodness!

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:49.363
What's wrong? That's hot!

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.533
What's wrong, Nam-mo?

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.534
No, I'm fine.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.994
-Were you burnt?
-Table three.

00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.579
You got burnt. Put ice on it

00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:57.746
-or cold water.
-Okay.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:58.914
It's for table three.

00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:00.291
Goodness. It must hurt.

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:01.584
Gosh, what a mess.

00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:03.085
-Please enjoy.
-Excuse me.

00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:05.087
-We ordered first.
-Yes, you're right!

00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.339
I'm sorry. That tabled ordered first.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.466
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:10.551
-Please enjoy.
-Thanks.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.191
Thank you for participating
in the New Star Competition.

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.902
Number 32, Wang Nam-mo,

00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:30.070
you did not make the finals.

00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:36.285
Welcome to Momo's Pub. A table for two?

00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:38.162
-This way, please.
-Hello.

00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:39.371
Please have a seat.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.963
-Where are the adhesive bandages?
-For your hand? It's down there.

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:49.632
Under the sheet music. Yes.

00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:55.012
-Where are you going, Mom?
-I have an appointment.

00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:56.055
I'll make it quick.

00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:57.056
But it's store hours.

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.518
It's something good.
Let me off just for today.

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.812
-You're really leaving like that?
-Thanks!

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:07.900
What's this?

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:10.319
DENTORICH PLUS TOOTHPASTE

00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:11.362
Toothpaste?

00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:12.988
Have a drink.

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.043
Thank you.

00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.006
You might as well
throw it at me from there.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.841
Leave if you don't want it.

00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:37.555
Take a look, Ms. Oh.

00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:39.807
This is the sole for the safety shoes.

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:44.687
It's called an outsole,
and it's very sturdy and strong.

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.355
Well… One moment.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.233
Take a look.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.654
What was that sound?

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:54.863
Hey.

00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.323
I think you have customers.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.491
Go see them.

00:42:58.492 --> 00:42:59.827
Did you see that?

00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:02.705
I mean,

00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:05.332
the factory cost
for these shoes are 30,000 won,

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:08.168
but we're getting 500 pairs
for five million won.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.878
It's only 10,000 won per pair.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.674
Even at factory price,
we'll still earn threefold.

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:16.427
And fivefold if we sell it at 50,000 won.

00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:18.804
We'll definitely make money.

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.390
Why are these so cheap?

00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.309
Did you really see the products?

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.476
Yes, of course.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.437
I saw a huge pile of shoes
in the warehouse.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.565
The Grade Department Store here in Pusan

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:32.443
ordered 7,000 pairs
for their construction,

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.487
but they went bankrupt,
so they left the stock there.

00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:39.408
Yes, that damned department store
has put an end to many businesses here.

00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:42.870
But still, you can't just go
and sign the contract right away.

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:45.205
She's right. Why did you sign it so soon?

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:47.458
-Have you gone crazy?
-That's how I got these cheap.

00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.460
I would lose my chance
if I took time to think.

00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:51.795
This guy has some guts.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.465
A guy need guts like these
to run a business.

00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:57.009
The thing is,
the money he used isn't ours.

00:43:57.593 --> 00:43:59.678
We have to make payments, so why did you…

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:01.513
Yes, that was way over the line!

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:03.140
Yes, exactly.

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.685
I wanted to get started,
sell something, and make a profit.

00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:08.562
All right, man.

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.731
I don't know what's going on,

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.650
but if it already happened,

00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:14.360
don't try to patch it up.

00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:16.070
But you know,

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.905
just do your best to be a success.

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.449
-Yes, that's right.
-I know.

00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:21.950
Yes, you're right.

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:25.913
Have a drink and make amends.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.623
I'd like a cola, please.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.958
What's he saying? Hey!

00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.461
I need a spoon to pick my ears.

00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:34.797
I literally get drunk
even after one glass of soju.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.382
Stop talking nonsense.

00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:39.551
Hey, I ran over at once
because you asked me to come.

00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:41.595
How dare you not accept a drink, you punk?

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:42.930
Have a drink. You can't say no.

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:46.809
This can be dangerous.

00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:49.353
I'll cover for him.

00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:51.563
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.440
You must be quite a drinker.

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:56.527
Well, I know how to keep up at a party.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.195
That sounds awesome.

00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:02.533
But you know,
it's not a lot of fun if it's just us two.

00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:04.660
Do you remember those boys?

00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:06.453
I know one of them.

00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:08.539
He said you were pretty.

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:11.583
-He only had his eyes on you.
-Really?

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.920
Wait. Just one moment.

00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:18.132
Are you here to hang out?

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.438
What's so solid about those guys,

00:45:33.147 --> 00:45:34.022
and how is she pretty?

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:39.361
Good grief.
He's making sure this is his turf.

00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:40.779
All right, kiddo.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.657
Hey, about Shoe Park.

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.952
I know everything
that goes on around here.

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.163
Why does it sound so unfamiliar?

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.623
It sounds new to me.

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.295
Tae-poong.

00:45:56.378 --> 00:45:58.338
Hey, what's wrong with him?

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.548
My goodness.

00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:01.467
He really can't handle alcohol?

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.470
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:07.097
You surprised me.

00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:43.467
Why? What's wrong?

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.678
-One second.
-What is it?

00:47:14.748 --> 00:47:15.707
Here.

00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:17.626
Look here, Ms. Oh.

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:20.420
I WON'T MAKE YOU MAD

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.672
Look.

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:25.509
What I want to say to you
is written right here.

00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:34.351
I won't…

00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:37.354
From now on,

00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:41.191
-I won't make you mad.
-Jeez.

00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:46.280
I promise I won't make you mad, Ms. Oh.

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.490
I WON'T

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:51.451
It says "I won't."

00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:56.832
I won't do it again.

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.460
Are you going to do this every time?

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.465
Then let me tell you my wish.

00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:08.552
Or should I save it?

00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:10.178
What do you mean?

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:13.890
I drank on your behalf back there.

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.561
You didn't drink for me!

00:48:17.644 --> 00:48:20.272
-You told me not to drink.
-Whatever.

00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:22.107
Just do those things only with me.

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:28.780
I have to write down my wish.

00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:31.700
-Do you have paper?
-No.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.662
Give me your hand.

00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:40.751
Come on, give it to me.

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:43.670
All right.

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.006
My

00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:47.799
wish

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.469
coupon.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.515
I'm saving it.

00:48:58.477 --> 00:49:01.146
I'll make sure I use this someday.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.731
Got it?

00:49:12.407 --> 00:49:13.617
I think

00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:16.036
we should walk a little now.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:21.875
Jeez.

00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:30.967
Careful.

00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.354
Do you feel confident?

00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:44.856
I'll have to try.

00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:48.235
Those 500 pairs of 10,000-won shoes?

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.071
-I'm sure I can sell those.
-No, not that.

00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:52.989
Can you be a real CEO…

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:56.618
for our business?

00:49:58.328 --> 00:49:59.454
Let's see…

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.710
I don't think

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.796
I know what it means to be a CEO yet.

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.132
But I will

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:14.261
do anything and everything
for the company.

00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:24.271
I know I feel confident

00:50:24.771 --> 00:50:25.939
to be a trader.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.710
Ms. Oh, you are…

00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:51.715
like a cosmos.

00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:06.813
-It's cold.
-Jeez.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.190
My gosh.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.358
My feet are all wet.

00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:11.943
That's not a big deal.

00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:14.529
-Your feet are barely wet.
-No, they're drenched.

00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.239
-Come on.
-Where are you going?

00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:18.366
-Stop it!
-Those are the good days.

00:51:19.284 --> 00:51:22.370
They looked miserable earlier,
but they're running like puppies now.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.582
That's why they're still in their youth.

00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:31.755
Get back here.

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:35.217
I know I can sell all those shoes!

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:38.178
Come back here! Come!

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:39.346
Step back, will you?

00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:31.231
SALVATION ARMY DONATION KETTLE

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:32.440
It's so weird.

00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:36.570
I don't go to church,
but I feel great during Christmas season.

00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.363
Carols sound merry…

00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:40.282
-Hello.
-…and the cakes taste delicious too.

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:44.202
I even feel like doing a good deed
every now and then.

00:52:45.036 --> 00:52:45.912
Have a good one.

00:52:47.622 --> 00:52:50.333
It feels like I'll see a present
next to me when I wake up.

00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:52.168
How can I put this?

00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:56.464
It feels like a miracle will happen.

00:53:01.469 --> 00:53:02.596
NOTICE OF EVICTION

00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:08.476
Why is the door open?

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:09.895
Mom?

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.607
-Tae-poong.
-Mom?

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.901
-Are you Mr. Kang Tae-poong?
-Yes.

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.110
Have you received the mail?

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:18.862
What mail?

00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:22.157
I'm sorry.

00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:23.825
REMINDER - OVERDUE

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:25.744
Your apartment unit
has been auctioned off.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:28.538
We will now confiscate
your tangible properties.

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.499
You may take necessities
to sustain your life.

00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:34.252
I'll give you 30 minutes.

00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:36.713
We're behind at work too.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.966
This is the house.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.010
-Come quickly. Grab what you can.
-Goodness!

00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:44.429
-Let's hurry.
-My gosh.

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.389
-Mom.
-Move!

00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:48.266
-You need to stop!
-I don't care.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.727
-This is obstruction of official duties!
-Darn it!

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.604
What do you think you're all doing?

00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:54.856
-Take this.
-Stop it. Mister!

00:53:55.607 --> 00:53:56.775
What's with you?

00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:00.362
-Pack your stuff.
-What?

00:54:00.946 --> 00:54:02.280
Sir, don't do this.

00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:04.407
Ma'am! Come on.

00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:32.852
I already know there is no Santa Claus.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.606
Let me get it.

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.619
One second.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.329
Wait.

00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:00.880
My goodness.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:04.050
Tae-poong, have we been
thrown out into the streets?

00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.178
Are you okay, Mom?

00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:10.473
Why didn't you put on something warmer?

00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:14.060
They didn't let me take anything
that was worth money.

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:18.732
-What time is it?
-What?

00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:24.654
-Why? What is it?
-Stay here for a moment.

00:55:25.238 --> 00:55:26.740
-Where are you going?
-Stay there.

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.533
Wait, where are you going?

00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:29.784
No, not the back gates.

00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:33.788
-I'll be right back.
-Don't run.

00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:54.309
Mom.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:59.773
-This could've turned out really bad.
-Why?

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:04.611
I think I was really clever
when I said I'd pick this up later.

00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:10.283
This was your dad's last present.

00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:21.169
-Button up.
-Okay.

00:56:23.838 --> 00:56:26.007
-Let's go before anyone sees us.
-Let's go.

00:56:28.259 --> 00:56:29.427
-I'll take both.
-No.

00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:30.970
-I'll take these.
-Let me have one.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.388
-I got these.
-Goodness.

00:56:32.472 --> 00:56:33.515
-Let's go.
-My gosh.

00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:43.733
Yes. Bye.

00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:46.361
Okay, take care.

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:48.655
Bye.

00:56:56.871 --> 00:56:58.581
How can people be so cold?

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.793
I can't believe
no one is willing to take us in.

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:07.966
Tae-poong, where do we go from here?

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.593
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:13.388
Let's go and stay…

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.599
with Dad tonight.

00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.854
What are you talking about?

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:24.858
We have to stay strong
and think about a way to rise above this!

00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:29.154
How can you say
something like that to your mother?

00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:31.698
What's wrong with you?!

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:36.953
You're awful!

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:48.756
I already feel cold and hungry.

00:57:50.675 --> 00:57:52.177
Why are you adding to this?

00:57:54.179 --> 00:57:56.806
What is wrong with you?

00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:03.021
TYPHOON TRADING

00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:08.026
TYPHOON TRADING

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.745
This is where Dad is.

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.222
YEOPJIP RAMYEON

00:58:48.149 --> 00:58:50.026
It's cooked perfectly right now.

00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:55.615
All right.

00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:57.242
Enjoy your food.

00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:00.036
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:13.841
You're really good at making cup ramyeon.

00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:18.179
I make even better coffee
in a 3-2-2 combo.

00:59:18.263 --> 00:59:19.514
I'll make you a cup after this.

00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.726
You really sound like an office worker.

00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:30.149
I'm so glad I raised you into a man
who can do just about anything.

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:32.110
You know what?

00:59:34.153 --> 00:59:35.697
Do you think I took after you?

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.031
Of course.

00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:41.119
Your features and skin complexion
all resemble me.

00:59:42.453 --> 00:59:44.831
-You think so?
-Anyway, this is odd.

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:48.626
I had zero appetite earlier,
but this is so easy to eat.

00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.503
Why is this so good?

00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:53.381
-It's warm, isn't it?
-Yes, it's good.

00:59:54.966 --> 00:59:57.385
But without a day like Christmas,

00:59:58.052 --> 01:00:00.847
this winter would be too long.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.766
It'd be too cold.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.901
There's a draft in this office.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.111
Are you cold?

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:18.114
You'll get facial paralysis
if you sleep in the cold.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.869
-Have you watched Tears of the Dragon?
-Of course, I have.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:26.372
Tae-poong.

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:31.711
Everything feels like a nightmare to me.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:36.007
It'll be so nice if I wake up

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:39.427
back at our place
after a good night's sleep.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.100
Goodness.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:55.485
Well, as long as we're together,
that's where our home is.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.071
Look.

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:00.782
Oh, my.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.995
I bought this with my hard-earned money.

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:08.331
Isn't it pretty?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.671
It is.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.557
This is kind of embarrassing,

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.436
but before,

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:35.525
when I saw people who did
hard labor out in the street,

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.986
I used to feel bad for them.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.909
So I always thought
I was a really kind-hearted guy.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.622
You are kind-hearted.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.425
I realized people who sweat and work hard

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:06.472
weren't pitiful nor great.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.728
That's just how you make money.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:19.420
So, Dad,

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.924
Merry Christmas.

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:35.603
Time to go to bed.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.805
So?

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.225
-Are you keeping an eye on Kang Tae-poong?
-Yes, sir.

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.227
I confirmed that
he moved out of his house.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.104
Is that so?

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.315
CONTRACTOR: PYO MERCHANT MARINE

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:27.530
I wonder what it feels like
to lose everything one after another

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.241
at such a young age.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:11.324
THE WIND CANNOT STOP ME

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.652
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:48.694
Hello.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.697
My name is Oh Beom,
number 47 in first grade.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.783
-Cue!
-All right. Cue!

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:57.662
I already showed it to over ten places,
and some of them showed interest.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.914
Are you nervous? I'm not nervous at all.

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:01.207
All done.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.250
I'm so sorry.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.919
Did you borrow money from thugs?

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:06.671
What about my money? Where's my money?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.256
That money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.717
-Is this fun to you?
-Yes. It's a lot of fun.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.760
Don't try too hard.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:15.638
You can lean on me
when things become too tough.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:17.348
-The products are coming from Pusan?
-Hello.

01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:19.016
I need to take interest.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.643
I suppose you're scared now.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.565
