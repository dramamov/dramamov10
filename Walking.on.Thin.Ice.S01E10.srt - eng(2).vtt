WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
DRUG USE ISNâ€™T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:56.999
Are you really going to quit
after this job?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.375
Let's be honest. This pays better
than your new job.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.834
Shouldn't we do this a bit longer?

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:10.000
Do you want to do this forever?

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:11.999
Of course not.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.999
We can quit after
we've earned enough.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.375
How much is enough?
One billion? Two billion?

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:25.136
There are always consequences.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.000
55, HAENGBOK-RO 32-GIL

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.252
Mr. Hwang Junhyun.

00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:49.346
Do you know where you are?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.417
Mr. Hwang Junhyun?

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:59.487
It seems like he has aphasia.

00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:03.411
Let's move him
to a general ward and observe.

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.999
Contact his guardian.
We need a brain CT.

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.375
Understood.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.667
Mr. Hwang, it's time to...

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:29.000
Where did he go?

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.351
Mr. Hwang?

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:35.584
Mr. Hwang!

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.375
Mr. Hwang Junhyun!

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.834
EPISODE 10

00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:31.863
That's the last of
the hospital footage.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.999
He can barely walk
and has post-shock symptoms.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.459
Where could he have gone?

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.083
The first place he'd want to go.

00:03:41.148 --> 00:03:43.504
They were very close,
unlike other dealers.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.999
I was worried he'd want
revenge for his brother.

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:51.751
But he fell into a coma.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.999
TIME AND LOCATION OF INCIDENT

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.375
Could he be targeting Kang Eunsoo?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.542
PARTNER

00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:33.876
The phone you have dialed
is switched off.

00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:36.000
Leave a message after the beep.

00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.687
I'll tell you everything.

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.626
I'm in front of your house.
I'll wait until you come out.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.751
Stop right there.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.542
Who are you?

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:50.042
...better off cleaning
at the club.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.334
But a housemaid for Sua's tutor?

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:56.250
Yeoju told me you work
as a housekeeper for Sua's art tutor.

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:57.751
Is that true?

00:05:59.537 --> 00:06:00.745
The art tutor?

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.402
It was you!

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:06.334
Mom

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.042
SUA

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.707
You have two phones?
Hand them over.

00:08:39.766 --> 00:08:41.139
This isn't 9 kg.

00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:43.638
I'll give you the rest
when you finish paying.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.542
I don't just carry
two billion won in cash, okay?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.292
What has the media done to people?

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:56.999
- I guess no deal.
- Hold your horses.

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:21.000
You're impatient
just like your partner.

00:09:25.302 --> 00:09:28.083
Wait, I meant your ex-partner.

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:36.500
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.409
Leave a message after the beep.

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:40.999
MOM

00:10:26.628 --> 00:10:29.295
You're an amateur.
I thought you were a pro.

00:10:30.476 --> 00:10:31.933
First time seeing two billion?

00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:45.389
I have a condition of my own.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.736
I want information on James.

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:52.971
His real name, who he is,

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:55.573
and why he approached me.

00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:59.123
I don't like losing on deals.

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:00.693
Tell me all of that,

00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:03.857
and I'll spare your life
and give you the money.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:20.709
Nothing hard about that.

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:23.542
Fine.

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:27.626
Let me explain.
I'll tell you what I had in mind.

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.417
I'll tell you about James.

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:40.667
Hear me out.

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:44.209
It felt weird.

00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:46.940
I know Eunsoo.

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:49.190
My Eunsoo isn't that kind of person.

00:11:49.528 --> 00:11:53.161
It was you.
You made her that way!

00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:59.959
Listen to me!

00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.193
Your medical bills.
The debt you racked up!

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:05.459
Do you really not know?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.795
You're the one who made her do it!

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.181
Eunsoo's goal isn't to get rich.

00:12:10.353 --> 00:12:15.667
Your wife was going to quit after
paying your bills and debt, got it?

00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:19.959
So calm the fuck down
and hand it over.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.999
Then nothing will happen
to your family from now on.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.697
You're going to sell that.
I'll call the police.

00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:49.689
Will you send Eunsoo to jail?

00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:52.375
SUA

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:54.751
Dad, save me.

00:12:54.792 --> 00:13:00.542
Some creep kidnapped me
and locked me up!

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:03.077
Sua.

00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:08.999
Dad! Save me, please!
Dad, I'm scared!

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Help me!

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:15.626
Sua...

00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:20.209
Dad, are you okay?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.334
What's wrong?

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.459
Please help.

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:22.710
Eunyoung, Eunyoung!

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.257
Wake up, Eunyoung!

00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:45.334
Please spare me.
Please...

00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:47.999
Please let me go.

00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:39.834
Get up! Run!

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:23.375
Mr. Lee?

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:25.733
Sua, are you alright?

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.167
What?

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:30.667
We met at Medusa,
and his codename is James.

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:32.812
That's pretty much all I know.

00:16:37.624 --> 00:16:41.417
I'd love to bluff my way out,

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:43.417
but I don't do cons.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:48.542
I didn't bring the agreed amount,

00:16:48.584 --> 00:16:51.375
so I'll just take payment for these.

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:56.542
Are you fucking with me?

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:04.709
Let go! Are you going to kill me?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:13.209
I'm just trying to do
the trade we agreed upon, okay?

00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:22.792
If you're not going to bury me now,
let the fuck go of me.

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:23.999
Driver, did you leave the dashcam on?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.458
Yes, just like you said.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.626
But nothing happened.

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:30.792
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Ah, yes.

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:52.083
MISSED CALL - SUA

00:18:57.999 --> 00:18:59.209
Mom, help me.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.167
Sua.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:10.999
Sua! Get out of here.

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:12.250
Hurry!

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:54.292
Right side.

00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:56.125
His right rib.

00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:29.792
That guy's broken rib...

00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:32.999
...hasn't healed yet.

00:22:59.362 --> 00:23:00.695
Sua!

00:23:04.226 --> 00:23:06.560
Sua, what happened?

00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:09.999
What happened to your hand?

00:23:22.118 --> 00:23:23.126
Why are you here?

00:23:26.102 --> 00:23:28.143
- Hey, Taeho.
- Yes.

00:23:28.184 --> 00:23:29.959
Did you check his ID?

00:23:30.226 --> 00:23:33.143
Yes, the incident report...
One moment.

00:23:34.834 --> 00:23:36.334
- Is that it?
- Yes, it is.

00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:38.999
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:45.500
Hey! Hey! What the hell?

00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:48.042
Knock it off!

00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:49.834
Take him to the interview room.

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:06.250
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

00:24:08.042 --> 00:24:09.459
Let me see.

00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:12.209
Do you know him, ma'am?

00:25:02.242 --> 00:25:06.618
TWO HOURS AGO

00:25:17.334 --> 00:25:20.042
I forgot the coma guy
was a factor.

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:50.125
Slipped my mind.
I have to give it to you.

00:25:50.167 --> 00:25:52.209
You're a damn persistent person.

00:25:52.876 --> 00:25:54.918
You taught it to me.

00:25:56.792 --> 00:25:59.999
That persistence always prevails.

00:26:00.334 --> 00:26:01.999
You told me yourself.

00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:03.406
But why?

00:26:06.918 --> 00:26:08.542
Why did you become like that?

00:26:20.918 --> 00:26:22.542
For a better life.

00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:28.792
And that's not for everyone.
Not in this damn world.

00:26:28.999 --> 00:26:32.375
That's the reason.
So stop digging.

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:36.792
If you keep this up,
I might have to dig into your family.

00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:38.999
You lost your baby in the womb.

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:42.078
Don't lose the other one too.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.282
Alright, Gyeongdo?

00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.250
Must've been terrified.

00:27:12.855 --> 00:27:14.312
Any serious injuries?

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:17.127
No.

00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:21.019
You're the art tutor of the girl?

00:27:21.584 --> 00:27:22.276
Yes.

00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:25.999
Have you seen the culprit before?

00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:29.792
So you don't know
why he attacked you?

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.167
How did you know she was there?

00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:36.791
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:27:36.937 --> 00:27:38.355
How did you know she was there?

00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:14.999
This is 55, Haengbok-ro 32-gil.
Someone collapsed here.

00:28:15.156 --> 00:28:17.926
It's an emergency patient.
Please hurry.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.083
LIVE LOCATION SENT BY SUA.

00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:35.000
I left the car to walk because of
the snow, and I heard a scream.

00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:41.083
- Where do you live?
- Cheongdae-dong.

00:28:41.709 --> 00:28:42.576
Cheongdae-dong...

00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:46.209
The man attacked and kidnapped you.

00:28:46.335 --> 00:28:49.888
What were you doing
before you got kidnapped?

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.125
Answer me.

00:28:57.999 --> 00:28:59.709
What are you doing?

00:28:59.751 --> 00:29:02.083
My daughter is the victim.

00:29:09.626 --> 00:29:11.417
It came out of your daughter's bag.

00:29:13.584 --> 00:29:14.999
CRIME-SCENE EVIDENCE

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:20.016
The suspect melted the drug in this pouch
and tried to inject it into your daughter.

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:25.334
Did you know
what was inside the jelly bag?

00:29:26.792 --> 00:29:27.959
No.

00:29:28.042 --> 00:29:29.999
Then why did you have it?

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:33.176
Why were you delivering it
here and there?

00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:40.108
To get paid.

00:29:41.709 --> 00:29:42.687
By who?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.550
Who ordered you to do this for money?

00:29:51.794 --> 00:29:54.104
URGENT: HIRING A DROPPER. DM ME.

00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.667
I really don't know.

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:10.280
It's from a post on an app.

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:14.375
If you DM that you'll do it,
they send the place.

00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:18.334
You don't understand what you've done.

00:30:18.709 --> 00:30:20.209
It's drug distribution.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.250
Do you know how serious that crime is?

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:27.500
I...

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:31.999
I didn't know...

00:30:33.834 --> 00:30:39.459
Detective, wait.
Can we talk in private?

00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:43.334
- Detective Kim.
- Yes.

00:30:44.751 --> 00:30:46.231
Escort them to the interview room.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.918
This way, please.

00:31:03.876 --> 00:31:05.083
Wait.

00:31:10.967 --> 00:31:12.402
You can go.

00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:16.808
- Sir.
- Yes?

00:31:16.855 --> 00:31:20.667
We're done. You may leave.
We'll call if we need you.

00:31:21.584 --> 00:31:22.542
Okay.

00:31:36.287 --> 00:31:39.709
If you don't want to get screwed too,
make your stance clear.

00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:44.709
Alright, James?

00:32:46.709 --> 00:32:47.792
What a pity.

00:32:48.209 --> 00:32:51.375
My daughter would never.
You set her up.

00:32:51.913 --> 00:32:54.108
You don't know your own kid.

00:32:55.125 --> 00:32:58.876
Did you make someone
trail my daughter?

00:32:58.918 --> 00:33:02.375
I always make sure I have insurance.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.918
I was truly shocked.

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:16.648
A mother who makes
her daughter sell drugs...

00:33:20.086 --> 00:33:23.083
No, it wasn't me.

00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:27.667
- I was really going to quit.
- Me too.

00:33:29.709 --> 00:33:31.292
I was also going to quit.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.451
Just one more time.

00:33:33.842 --> 00:33:36.999
Just one last time
and then quit.

00:33:38.138 --> 00:33:39.097
That's how it goes.

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:47.167
Didn't you say
we're not so different?

00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:52.544
He said there's an easier way
to make big money.

00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:54.607
My family doesn't know it.

00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:57.626
Frankly, I felt it too.

00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:04.446
That maybe you and I
are not so different.

00:34:04.852 --> 00:34:08.500
You're trying to bite something down
and push through it.

00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:12.209
Just like my old self.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.876
But unfortunately...

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:19.042
It will inevitably...

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:23.721
...end up exploding.

00:34:26.292 --> 00:34:27.709
At least from what I went through.

00:34:28.417 --> 00:34:30.042
You'll really do anything?

00:34:30.709 --> 00:34:35.725
Then hand everything over.
The whole stolen bag.

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:53.999
I will kill anyone...

00:34:57.247 --> 00:34:58.125
Come on, Jinhee.

00:34:58.167 --> 00:35:02.167
...who touches
my daughter or my family.

00:35:02.918 --> 00:35:04.626
You shouldn't leave like this.

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:07.825
Anyone who looks down on me,
I will kill.

00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:11.834
Apologize!

00:35:11.999 --> 00:35:17.667
I don't want anyone
to ever dare ignore me again.

00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:25.500
Apologize! Apologize!

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.500
Apologize!

00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:30.125
Apologize!

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.375
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:43.918
Were you really going to quit?

00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:49.125
This is the dining room.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:53.918
You can separate the space
from the kitchen.

00:35:53.959 --> 00:35:55.459
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

00:35:57.042 --> 00:35:58.000
I like it.

00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:05.459
Then, shall we keep going?

00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:07.417
Sure.

00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:11.500
I'll do it with you.

00:36:23.302 --> 00:36:24.261
Hey, Gyeongdo.

00:36:28.247 --> 00:36:30.247
Will you be okay?

00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:35.595
- Sir.
- Yeah.

00:36:35.918 --> 00:36:38.090
Did Inspector Jang
ever lend you money?

00:36:39.918 --> 00:36:43.042
Yeah, a few times
when I was suspended.

00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:46.184
I tried to repay him,
but he wouldn't take it.

00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:47.685
Why do you ask?

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.918
Be careful.
Don't end up like me.

00:36:57.125 --> 00:36:58.125
Hey, Gyeongdo...

00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:38.215
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:41.808
Your daughter will go to juvie.

00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:46.918
And your husband will end up dying
after getting cheap chemo again.

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:51.167
Because I'm going to report you
to the tax office.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.380
You'll never touch the money you earned,
and lose your house.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:04.060
Maybe you'll take your daughter
and leave this place for somewhere else.

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:06.292
Yeah, you'll probably run.

00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:09.751
But I'll keep finding you.

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:12.334
I'll find you no matter what.

00:38:13.083 --> 00:38:16.848
And when I do,
everything you love

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.432
and everything you wish to protect

00:38:23.304 --> 00:38:25.388
will all be smashed by me.

00:38:28.584 --> 00:38:29.542
Trust me.

00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:32.729
I will.

00:38:34.497 --> 00:38:36.351
I really will.

00:38:38.876 --> 00:38:39.999
I'll destroy you.

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:53.918
What do you want from me?

00:39:20.999 --> 00:39:21.999
Hey.

00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:29.999
SERGEANT CHOI GYEONGDO

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.999
Call me if you need me.

00:39:32.999 --> 00:39:37.500
If you want to talk
or need my help.

00:39:38.821 --> 00:39:40.737
I don't think this is over yet.

00:39:46.876 --> 00:39:47.999
Wait.

00:39:56.073 --> 00:39:57.000
Taxi.

00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:14.999
Why is there no free taxi?

00:40:15.405 --> 00:40:16.739
Gosh...

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.250
I didn't know.

00:40:22.312 --> 00:40:24.562
I thought it was strange,

00:40:25.865 --> 00:40:28.295
but I didn't know
it was drugs, honestly.

00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:32.209
I just... needed the money.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.134
Money for what?

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:35.798
Tuition.

00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:41.584
To go to an arts high school.
I wanted to save up for it.

00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:45.792
I know you're struggling
with Dad's medical bills.

00:40:47.108 --> 00:40:48.735
That's why I...

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:57.500
Mom, what will happen to me?

00:40:58.918 --> 00:41:03.709
Am I going to juvie?
What do I do now?

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:05.145
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:41:05.175 --> 00:41:07.216
No, you're going nowhere.

00:41:07.742 --> 00:41:09.283
I won't let that happen.

00:41:10.813 --> 00:41:13.271
Trust me. Don't worry.

00:41:13.626 --> 00:41:15.876
Mom, I'm really sorry.

00:41:17.459 --> 00:41:19.250
Mom, I'm really, really sorry.

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:22.042
I didn't know it would end up like this.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:04.627
I asked the patient to tell you,
but I guess you didn't hear.

00:42:04.658 --> 00:42:07.083
The numbers have risen back
to the previous level.

00:42:07.541 --> 00:42:09.709
Also, an infection has developed.

00:42:09.751 --> 00:42:13.170
Given his immunodeficient state,
he went into septic shock.

00:42:13.876 --> 00:42:16.250
We'll start antibiotics.

00:42:16.292 --> 00:42:21.000
But even if he regains consciousness,
the cancer itself may not improve.

00:42:24.918 --> 00:42:29.292
What should we do?
Is there a way?

00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:35.999
Recent studies showed that carbon-ion
therapy can help with pancreatic cancer.

00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:38.904
But it's not available in our country yet.

00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:48.323
Given Mr. Park's condition,
flying abroad could be fatal too.

00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:50.959
I saw your strap was worn out.

00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:58.209
Well done, Eunsoo.
You're good at everything you do.

00:44:27.768 --> 00:44:31.810
If that bag hadn't ended up
in my house,

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:37.417
or if I had just reported it back then...

00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:42.792
Then your husband
wouldn't have gotten treated.

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:47.417
Even if you could go back,

00:44:47.999 --> 00:44:49.959
can you really say
you'd choose differently?

00:44:54.999 --> 00:44:56.667
I definitely can't.

00:45:00.667 --> 00:45:01.792
I'm sorry.

00:45:03.709 --> 00:45:07.219
I was the one who yelled at you
to share everything,

00:45:08.711 --> 00:45:10.878
but I didn't do so myself.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.792
No one listened to me,
no matter what I said.

00:45:18.606 --> 00:45:23.189
At one point, I became someone
who never showed my inner self.

00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:28.709
Even now, I don't know where
or how to start.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.667
But I'll tell you,

00:46:42.292 --> 00:46:43.709
Are you leaving?

00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:44.847
Taking off?

00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:46.751
Where's the newbie?

00:46:46.792 --> 00:46:49.131
She got discharged.
I told her to rest tomorrow.

00:46:49.542 --> 00:46:51.999
Well done. Keep it up.

00:46:51.999 --> 00:46:53.999
- Yes, sir.
- Good night.

00:47:05.495 --> 00:47:06.912
See you tomorrow.

00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:20.999
Be careful.
Don't end up like me.

00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:31.532
I thought I could fix
everything afterward.

00:47:32.181 --> 00:47:36.292
Blinded by revenge,
I put you aside for a bit.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.918
I guess I wasn't any different.

00:47:50.838 --> 00:47:51.867
Thanks.

00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:56.209
For protecting my family.

00:48:03.626 --> 00:48:08.584
This is the key to a private safe
with the drug from the headrest.

00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:10.999
You hold onto it.

00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:23.375
From now on,
we must trust each other to the end.

00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:41.999
Jang Taegu killed Hwang Donghyun.

00:48:44.667 --> 00:48:48.667
He won't stop
even after locking up Sua.

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:55.109
If he gets suspected,
he'll pin it on either me or you.

00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:58.581
We can't let him
drag us around forever.

00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.250
What do we do?

00:49:01.999 --> 00:49:04.542
We get rid of Jang Taegu.

00:49:06.132 --> 00:49:09.761
Let's erase him for good.

00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:21.149
I found a contact in China
through our foreign exchange guy.

00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:23.584
Don't worry.
It won't be a problem.

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:33.125
For the right money, they'll smuggle
people and goods in and out.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.250
And even...

00:49:38.792 --> 00:49:39.999
...kill people?

00:49:51.999 --> 00:49:55.709
If you lure Jang Taegu out,

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:58.248
they'll handle the rest.

00:50:29.106 --> 00:50:30.440
And then...

00:50:32.167 --> 00:50:33.876
He'll be gone forever.

00:50:36.042 --> 00:50:37.334
Forever?

00:50:37.542 --> 00:50:40.083
Yes, forever.

00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:09.966
Are we stuck here again?

00:51:09.997 --> 00:51:11.999
Orders are to be on standby.

00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:14.999
The doctor said I shouldn't stay
in one place for too long.

00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:17.999
Let's go eat something.

00:51:18.792 --> 00:51:19.999
Yeah, let's go.

00:52:23.744 --> 00:52:25.076
Honey?

00:52:25.736 --> 00:52:26.694
Where are you going?

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.670
Did you come here barefoot?

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:51.209
Honey.

00:52:53.364 --> 00:52:55.322
I didn't want to believe that tutor.

00:52:56.292 --> 00:53:00.999
I thought he forced you into it.

00:53:01.753 --> 00:53:06.331
No, that's not it.
Let me explain.

00:53:06.472 --> 00:53:09.500
Still hadn't enough?
Is that why you keep doing it?

00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:14.834
No matter how difficult,
some lines are not to be crossed!

00:53:15.475 --> 00:53:19.042
Do you know how
you ruined Jinhee's family?

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:23.167
Do you not care if people die?

00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:24.834
Is that who you are?

00:53:24.876 --> 00:53:28.292
What about you?
Don't you care if our family dies?

00:53:29.407 --> 00:53:30.500
What?

00:53:30.542 --> 00:53:32.417
As long as others are fine,

00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:36.626
is it okay for me
and Sua to die?

00:53:36.667 --> 00:53:38.667
I'm not saying that!

00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:43.829
Our family is broke because
you gave everything to others.

00:53:44.235 --> 00:53:46.438
I tried to make it
up by working in

00:53:46.477 --> 00:53:49.000
restaurants and doing
deliveries for 15 years!

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.792
The one who sacrificed
for our family wasn't you.

00:53:53.834 --> 00:53:56.250
It was me, okay?

00:53:57.792 --> 00:54:01.876
How could you judge me?

00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:04.375
Seriously!

00:54:07.373 --> 00:54:10.042
You, of all people,
shouldn't say that!

00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:14.193
You're the reason I started this!

00:54:21.999 --> 00:54:25.228
Yeah, it's all because of me.

00:54:27.876 --> 00:54:32.796
The tutor also told me,
and I didn't want to believe it.

00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:37.209
Honey, listen...

00:54:44.375 --> 00:54:46.792
CALLER ID BLOCKED

00:54:50.284 --> 00:54:57.451
Once this is over,
things will return to how it was.

00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:00.061
Just wait a little.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.999
If you can't stop,

00:55:26.382 --> 00:55:27.671
then I'll make you stop.

00:55:28.055 --> 00:55:29.472
It's the least I can do.

00:55:35.292 --> 00:55:36.209
No! What are you doing?

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.042
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Don't!

00:55:38.751 --> 00:55:39.999
I said no!

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.918
CALLER ID BLOCKED

00:56:04.999 --> 00:56:07.417
I told you it'll be over soon.

00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:09.999
I mean it!

00:56:11.999 --> 00:56:13.999
Hello, are you okay?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.417
What's happening?

00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:18.083
If you can't speak,

00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:22.042
give us your location
and we'll dispatch a unit.

00:56:22.626 --> 00:56:23.999
Hello?

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.417
Excuse me.

00:56:40.679 --> 00:56:41.638
Dojin.

00:57:47.792 --> 00:57:49.500
I really hate waiting.

00:57:51.639 --> 00:57:53.553
My husband delayed me.

00:57:53.577 --> 00:57:54.542
Did you bring it?

00:58:24.268 --> 00:58:25.893
This is all I have.

00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:44.167
FOREIGN EXCHANGE

00:58:48.751 --> 00:58:50.250
The number you have dialed...

00:58:51.999 --> 00:58:54.792
FOREIGN EXCHANGE

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.129
You sold it way too cheaply.

00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:04.325
To Kang Hwirim, right?

00:59:06.901 --> 00:59:09.982
It's okay.
I got it back.

00:59:54.751 --> 00:59:56.042
Told you, didn't I?

00:59:56.792 --> 00:59:58.999
There's nothing about you
I don't know.

00:59:59.999 --> 01:00:01.923
Keep your head down
from now on.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.792
Or your family will be in danger.

01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:21.500
Did you think I only had
people tracking you?

01:01:22.292 --> 01:01:23.876
Are you alright?

01:01:30.999 --> 01:01:32.709
INSTALL APPLICATION - YES

01:01:35.956 --> 01:01:37.038
I'm sorry.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.999
- I have diarrhea.
- Not constipation?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.167
I found a contact in China.

01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:52.876
For the right money, they'll smuggle
people and goods in and out.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.417
And even...

01:01:56.999 --> 01:01:58.125
...kill people?

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:04.417
If you lure Jang Taegu out,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.375
they'll handle the rest.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.999
I'll pay triple.

01:02:15.626 --> 01:02:16.542
Do as I say.

01:02:17.626 --> 01:02:18.999
Don't listen to him.

01:02:18.999 --> 01:02:22.959
This goes against the code.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.999
The people I trust the least
are junkies.

01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:35.876
The story will go like this.
After a long investigation,

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:38.792
I was going to catch you
red-handed on the scene.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.292
But you attacked me,
and I defended myself.

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:44.334
You look like shit.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:47.209
If you'd listened,
you would've kept your life.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.959
Cleaning this up
is a pain for me too.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:01.999
Eunsoo, run!

01:03:20.867 --> 01:03:22.283
You fucking leech!

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:23.999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Are you okay?
Let's run.

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:30.125
I'm not running.

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:33.944
You want me to live off the money
I made selling you out?

01:07:34.292 --> 01:07:36.834
Wow, extraordinary.

01:07:36.876 --> 01:07:39.327
You lost again, dumbass.

01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:41.999
Mr. Lee...

01:07:42.709 --> 01:07:45.667
Not always.
You said it yourself.

01:07:45.709 --> 01:07:48.487
If you grab someone's weakness,
it can become your own.

01:07:49.343 --> 01:07:50.252
I'll turn myself in.

01:07:50.643 --> 01:07:54.860
Unfortunately, the thing I hate most
is unfairness.
