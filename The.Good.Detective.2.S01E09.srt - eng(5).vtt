00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.220
Let's think about it again.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.470
It's too hasty.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.850
This is the best way. Please follow my lead this time.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.140
I'll take care of everything.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.550
I'm sorry.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.060
I can't trust you.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.790
"I'm sorry."

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.430
Please follow my lead this time.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.770
I'll take care of everything.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.860
I'm sorry.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.790
I can't trust─

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.080
That's the sound of the seat belt unbuckling.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.480
At the time of the accident, Woo Tae Ho's seat belt was not on,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.380
and Cheon Na Na had her seat belt on.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.910
Cheon Na Na released Woo Tae Ho's seat belt on purpose?

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.530
To keep herself alive but kill her husband?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.350
Was she saying, "even if I die, I need to kill him"?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.820
Let's say that's true. But that 'tak' sound recorded on the dash cam,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.410
that sound is the only piece of evidence.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.690
Do you think we can call a person a killer just with that single sound?

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.370
[Episode 9]
The police have officially declared a vehicle accident as the cause of Woo Tae Ho's death.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.340
Mrs. Cheon Na Na, who was in the car at the time, is reported to be at work now.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.660
There are a ton of reporters.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.540
There's a reporter I know. It'll be a headache if he sees us.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.130
- Try to make contact, and if you can't reach her, let's quickly leave.
- Okay.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.030
Do you seriously think she would answer?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.320
Do you really think she's not too busy to answer your call?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.080
We're in the company lobby.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.550
I checked the dash cam in the car.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.510
Can we talk for a moment?

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.700
Due to the sudden death of Mr. Woo Tae Ho,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.220
public attention is focused on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.410
the alimony trial between TJ Group and the bereaved family.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.630
It is expected that the reason for the divorce between the two

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.230
will emerge as a major issue in the forthcoming trial.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.180
Did Hui Joo like you?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.300
No.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.080
I...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.130
liked her.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.650
When she died

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.200
were you

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.390
sad?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.680
Mrs. Cheon Na Na, who was a passenger at the time of the accident,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.280
has not made any official statements.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.860
Hey, there's no answer, right?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.930
No.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.770
I wonder what Woo Tae Ho wanted to say to us before he died.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.920
Whatever it was, he probably said it to Cheon Na Na first.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.370
So then,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.230
the person who ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder... to Cheon Na Na...

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.140
Yes.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.090
Cheon Na Na probably knows who the culprit is.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.260
Let's go.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.080
Excuse me!

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.400
Director Cheon requested that I bring you upstairs.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.010
Why is that woman making you do this kind of work?

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.180
Why do you keep getting roped into these kinds of incidents?

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.750
I'm an employee here.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.090
You said you're going to quit. Get out of this place quickly, please.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.660
I'll take care of my business.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.440
I won't do anything to concern you, so don't worry about it.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.990
By any chance, before Team Leader Woo Tae Ho died, did he say anything to you?

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.330
Or do something suspicious?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.340
Stop getting her involved!

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.980
Anyway,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.590
I didn't hear anything.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.860
That's good then.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.580
Don't think about it.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.160
It's just a car accident. A simple car accident. Think of it like that.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.000
Don't think about anything else, okay?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.340
Please keep your thoughts to yourself

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.020
instead of just spewing them out randomly.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.150
And remember, the person we're meeting with right now

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.010
is a person who lost her husband not so long ago.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.600
Welcome.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.540
Are you a detective as well?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.710
Yes, he's my partner.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.640
Yes, hello.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.830
- Sorry for your loss─
- Thank you, Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.620
You can go.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.350
Yes.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.390
Please sit down.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.670
I'm sorry. I'm in this state, so I can't even serve you any tea.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.770
It's okay. We need to head back promptly after we finish.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.230
You said that you checked the dash cam in the car?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.240
Yes.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.620
Why? Was there something strange in it?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.500
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho contacted us right before the accident.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.450
He had something to say about the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.240
He said he was coming to the station.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.680
Did he

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.580
ever talk about something like that?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.040
You don't have to answer right now.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.000
You can rest a bit, and when you remember─

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.310
I'll do it.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.160
Since I think it's something I'll have to tell someone eventually.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.600
I won't feel uncomfortable telling you, Detective Oh,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.930
because you and I have a lot in common.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.340
I was next to him when he was on the phone with you two.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.970
There was a bit of a fight.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.570
My husband said it was for me, but in the end

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.090
Cheon Sang Woo is still my brother.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.130
How could a sister enjoy hearing someone saying they would turn her brother in?

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.870
Are you saying Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.070
ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder?

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.370
What are you talking about?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.710
The assault case from two years ago.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.550
He was saying he would reopen that case that he covered for.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.440
He said that my brother would be arrested if he testified.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.590
If that case had been brought to light, Mr. Woo Tae Ho also would have been arrested for manipulating evidence.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.160
Why would he?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.690
My husband said that it was for the best.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.970
He

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.750
wanted to make me the top of the group.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.150
If my brother were arrested, he thought I would be taking over his seat.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.970
He said I didn't have to worry about him.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.720
That, worst case, he would be released on probation.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.230
I was not to say anything and was to follow his, the former prosecutor's lead.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.030
"I'm sorry."

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.050
Hey.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.260
Why did you say you were sorry?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.040
Isn't that something you should be thankful for?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.910
He was a man who was going to sacrifice himself to send you to the top.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.010
Because I didn't trust him.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.530
It was so disgusting.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.440
He's a man who betrayed me.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.350
A man like that would sacrifice himself for me?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.250
This is the best way.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.800
Please follow my lead this time. I'll take care of everything.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.480
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.410
I can't trust you.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.130
I can remember his face at the time.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.600
He looked like he had given up on everything.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.810
He must've been surprised.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.350
Because that's the first time he found out that woman was the reason why I announced our divorce.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.230
So he was surprised,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.900
and for a moment, your husband, who had his hands on the wheel, made a mistake?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.550
- Is that what you're─
- I think I told you everything I needed to.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.620
Yes.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.880
Thank you for sharing your personal story. It must be difficult to share.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.060
Now then.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.010
Mr. Woo Tae Ho's seat belt was not on.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.120
Who released the seat belt?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.550
Hey, he might not have had it on in the first place.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.970
If he hadn't worn it, there would've been a warning sound.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.510
There was no warning sound on the dash cam,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.570
so that means somebody

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.930
released it while he was driving.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.850
She was in the accident with him.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.130
How would she know that in that situation?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.970
I killed my husband,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.530
because I

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.850
didn't kill him myself,

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.450
but he died because of me.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.310
If I hadn't shown him that photo at that moment...

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.450
If I hadn't pushed him so much

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.060
then he wouldn't have died.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.240
For the rest of my life

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.940
I'll be tormented

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.470
and suffer pain as bad as death.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.600
Since my family,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.710
my precious family died because of me.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.310
I still didn't hear the answer to my question.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.420
Who released the belt?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.880
If he were trying to kill me, he would've released my belt.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.290
He let me live.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.800
I believe that was last gift of sincerity

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.270
he gave me while he chose death.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.360
I ask the two of you,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.490
please think of his cause of death as a simple accident.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.680
That's

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.140
the last considerate thing I can show him,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.520
the person who protected me.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.060
No matter how much I think about it, in Cheon Na Na's story,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.280
there's not a single suspicious thing. Everything fits perfectly.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.750
Have you ever gotten every question on a test correct?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.100
Are you attacking me as a person? As if I would've.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.580
There's one single way even a person like you could get all the answers right.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.780
I've never even got a hundred on a dictation test.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.650
What if you wrote the questions?

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.270
Think about it.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.320
It feels like we gave a question, and Cheon Na Na solved the answers, but...

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.280
I'll do it.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.180
Since I think it's something I'll have to tell someone eventually.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.930
... before we even asked about the conversation on the dashcam,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.870
she brought the conversation up first.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.360
My husband said that it was for the best.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.440
I was not to say anything

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.210
and was to follow his, the former prosecutor's lead.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.640
Because I didn't trust him.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.140
When I asked why Woo Tae Ho's seat belt was not on, instead of answering...

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.950
I killed him,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.940
because I

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.300
didn't kill him myself,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.300
but he died because of me.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.610
If he were trying to kill me, he would've released my belt.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.100
He let me live.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.990
And she cleverly changed the question.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.020
She gave us a question.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.920
"Do you know why Woo Tae Ho himself chose death in that moment?"

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.930
She then answered with a prepared answer.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:35.400
I believe that was the last gift of sincerity he gave me while he chose death.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.280
Today, Cheon Na Na both gave and solved the questions.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.840
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were here.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.180
What do you need?

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.910
We were thinking we need to clean up the office.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.320
Just leave it.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.060
Director, this office has a lot of things that shouldn't be leaked.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.050
- If we leave it as it is─
- Didn't I just say to leave it?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.920
Yes, I understand.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.520
Let's go.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.020
I'll call for you later on, so go home for now.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.770
I have something to say about Jeong Hui Joo's murder case.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.410
I'll tell you the details when I'm at the station. See you.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.320
Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong, can we speak for a moment?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.860
Just a moment.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:47.220
This case is drawing a lot of attention. People want to know more about it,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.770
so there's a strong possibility of being misunderstood.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.270
No personal information of the team leader should be leaked.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.530
Especially the actions of Team Leader Woo before the accident; you must never talk about that. Do you understand?

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.000
Yes, I understand what you're saying.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.720
Okay.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.440
If, by chance, even a single piece of information was leaked,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.790
the person inside who leaked it would be fired

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.530
as well as be sued by the company.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.400
Then that person would waste the rest of their life

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.170
to pay back the damages, right?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.010
Take care.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.790
I'm sorry for making you feel alone.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.880
Don't suffer so much. Please.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.110
Thank you for all your work.

[Jeong Hui Joo Severance Pay]

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.920
[Would you like to delete this file?]

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.430
What is it?

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.480
Hello, we have something to ask you.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.620
I'm sorry. I really have nothing to say.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.960
Please leave.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.970
The day before Mr. Woo Tae Ho died, he came to your salon, right?

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.030
We checked through the security camera.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.410
What did he talk about?

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.710
Please.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.000
I might actually die.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.060
By any chance, do you feel your life is being threatened?

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.890
I'm saying that if I keep meeting with you, Detectives,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.800
I might die.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.010
So, please stop coming here.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.300
I'm really scared.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.840
Ms. Kim Min Ji, you have to trust the police.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.330
We are the only ones who can protect you.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.020
Please contact us if there's an emergency.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.680
We won't come back until you do.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.440
Woo Tae Ho found an important clue when he met Kim Min Ji.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.430
We can only know what Woo Tae Ho meant to tell us when we find that clue.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.260
And we would also be able to find out why Woo Tae Ho died.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.420
Do you think Kim Min Ji is making excuses because she doesn't want to testify?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.070
Truthfully.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.580
She's feeling it truthfully.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.680
"I might die like Woo Tae Ho".

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.970
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho was here not too long ago, right?

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.180
What did he talk to you about?

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.610
Why did he die?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.840
It was an accident. A car accident.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.720
Where?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.160
I don't know exactly where.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.930
He was a good guy.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.990
That's a shame.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.360
I said, "What did he talk to you about?"

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.610
I've got more concerns.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.560
"What in the world should I do?"

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.390
"Which person's neck should I grab

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.600
to stay alive?"

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.660
Don't you trust me?

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.370
You'll be released.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.580
Don't do that.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.920
If I go out, I'll die too

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.710
from an accident.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.070
Stop imagining things.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.470
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho really died from an accident.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.190
The place where Woo's accident happened.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.270
I know that place.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:05.120
because on that day, I also went by that place.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.250
Out of all the places,

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.050
why was he in an accident near a place I told him about?

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.440
Why did you do that?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.470
Why would you say such a thing to Team Leader Woo?

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.680
I've lived my life lying so much,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.930
so I wanted to be honest for once.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.810
But maybe it's because I did something that I usually don't do

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.920
that end result was bad.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.910
But what can I do?

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.930
The only tool that I have right now is

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.160
honesty.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.190
Just honesty.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.490
Tell the person who's behind you,

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.760
"I don't know when that bastard will stab us in the back,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.800
so we should never

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.770
do anything to provoke him."

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.830
Hello.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.690
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Do Chang from the Incheon West Station.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.380
Did you follow me?

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.750
Absolutely not. We had some business near here, and this guy

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.810
said you were a police sunbae he knows, so I'm saying hi.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.540
You must be quite close with Gi Dong Jae.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.360
We requested a visit and were refused.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.420
What do you need from Gi Dong Jae?

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.500
There's a visitation record that Woo Tae Ho visited Gi Dong Jae on the day he died.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.590
So we were curious to know what they talked about.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.560
You're not in charge of Woo Tae Ho's death case, are you?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.700
As you know, there are many occasions where cases overlap.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.590
If we worry about who's in charge, we can't solve cases.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.180
What did Gi Dong Jae say?

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.820
What did he say to Woo Tae Ho that day?

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.190
Should I tell you honestly?

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.870
He asked me to deal with you guys.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:10.070
That you guys are bothering him by roping him into a random case, so he asked to take care of you two.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.940
You must have someone quite powerful behind you

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.970
seeing that Gi Dong Jae is asking such a thing.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.550
I was a policeman before as well.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.950
I wouldn't do that even if I could.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:25.910
However, if it causes harm to my current employer

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.080
then I'll have to reconsider it.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.450
I'm a bit busy, so...

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.620
They want to try me, huh?

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.000
Did he just say he could fire us if he decided to?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.330
Who does he think he is?

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.400
He doesn't have that kind of power.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.860
That's why he's just running his mouth.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.250
I told you, he's the guy who made me take a leave of absence from work two years ago.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.120
He'll come punching soon where it hurts the most.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.210
You guys recently summoned the deceased Woo Tae Ho, right?

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.610
Yes. We called him in for interrogation as a witness.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.120
Did you tell him that he was being investigated under allegations of ordering a murder?

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.460
We couldn't say it upfront.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.840
Even if you didn't tell him upfront, you still must've told him in some kind of way.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.940
By pushing the photos of him and the deceased Jeong Hui Joo, you pressured him, no?

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.690
Well, that's... Wait, why are you suddenly bringing that up?

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.010
The prosecutor called earlier.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.950
"Was there unwarranted pressure during the interrogation?"

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.900
"Could the car accident be due to the psychological pressure he felt from the police?"

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.930
What?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.760
No way.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.430
What do you mean pressured by us? It was we who were interrogated instead.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.480
He even said that he would sue us for forcing him to testify under duress.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.910
He did that because he felt pressured, right?

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.810
Perhaps the prosecutor is suggesting that Woo Tae Ho died because of us?

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.480
Who's the culprit that ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder?

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.000
Woo Tae Ho, or Cheon Sang Woo?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.090
Well, that's not yet...

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.290
The day before the accident, Woo Tae Ho called us.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.320
I think he was trying to tell us who the criminal was.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.340
Then,

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.470
are you saying the culprit who ordered the murder is not Woo Tae Ho?

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.040
Yes, that's what we think.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.270
Hey, then the problem just got bigger.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.120
Excuse me?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.460
I looked into the Woo Tae Ho case.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.080
He wasn't drunk, and there was nothing that would've caused the accident.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.570
It is most likely that Woo Tae Ho did it on purpose.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:34.330
If it's judged as a suicide, they'll make it our problem.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.910
On top of that,

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.820
you guys, who pressured him by shoving affair photos when Woo Tae Ho isn't even the culprit,

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.060
Violent Crime Division Team 2 will be held accountable.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.170
And the lawyer from TJ called as well.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.340
They've requested that we disclose the videos of Woo Tae Ho's interrogation.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.120
What do you think the bereaved family would think if they saw that?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.520
You guys know very well who those bereaved people are, right?

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.230
Using coercion to make statements through intimidation may infringe on human rights

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.410
and be illegal.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:17.050
Please submit the information that we discussed today to our legal department in writing.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.100
After discussion, the two of you will be notified directly

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.720
whether we will file a lawsuit against the law enforcement officer in charge.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.990
Thank you for your time.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.240
You're keeping Gi Dong Jae from spilling anything, right?

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.310
Yes, of course.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.110
There's no aftermath, right?

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.340
No.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.030
However, it's not as if there aren't any problems.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.460
The Incheon West Station found evidence that Gi Dong Jae killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.280
They've already sent it over to the prosecution as well.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.500
What did the prosecution say?

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.550
I think they're still reviewing it.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.450
Can't you control the prosecution?

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.840
I'm sorry, it's beyond my reach.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.060
Woo Tae Ho had to die at such an important time.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.010
The prosecution was in his hands.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.830
You must have had a lot of trust in Team Leader Woo.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:19.610
I didn't trust him, but he has been quite helpful.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.970
For now, I'll be responsible for the police investigation.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.980
The prosecution is quite uncomfortable with this case.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.950
That means if the police stop, there's no reason for the prosecution to continue.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.220
Do you think you can do this?

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.310
Do you?

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.310
Can I trust in your ability?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.320
I'll do my best.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.230
Then.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:57.850
If Tae Ho were here, he would've taken care of it all, but now this is...

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.090
I'll tell you since I don't think you know.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.720
The sentence for the murderer and the person who ordered the murder, is the same.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.520
Are you telling me because you really think I didn't know that?

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.620
I told you because I thought Team Leader Woo wouldn't have informed you of that.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.050
Take care.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.560
Why is there such a big deal over some girl named Jeong Hui Joo dying?

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.200
Yes, Vice Chairman?

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.040
Just,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.740
I forgot something earlier.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.560
Yes, go ahead.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.280
Tae Ho's seat is too big to leave empty.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.620
Right?

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.900
I think you should take the position as team leader of the legal team.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.160
Continue as a sub for a while,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.880
and I'll make sure you'll get an official notice for the personnel transfer.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.400
Yes, I understand.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.410
I look forward to your work.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.700
Yes.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.770
I'll do my best to satisfy your expectations.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.180
A chaebol's son-in-law dies in a car accident.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.150
The police announce it as a simple accident, but that's weird.
[The car legal team leader Woo Tae Ho and Cheon Na Na were in]

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.680
Why did it happen right after the one-sided divorce announcement?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.970
And why did it happen with the alimony trial looming?
[We think alimony problem will go to trial...]

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.410
What a shame.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.360
I mean, even if he just kind of settled,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.910
he would've gotten a huge amount of money that normal people can't even imagine.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.070
Who do you think this is?

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:41.520
She was known as a victim of a serial murder not so long ago until the culprit confessed:

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.330
"I didn't kill this person."
[Serial killer Lee Seong Gon *shocking confession* "I didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo!"]

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.820
These are the photos the police obtained during the re-investigation of the case.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.210
This was the reason for the divorce.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.560
The most important thing is, due to these photos of an affair,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.830
the deceased son-in-law of a chaebol

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.650
might be kicked out without getting any alimony money.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.260
The death of the son-in-law of a chaebol incident may not be a simple car accident.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:12.390
It may be the result of an extreme choice made by a man who suffered enough to die.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.010
I would like to ask the police investigator who obtained this photo and conducted a one-sided coercive investigation.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.670
Could this incident have been a fatal accident caused by a simple car accident?

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.420
What? Why is he ending it by saying something like this?

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.020
Does he have something against the police, or what?

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.380
Let's not worry about it. People enjoy this kind of provocative news,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.400
so they're just throwing whatever together.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.740
We just need to ignore it.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.170
The view count is over three million, and it keeps going higher.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.780
Three million? Is that a lot?

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.690
It means more people have seen it than the broadcasted news.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.090
Why did he make such a stupid thing?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.740
What good does it do for him?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.240
It's an intentional program. They were after two things.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.600
Turn people's attention to the divorce issue of a chaebol family.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.350
The attention over Jeong Hui Joo's murder case is now buried behind.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.330
And by turning the Woo Tae Ho incident into a suicide case, the detective in charge will be held accountable.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.030
They're trying to interrupt our investigation.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.950
So that means the group supporting the guy who streamed this is TJ.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.920
Correct.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.060
I said I won't do it. Damn.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.790
Hello Team Leader!

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.370
- Yes, can you give me one beer, please?
- Okay.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.250
I'm going crazy.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.120
Hey, don't you think we shouldn't have messed with TJ?

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.360
Don't worry about the stream. That's just his subjective story.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.640
No one will believe it.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.120
I don't know what stream you're talking about, but that's not important right now.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.800
Remember how I told you that my sister-in-law's husband works for a contracted group at TJ headquarters?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.080
Right, anyway, according to him, the contracted group was moved somewhere else!

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.290
The bastards at TJ did that on purpose!

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.530
Isn't it going a bit too far trying to connect that to this? That's something that just happened coincidentally.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.080
It is a bit fishy. It feels like it overlaps with the timing of that stream.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.150
I have no idea what stream all of you keep talking about,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:32:00.210
but anyway, if all of this happened because I'm investigating them, it's a serious issue─!

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.540
Enjoy.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.050
Business is going well, yes?

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.270
Well, well, sort of.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.690
It'll do well because the chicken is so delicious.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.040
But I found out that the business doesn't do well just because the chicken is good.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.210
Why?

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.500
Isn't the taste of chicken the only thing that matters at a chicken restaurant?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.470
Right in front, right across from here, another chicken restaurant is opening.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.510
It's a big chain restaurant, so I'm a bit worried.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.640
Which one?

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.570
BK Chicken, you probably know it.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:36.200
Aigoo. This is just a tiny business district. I don't know why they're opening a chain place right in front.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.160
I think I saw it on the news. Oh, right! Chills!

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.490
That company is the company that got into trouble because TJ gave preferential sales to every building it built!

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.530
That's right, that's right. I think I saw that news too!

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.780
Connecting anything you can, are you?

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.370
TJ is behind this!

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.670
They're reaching to your chicken restaurant too!

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.070
Everyone, just think about it.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:00.770
Has there been anything else suspicious similar to these coincidences happening around you?

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.650
Stop talking nonsense! What are you, a child?

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.610
Not so long ago,

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.940
my landlord said they're going to sell the house.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.810
They said they're moving to a foreign country after selling the house out of the blue.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.100
I heard the reason, and apparently, it's related to TJ.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.510
So what happened was the landlord was drinking at a hostess bar,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.590
and coincidentally, learned all about the corruption around TJ's Cheon family.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.400
The problem is, he just needed to keep it to himself, but he went around talking his head off.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.600
Think about it, Chairman Cheon Seong Dae is currently in jail. It's the most sensitive time for them.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.250
Then one day, his whole family was out eating, and all the family members got food poisoning.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.530
All the other people who ate there were fine, it was just their family!

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.560
So, it means they put poison in their food.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.330
Oh my, oh dear.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.500
Hey, do you think that makes sense?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.220
Why doesn't it make sense?

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.870
Someone give me a million dollars and see what I'd do to the chicken.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.140
You've gone crazy for money.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.510
What if that's not chicken?

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.950
It's a cheese ball.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.520
I'll just have one of those.

I'm asking why you did such an overwhelming thing.

You showed it to your uncle, so you're good, right? Say goodnight and go to bed.

Keep getting high scores, and you can be a CEO, a chairman.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.720
Come on, put him to bed. He couldn't sleep and waited until he could show you.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.900
It's way past his bedtime.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.950
Okay, go to bed.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:25.070

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.610
I'll buy you anything.

By the way,

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.740
what if TJ holds a grudge against us and retaliates, as Team Leader Woo said?

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.010
Do you really believe that? He was just joking.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.640
You never know. Jae Woong might work for TJ one day.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.340
I'm worried he'd be disadvantaged if that happened.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.930
You're overreacting. Why are you already worrying about Jae Woong when he's so young?

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.960
When we were young, was there a TJ or not?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.230
It was there. It was a conglomerate at that time too.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:14.000
Later, when Jae Woong is older, who knows if it'll grow even bigger?

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.540
I'm going to go out for a bit.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.140
Where are you going so late?

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.220
I was going to visit Grandpa.

Yes. I saw the livestream earlier.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.820
It talked about his grand daughter.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.780
I thought he would be sad if he saw it. I want to go check on him because I'm worried.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.700
Let's go together.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.890
- Keep this safe.
- Okay.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.210
Be careful.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.530
- Sir.
- The phone you have dialed is turned off.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.350
Sir?

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.190
He turned off his phone. I think he went home.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.730
He probably did.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.900
He's a very wise person, so he's probably okay.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.930
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.030
Let's go.

If you don't want them to be publicized, we can keep them to ourselves.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.980
N-No.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.750
Catching the culprit is the most important.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:40.090
Don't worry about me, and publicize them if you need to.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.130
Mr. Woo Tae Ho,

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.440
I've done such a terrible thing.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.710
Let's have a cup of tea inside.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.050
Okay.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.500
You must come here often.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.240
I come here when I miss my mom.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.720
My mother passed away here.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.990
Even on the day of the accident, you were here, right?

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.380
With your husband.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.500
- Yes.
- What did you talk about?

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.080
What did we talk about...?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.740
I think we mostly talked about the divorce.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.810
Don't my mom and I look quite similar?

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.910
People often tell me that I look more like my mom than my dad,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.290
even in terms of personality.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.970
Before the accident, Team Leader Woo Tae Ho met with two people.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.500
Kim Min Ji,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.530
and Gi Dong Jae.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.230
He heard something from those two. Both of them

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.250
are people related to the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.690
And the place that he hurried to

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.830
was here.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:42.520
It's just as I heard. You're really persistent.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.800
He was digging into the Jeong Hui Joo case, and he made a conclusion.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.730
That's why he called us,

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.230
to tell us who the culprit is.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.370
But then suddenly,

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.580
he was in an accident.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.100
Why are you so obsessed over this case?

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.000
You're going at it as if it would kill you not to catch the culprit.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.790
Because that's my job.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.350
You can't sleep at night, right?

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.350
Because you're curious who the culprit is.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.050
Kim Min Ji, Gi Dong Jae, and then you.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.840
Why were you, Cheon Na Na,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.160
the last one?

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.250
Are you suspecting that I killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.860
"I killed Jeong Hui Joo,

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.500
and my husband found that out."

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.640
"That's why I killed my husband by faking a car accident."

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.620
I wanted to kill her.

Woo Tae Ho, who loved such a woman,

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.790
I wanted to kill him too.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.400
But the two died.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.770
Does it mean that I killed them?

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.170
You must be quite confident.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.830
"You can't find the evidence

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.350
that I killed him." Isn't that what you're saying?

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:12.460
- Are you confident you can find it?
- Yes.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.240
If you can't find the evidence, you can't arrest the culprit. Isn't that right?

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.750
Yes.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.430
That's right.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.820
Have you ever gone through,

"That person is clearly the culprit, I know it."

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.360
"I saw it with my own eyes,"

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.770
but you still couldn't catch the culprit?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.050
Isn't that the reason you became a detective?

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.800
"I could kill that person."

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.560
Because you didn't want to become a killer. Because you were scared.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.000
That's why you became a detective, right?

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.360
I'll see you again.

Seeing how others are bowing to him for someone his age.

You don't have to do that.

And

you purposefully came to my store to check on Hui Joo, didn't you?

I'm saying that she's a bitch who deserved to die.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.270
She's a trashy bitch that latched onto a rich married man just to suck money out of him.

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:42.180
She died because God punished her, not me.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.750
Do you understand?

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.920
My goodness,

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.810
what are you doing? Hurry and help him up!

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:53.520
Don't touch him.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.000
Get out of the way, or you'll get hurt.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.360
I said not to touch him!

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.570
You little...

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.000
Come. Come and hit me.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.360
I'll fall foaming at the mouth.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.230
What? Are you scared?

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.890
Just tap me, and I'll hit my head on the floor and die for you!

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.940
Hey, you freaking garbage.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.290
Freaking garbage.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.960
Freaking garbage!

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.360
Let go! Damn it!

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.860
Grandpa lost his dearest granddaughter not so long ago!

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.720
But even then, he came to apologize with his head down in case she caused any discomfort

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.970
to a piece of garbage like you!

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.200
Let go!

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.580
If you insult Hui Joo in front of Grandpa one more time,

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.550
I'll kill you!

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.420
Let go! Let go!

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.780
Let go!

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.660
Eun Hye.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.160
Grandpa, let's get out of here.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.520
I shouldn't have brought you here.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.700
I'm sorry.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.430
No. You did nothing wrong.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.580
Let's go. I'll buy you something tasty.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.490
Damn old man.

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:25.380
Excuse me, just a moment!

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.630
That safe,

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.170
I have something to check.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:55.490
Please enter your passcode.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.140
If you have any other favors, contact me again.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:13.060
Okay. Good job. Drive safe.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.890
Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.010
Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong!

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:31.670
Ms. Moon─

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.650
[Myeongjin Safe]

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.480
The person inside who leaked it would be fired, as well as get sued by the company.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.110
Then that person

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.660
would waste the rest of their life

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.270
to pay back the damages, right?

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.350
Mr. Oh In Gyoo.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.750
Mr. Oh In Gyoo.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.210
Yes?

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.710
What is it?

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.050
- Team Leader.
- Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong,

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.660
you took something out of the safe earlier, didn't you?

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.630
That...

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.410
What is it?

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.150
You'll have to tell me the truth.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.090
If you don't, this will become a serious issue.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:59.030
It's this.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.040
Ms. Moon Bo Kyeong.

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:04.910
It's this.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:09.050
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho said that if something were to happen to him,

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.830
I should take this out of the safe and hand it to you.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.330
What's in it? Did you check?

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:19.710
I'm giving it to you right after removing it from the safe, so I couldn't check.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:24.240
Then why was it so urgent that I had to come out in person to get it?

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:29.940
It's such an important thing that I was worried someone might take it from me.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.870
I'm sorry.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.800
I tend to have anxiety.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.050
I think I was mistaken.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.090
Good job.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.560
I'm sorry, Team Leader.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:53.240
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho said only to give it to Director Cheon Na Na, so

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.040
please don't be upset. I was just doing as I was told.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:53:59.720
Okay.

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.660
Good job.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.490
Mr. Oh In Gyoo!

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.470
Mr. Oh In Gyoo!

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.540
Yes?

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.820
Can you lend me the tablet just one more time?

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.070
If you say that now.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.640
Okay.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.790
Okay.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.620
You heard what the lawyer said earlier, right?

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:36.210
If we go to trial like this, you will be ruined!

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.960
Don't worry. We can buy a lawyer too and fight them face to face.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.440
Their claim is a stretch.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.870
We win, no matter what, if we go to trial.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:46.410
Oh, right, what happened?

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:48.470
The friend who has that law firm,

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:50.570
did they agree to represent this case?

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.010
Initially they said they would.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:56.030
However, after I mentioned TJ, they immediately changed their attitude.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.770
See, see, see?

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:02.270
This is the reality! TJ is this scary!

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.810
- Don't worry.
- Why?

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.190
Do you know another lawyer?

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.730
We just need to find out the truth behind the Jeong Hui Joo case. If we do that,

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:12.880
the questions about Woo Tae Ho's death will be revealed, and the lawsuit itself will be invalid. Simple, right?

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.660
Do you want to know an even simpler way?

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.220
You and I go drown ourselves in the Incheon sea.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.060
We go to the afterlife to hear the truth from Woo Tae Ho and Jeong Hui Joo.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.040
Don't you think that would be even easier and faster?

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.450
Ms. Bo Kyeong! What brings you here?

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.710
- Bo Kyeong!
- Why? Is something going on?

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:30.480
Detective Oh, I have something to tell you.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.370
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho left me a memo before the accident.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.780
It's a password to a safe.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.580
Inside that, there was this.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.580
I didn't come to check on you recently, did I?

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.730
I was very busy. I'm sorry.

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:53.170
It's okay. I'm always grateful to you.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.710
Ms. Jeong Hui Joo

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:57.470
spoke about you sometimes.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:00.820
It's the content of Woo Tae Ho and Kim Min Ji's conversation.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.240
But she had nothing she could do to help,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.370
so she felt sorry.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:08.610
You, Ms. Jeong Hui Joo, and Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:12.120
You just need to tell me what only the three of you know.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:17.160
Hui Joo showed me the security footage of the assault case from two years ago,

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.080
instructing me to use that to get my child back.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.890
If Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo refused,

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.710
she said she'd take it to the police herself.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.580
So,

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.220
did you tell Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.770
exactly what Ms. Jeong Hui Joo said?

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:42.930
What did the vice chairman say?

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.310
He got angry,

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.120
saying, "Why don't you trust me?"

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.650
and, "Soo Yeon's my daughter too. Do you think I'd do something to her?"

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.810
"Why are you so eager to take her from me?"

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.590
And?

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.880
He said I can never have Soo Yeon.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:04.450
So I responded that I or Hui Joo would take it to the police and reveal everything about what happened.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.410
He said for the rest of my life,

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:15.270
I'd never be able to see my child.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.770
And

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.660
he said he'd order someone to make sure that Hui Joo

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:25.110
couldn't talk.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.760
He said, "She had an affair with the team leader anyway,"

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.180
and, "She deserves to die and more."

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.080
Did he say...

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.510
Did he say that's why he killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:45.190
I thought he would just threaten her.

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.110
When I heard that Hui Joo was a victim of a serial killer,

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:50.650
I thought, "Ah, Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo didn't kill her."

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:55.200
"Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo wouldn't have sent a serial killer to kill her."

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.910
But...

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.260
that serial killer

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.540
said he didn't kill her, so...

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.450
Why are you saying that just now?

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:11.910
If you had told me this earlier, Ms. Jeong Hui Joo wouldn't have died!

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.990
Hui Joo said she couldn't trust you either...

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.550
because she learned that you

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.670
eagerly covered up the assault case from two years ago.

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:26.280
She thought that you were on the same team as

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.010
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.650
That's all I know.

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:35.550
My Soo Yeon.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.970
You wouldn't get her back for me, would you?

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.720
I had a niece.

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.000
Dad!

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.090
Ah, you surprised me. What brings you here?

00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:58.550
I waited so I could go home with you.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.430
Oh my.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:02.650
Dad.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:05.370
Buy me some clothing today.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:08.250
Hey, what do you do with your salary?

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.120
You buy it yourself.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.350
You have to buy it no matter what, because

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:17.610
I did something quite good as your daughter today.

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.490
What did you do?

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:23.330
If your pretty daughter says so, so just believe it. Let's hurry.

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.770
The department store will close.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.220
This has made the connection between the three clear.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.300
Cheon Sang Woo ordered Choi Yong Geun to murder Jeong Hui Joo,

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.450
and Choi Yong Geun ordered Ki Dong Jae to murder Jeong Hui Joo.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.040
He was trying to tell us this by contacting us.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.490
"Cheon Sang Woo ordered the murder."

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:45.840
This means that what Cheon Na Na testified to us mostly fits together.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.390
The culprit is Cheon Sang Woo.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.730
We don't need to worry about anything else.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.610
Jeez, why is the atmosphere so chilly in here!

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:57.400
We've returned! The most powerful partners in the universe, Ji Man Goo!

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.420
Byeon Ji Woong!

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.220
- Come back!
- Come back!

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:05.300
These cheeky idiots.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.290
How are you feeling?

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.690
Really good. My head's actually clearer now!

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.950
Do you want to see something cool?

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.120
- Five times eight.
- Forty

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.050
- Seven times eight.
- Fifty six.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.870
When his head exploded, the neurons that had been sleeping their whole life were surprised and all woke up together.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:21.280
He became super smart.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.290
Twelve time thirteen?

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.900
- I'm not answering that.
- One fifty-six.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.820
You're so annoying.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.090
If he wants to get to that level, he needs to break his head two more times.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.820
How about you? Any problems?

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.230
He turned out great too.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.940
His IBS has totally disappeared.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.330
So does this mean that bastard Gi Dong Jae cured you of your illness?

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.030
You're talking nonsense again.

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:46.220
We must make gi Dong Jae rot in jail for the rest of his life!

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.360
Hey, don't worry about it. We'll get your revenge for sure, okay?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.280
Yeah, we should... But Hyeong...

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.530
I think Gi Dong Jae will be released soon.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.640
What bullshit are you talking about?

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.440
Well, it's...

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.420
Are you sure Gi Dong Jae stabbed you?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.380
Yes.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.970
- That's right.
- If we want to indict him with charges of wounding an officer,

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.140
you need to tell me for certain.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.450
That day, did you see Gi Dong Jae stabbing you?

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:20.420
Seriously.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:23.660
I'm telling you, it was Gi Dong Jae that stabbed me.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.310
Gi Dong Jae said he didn't stab you.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.670
You can tell if you check the weapon he was waving around.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.190
Weapon? What? The knife you use to carve meat?

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.610
Yes!

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.090
What a shame.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:39.600
At the crime scene, there were more than five people who held that knife.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.590
It's exactly what you testified.

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:48.210
However, I just changed the reason you chased Gi Dong Jae a little bit.

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.400
You know, right?

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.580
Detective Kang Do Chang forced Goo Jae Choon to think

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.400
that Gi Dong Jae was the person who killed their boss.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.540
By doing that, he tried to make Goo Jae Choon capture Gi Dong Jae so that he could arrest him, am I right?

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.910
That's kind of an illegal investigation.

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:08.170
By trying to put the guy who hit you in jail, Kang Do Chang might get punished instead.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.960
You want to release that asshole Gi Dong Jae, don't you?

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.670
You should've arrested Gi Dong Jae as a criminal in action.

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:17.370
A violent crimes detective, by a single gangster,

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.890
gets beat up, gets his skull fractured.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:24.740
You lost him because you were just too eager and caused another detective to get stabbed in the stomach.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.630
You didn't do anything good.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:33.540
Kang Do Chang, that person, is just a detective.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.740
He has nothing else he can do.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.770
I want to let him continue to live as a detective.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:42.960
In the position of detective colleague, you know?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.810
You read all of it, right?

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.970
Sign it.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:50.490
Detectives can't catch one hundred percent of the bad guys.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:55.050
It's not that embarrassing if you lose one or two bastards.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.630
So, did you sign the testimony?

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.280
What else could I do?

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.220
Well, it was all my fault.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.080
What was all your fault, you idiot?

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:16.970
Me getting hurt is fine, but Man Goo got stabbed because of me.

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:23.160
This happened because I didn't listen to you and said, let's move out on our own, and now...

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.230
Now again, because of me...

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.370
if something happened to you too...

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.150
Jang Gi Jin, is he even a detective?

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.930
How could he side with a gangster?

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.140
That bastard.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.210
- Hey, Do Chang!
- Hyeongnim.

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.320
Do Chang. Hey, where are you going?

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.360
Hyeongnim, wait for me!

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.980
- Hey, where are you guys going?
- Wait for me, too.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.680
Hey, hey!

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.950
What are you doing? Detective Oh, go hold them back.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.450
I think things would get more serious if I were to follow him.

[Seoul Metropolitan Investigation Team]

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:01.750
What about the rest of the guys?

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:04.480
They'll come after they finish the report and send the opinion paper to the prosecutor.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.120
Let's go first since it seems like it'll take some time.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.700
Tell them to leave it and come out. It's nothing urgent.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.460
We have to go to that restaurant with the reserved number of people.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.610
Yes, okay.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:15.510
Hey!

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.740
What is it now?

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:21.130
You bastard.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:23.030
Are you messing with my guys?

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:27.100
Do you think my guys are idiots that can be messed with, you freaking bastard?

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.440
Why are you releasing Gi Dong Jae?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.560
That bastard killed a person. So why?

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.730
Do you really want to get fucked?

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:32.940
You bastard, you...

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.020
Are you crazy?

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.570
How dare you wave your fist around here?

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.460
- Let go!
- Hyeongnim!

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.020
You bastards!

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:44.190
Stop!

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.190
Come over here.

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.330
Let go! Let go!

Why does it seem like Woo Tae Ho killed himself?

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.330
I told you to sneak out what he hid, not to use it yourself!

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:30.480
You need to testify at the trial and say exactly what you said to Mr. Woo Tae Ho.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.040
Things keep getting complicated.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.020
Don't you think it'll be a bit too dangerous to go as far as the detectives' families?

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.350
You can't. Not without my permission.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.570
I think Na Na is trying to find dirt on me.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:43.240
There's no one to protect the vice chairman now.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.870
I think he's holding onto something in case he gets blamed for everything.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:48.990
We need to find it.
