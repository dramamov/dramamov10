You're drunk.

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:23.383
You shouldn't drive.

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:26.860
They don't have checkpoints when it's raining. Don't worry.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.057
I want to get off.

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:29.473
Here?

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:31.197
I'll call a cab.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.822
We'll hit the city soon.

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:34.480
I'll let you off there.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.055
Please, CEO Oh.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:37.265
Why?

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.681
You don't want to be with me, not even for just a second?

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.518
No, it's not that.

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:44.323
What is it then?

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:47.355
What did I do wrong?

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.862
I have a boyfriend.

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:54.770
I don't want to do anything that will give him the wrong idea.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.653
Why do I have to care about a piece of crap like him?

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:04.488
Why?

00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:06.982
Please let me go.

What are you going to do if I refuse to let you go?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.008
CEO Oh, please...

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.483
Don't go. You're getting wet.

What should we do about this painting?

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:02.050
Should we get rid of it?

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.761
Put it in the company's storage room.

00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.418
I'm sure I'll want to see it again.

A little bit more.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.652
I want to stay here a bit longer.

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:29.809
I'll wait for you outside.

[Yoo Jeong Seon]

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:57.075
There's not a lot of time. Get the CCTV footage from around the scene.

00:03:57.075 --> 00:03:59.942
And don't trust the footage too much. Conduct thorough interviews.

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:02.120
It's the basis for an investigation. Got it?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.244
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:06.730

Let's go.

Welcome back.

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.989
We didn't get assigned to any cases today either?

00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:30.561
If you're bored, go get them on your own.

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:32.862
What's the point of asking for cases?

00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:34.833
They'll get assigned to a different team anyway.

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.736
Why is he doing this to us?

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.743
Come on. Are you asking because you really have no idea?

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:42.323
It's because he wants us to get F's on our evaluation.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.410
We won't be able to work if we don't get cases.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.467
And if we don't work, we'll naturally get F's.

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:49.599
What did we do wrong?

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.019
Is it because of Do Chang?

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:54.410
Okay, but what did Do Chang do wrong?

00:04:55.324 --> 00:04:58.468
Three, two, one, zero.

00:04:58.468 --> 00:04:59.394

Let's go home.

My wife is so happy because I've been coming home early these days.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:05.932
That must be nice.

00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:09.923
We don't have wives who greet us when we come home early.

00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:11.447
It's not all good.

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:14.540
My wife has been keeping...

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.940
a secret I discovered.

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:20.338
She has a huge mole on her butt.

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:23.475
We've been married for 16 years, and I just found out about it.

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:30.109
As I've told you, my father created almost all of the structure.

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:32.074
Are you still hung up on that?

00:05:32.074 --> 00:05:33.998
It's all over now.

00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:36.264
You should go home.

00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:37.491
I still have a lot left to do.

00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:42.630
I will give up on all of my business.

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:47.274
If you find evidence that I've broken the law,

00:05:47.274 --> 00:05:51.900
I will gladly receive the legal punishment.

Yes.

00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:08.319
My company runs all of the buildings in that area.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.647
If you're not happy with it, you can move to a different building anytime.

00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:14.492
You don't have to worry about the lease.

00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:16.316
Thank you.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:21.029
Are the detectives still bothering you?

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.011
Well, not yet.

00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:25.309
They'll lay low.

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.533
I'm sure they realized it after the trial.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:33.074
No matter how hard they try, they're no match for me.

00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:36.040
Do you know Detective Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.892
Yes.

00:06:36.892 --> 00:06:39.550
He worries me a little.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.211
You don't need to worry about him.

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:42.438
He's nothing.

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:45.919
I did my research, and it seems like he doesn't let go easily.

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.345
There's a high chance that he'll keep digging.

00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.142
Let him be.

00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:57.399
All right then, I'll just watch him for now.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.823
If he keeps bothering you,

00:07:00.624 --> 00:07:02.342
you can kill him.

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:05.936
What's wrong?

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:07.827
Because he's a detective?

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:11.290
Won't it be more thrilling to kill a detective?

00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:17.044
Messing with a detective is a dangerous thing to do.

00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:22.291
Well, you're the expert, so I guess it is dangerous.

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.739
Keep an eye on him. You can go now.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.402
But I'm not an expert at killing people.

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:42.799
There's no one who kills people easily.

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:50.214
You know how difficult it is to kill someone.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.318
You should be careful,

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.002
so Detective Oh Ji Hyeok doesn't get something that leads to you.

00:08:21.046 --> 00:08:23.452
Aren't you going to greet me?

Hello, Chief.

00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:29.123
You were disqualified from the promotions.

00:08:29.123 --> 00:08:30.272
It's not my fault.

00:08:30.272 --> 00:08:31.982
You brought this upon yourself.

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:36.416
Of course, the superiors weren't happy with you after your testimony.

00:08:37.157 --> 00:08:39.052
See you later.

00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.210
You should lie real low

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.388

I think they're all done now.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.055
I used to hate even the smell of beef intestines.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:34.258
It's strange.

00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:38.655
I like it now because you kept buying it for me.

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:40.925
It's the opposite for me.

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:44.174
The smell of beef intestines disgusts me now.

00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:50.490
Our office got an order

If someone asked me

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.610
who the most real detective in Korea is,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.759
I'd say it's you.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:09.984
The prosecution has mentioned your perjury.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.148
I think I'll be able to take care of that.

00:10:12.148 --> 00:10:14.103
It's not like they've got a clean record.

00:10:14.103 --> 00:10:16.927
What do you want from me?

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:20.153
Are you just trying to mess with me?

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.245
I've already told you.

00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:26.017
What happens to you is solely up to me.

Let me keep my detective badge.

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:35.452
There's something I need to do.

00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:37.176
I know.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.766
So what is your plan, moving forward?

00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:47.250
From now on

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.170
I'm going to turn a blind eye to things,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.183
and pretend I didn't hear anything.

00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:57.730
If they want me to,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.930
I will shut my mouth as well.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.691
So please don't take the detective title away from me.

00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:09.639
Does that answer your question, Lieutenant Yoon?

00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:16.320
You've made a wise choice.

- Damn, it's so heavy. This is the one, right?
- Yeah.

Hong Doo wanted me to give it to you.

And he doesn't want you to say hi if you see him on the street.

00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:54.819
Tell him I got it.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.915
Can you get me some cigarettes?

00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:59.972
Please show me your ID first, ma'am.

Who are you trying to be?

You can't disguise the smell of poop even if you spray perfume on it.

What did you draw? Let me see it.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.941
No! I'm only going to show it to Ms. Yoon.

00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:46.669
Come on, don't be like that.

00:12:46.669 --> 00:12:50.859
Please let me see it just once. It's my dying wish.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.818
I'll let you see this one.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.346
It's me. Wow.

00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:02.539
Even I can tell it's amazing even though I don't know anything about art.

00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:05.507
This doesn't look like it was done by a middle school student.

00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:08.412
Give it back to me now.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.414
Okay.

Eun Hye, when you become a famous artist later on, tell everyone that you don't have a dad.

What?

00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:23.369
It's embarrassing to have a dad like me.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:27.262
I won't be upset, so make sure you do that.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.158

- You can't drink now. Are you not going to work tomorrow?
- Never mind then.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:42.665
Go to bed. It's four in the morning.

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:45.472
You can go back to bed. Stop bothering me.

00:14:45.472 --> 00:14:47.844
What's wrong?

00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:52.748
It's because life is so shitty.

00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:57.358
It's so shitty that I can't sleep.

00:14:57.358 --> 00:14:59.119
Damn it.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.526
I'll get the drinks. Let's drink together.

00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:10.252
Forget it. Drinking with you will make me feel worse.

00:15:10.252 --> 00:15:12.059
Then what do you want me to do?

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:15.517
Go back to bed. Don't worry about me.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.770
Why is he acting like he's carrying the whole world on his back?

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.901
Are you in deep agony? That's only for people who actually have brains.

00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:28.731
Being like this doesn't even suit you.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.540
He's coming out.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.542
There he is!

00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:42.420
How does it feel to have been found not guilty?

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.935
The prosecution wants to make an appeal. How are you going to prepare for the second trial?

00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:49.418
The judge found you not guilty of only some of your charges.

00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:50.874
- Are you admitting to the rest of the charges?
- Did you expect it?

00:15:50.874 --> 00:15:53.760
- Please let me through.
- A statement, please.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.450
- How are you feeling?
- Do you admit?

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.440
- Please give an answer.
- Did you expect this?

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.970
- Please give us a statement.
- Say something.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.360
[Yoo Jeong Ryeol]

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.580
[Ministry of Justice]

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.735
He was found not guilty.

00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:26.730
I met with the prosecutor, and he's already preparing for the second trial because he expected the verdict.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.310
Gi Tae will lie low. I've already warned him.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.991
He'll have to lie low.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.600
This is a record of Lee Dae Cheol's retrial.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.228
There's a good chance Oh Jong Tae is the real killer.

00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:47.130
He clung to us because of that.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:52.123
The retrial is over and he was executed. There shouldn't be any problems now.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.921
Did you help Oh Jong Tae?

00:16:55.921 --> 00:17:00.045
It just happened to coincide with the hearing. There's no reason for me to do that.

00:17:00.045 --> 00:17:05.457
Okay. If it was a coincidence, then he is a lucky bastard.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.853
Let's go. We're going to be late.

00:17:08.853 --> 00:17:10.371
Okay.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.052
By the way.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.199
Did Oh Jong Tae kill that detective too?

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:22.086
I don't think he would be that stupid.

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:27.242
Well, I'm sure he thought he had enough power to get away with killing a detective.

00:17:27.242 --> 00:17:31.192
Distance yourself from him from now on. We shouldn't associate ourselves with him.

00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.638
Okay.

00:17:38.777 --> 00:17:43.644
Reporter Jin, you worked so hard on the case, but it all went to waste.

00:17:43.644 --> 00:17:47.264
Don't be too discouraged. We still have the second and third trials.

00:17:47.264 --> 00:17:52.885
With a lawyer like yours, I'm sure the verdict will remain the same.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.903
Trials aren't actually carried out in the courts.

00:17:57.903 --> 00:18:02.788
The result is decided by whoever writes the script.

00:18:02.788 --> 00:18:05.430
Like how it was with Lee Dae Cheol's trial.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.209
Why was the audio recording not mentioned at the trial?

00:18:12.209 --> 00:18:15.463
I'm sure it would've helped if it was used as evidence.

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:20.212
It was attacking the police and the prosecution. It wouldn't have helped.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:27.218
Did Senior Manager Yoo listen to that file too?

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.217
I see.

00:18:33.217 --> 00:18:39.602
"If the recording is revealed, your career will end." He convinced you like that by mentioning your career, right?

00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:42.436
It has nothing to do with him. It was my decision.

00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:47.460
Reporter Jin, did you have any intention of saving Lee Dae Cheol?

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.412
I get it.

00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:55.982
Killing yourself to save someone else is a very stupid thing to do.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.178
Red light, green light!

00:19:10.178 --> 00:19:12.291
Red light, green light!

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.760
Red light, green light!

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.001
Red light, green light!

00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:29.241
Red light, green light!

00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:32.318
Red light, green light!

00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:34.415
Got you!

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.432
The facilities are nice here, but the sauna is not that great, right?

00:19:56.432 --> 00:20:00.831
They don't make it hot enough. It doesn't feel that refreshing.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.544
My brother is having a hard time right now. He can't sleep either.

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.719
And?

00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:18.559
I'm also not in the right state of mind because of my son.

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:23.707
The house is a mess now that my brother is losing his mind, too.

00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:29.301
Can you come and clean the house? I won't make you pay for the room or the food.

00:20:29.301 --> 00:20:30.568
Why would I do that?

00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:36.355
It helps to have people around you when you're going through a hard time.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.269
I know you're having a hard time too.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.119
I'm fine.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:48.434
I went to go see my son today.

00:20:48.434 --> 00:20:52.040
That bastard got a restraining order,

00:20:52.609 --> 00:20:54.956
so I just watched him from afar.

00:20:54.956 --> 00:21:00.160
I want to just ignore what the law says and go give him a hug,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.444
but I'm scared my baby, Jae Hong, will miss me even more.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.850
That's how parents are.

00:21:12.402 --> 00:21:16.654
We only think about the pain we're in and not the pain that our children are in.

00:21:16.654 --> 00:21:19.695
But what hurts me the most

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.077
is the fact that when Jae Hong is in pain,

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:32.678
he has no one around to tell that he is in pain.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.679
I'll listen to your venting.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.341
Maybe that will comfort me too.

00:22:20.574 --> 00:22:25.184
Repoter Jin, did you have any intention of saving Lee Dae Cheol?

00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:26.359
I get it.

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:31.142
Killing yourself to save someone else is a very stupid thing to do.

00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:30.066
Aigoo, Jae Hong, you should quit drinking and start working out.

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:33.005
He's only good at running. He sucks at everything else.

00:23:33.005 --> 00:23:35.636
Were you lying about being a Taekwondo instructor in the army?

00:23:35.636 --> 00:23:37.169
Of course, he was lying.

00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:39.339
You're so oblivious.

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:42.415
You should've let him get a few punches in. What's wrong with you?

00:23:42.415 --> 00:23:44.815
What the hell are you talking about?

00:23:44.815 --> 00:23:46.377
Give it all you got.

00:23:46.377 --> 00:23:49.210
I'll kill you if you go easy on me.

00:24:10.129 --> 00:24:12.659
- Damn.
- Stop! Stop!

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:14.676
Are you okay?

00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.095
I'm okay.

00:24:17.095 --> 00:24:19.790
No, you're not! You're bleeding!

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:25.617
Hyeong, why did you beat him up? His nose might be broken.

00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:27.941
I didn't even hit him hard.

00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:30.251
You should've dodged it.

00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:31.553
Yes. Let's go for another round.

00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:33.013
What do you mean another round?

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:35.094
Look at you guys.

00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:37.207
You should've fought like that at your actual job.

00:24:37.207 --> 00:24:40.181
How can we fight when we don't even have any cases?

00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:44.213
We're so bored that we're fighting each other.

00:24:44.213 --> 00:24:45.929
Are all of you free today?

00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:49.686
There's an important matter, so make yourselves free if you're not.

00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:53.554
Let me see if you lost a tooth.

00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:54.717
Okay, one more round.

00:24:54.717 --> 00:24:56.043
A bloody nose means you've lost.

00:24:56.043 --> 00:24:57.883
Hey, what's up?

00:24:58.506 --> 00:25:00.763
I can't today.

00:25:00.763 --> 00:25:03.625
Can we grab a drink together another time?

00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:05.758
What about the rest of the team?

00:25:05.758 --> 00:25:07.809
Oh, okay.

00:25:08.292 --> 00:25:10.325
Another time then.

00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:11.842
Bye.

00:25:13.752 --> 00:25:15.552
Hey, Ji Hyeok!

00:25:16.864 --> 00:25:19.047
Are you free? Want to grab some drinks?

00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:21.782
I have plans tonight.

00:25:21.782 --> 00:25:24.014
Another time then.

00:25:24.014 --> 00:25:25.580
Hello?

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.950
What's up?

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.580
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.080
Bye.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.878
Hey, I thought you had plans.

00:25:34.878 --> 00:25:37.494
You didn't have any plans, and you made one just now, didn't you?

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:42.007
That was a woman just now.

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.621
See you later.

00:25:45.798 --> 00:25:48.588
Right, a woman.

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:50.465
I also have one.

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:53.121
A woman...

00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:57.509
Half of the people in this world are women.

00:25:57.509 --> 00:25:59.548
How come there aren't any in here?

00:25:59.548 --> 00:26:01.272
A woman.

00:26:07.949 --> 00:26:10.303
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:16.273
It must be nice to be knocked out after just one drink.

00:26:16.273 --> 00:26:18.936
I don't get why I can't get drunk, no matter how much I drink.

00:26:18.936 --> 00:26:20.360
Seriously.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.978
What's wrong this time?

00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:40.376
Why did Detective Kang testify like that in court?

00:26:40.376 --> 00:26:43.426
He knew he would be sacrificing himself.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.968
Why would he do that?

00:26:45.968 --> 00:26:49.087
He wanted to do everything he could to save Lee Dae Cheol.

00:26:49.927 --> 00:26:51.988
All by himself.

00:26:51.988 --> 00:26:54.732
It wasn't just him.

00:26:54.732 --> 00:26:57.368
Park Geon Ho tried to do the same.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.224
Listen to it.

00:27:12.224 --> 00:27:14.417
Hear what they're talking about.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.232
Prosecutor Jeong. Please use your power this once.

00:27:21.232 --> 00:27:24.134
Please talk to the auditor for me.

00:27:24.134 --> 00:27:26.326
I don't have much power.

00:27:26.326 --> 00:27:29.423
Don't you remember Lee Dae Cheol's case from five years ago?

00:27:29.423 --> 00:27:34.601
I would've let him go if you hadn't ordered me not to.

00:27:43.798 --> 00:27:46.388
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

00:27:46.388 --> 00:27:49.081
What is this? My birthday has already passed.

00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:52.671
You see, this is to congratulate for the four thousand...

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.540
Six thousand, four hundred...

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.462
- 6,428.
- Yes, 6,428.

00:27:57.462 --> 00:28:03.397
It's been 6,428 days since you've joined the force!

00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:05.289
What are you talking about?

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:06.974
Blow out the candles!

00:28:06.974 --> 00:28:08.390
- Blow out the candles!
- Blow out the candles!

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.786
- Blow out the candles!
- Blow out the candles!

00:28:09.786 --> 00:28:11.604
Okay, I'll blow it out!

00:28:14.335 --> 00:28:15.645
Congratulations!

00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:19.687
You've done a good job for 6,428 days.

00:28:19.687 --> 00:28:23.454
Stop thinking so hard and just drink.

00:28:23.454 --> 00:28:24.804
We only have soju.

00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:28.695
- Ah, okay.
- If you want anything else, you can go get it at the convenience store.

00:28:28.695 --> 00:28:29.596
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:30.578
- Have a seat!
- Come here.

00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:34.553
6,428 days? Unbelievable. Thanks anyway!

00:28:34.553 --> 00:28:35.918
Let's sit down.

00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:39.551
I can't believe you thought of this.

00:28:40.642 --> 00:28:43.109
When did you get this?

00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:46.939
Kim Gi Tae gave it to me before the last trial.

00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:48.192
Then how come...

00:28:48.192 --> 00:28:50.552
I made a mistake.

00:28:51.556 --> 00:28:56.694
If this had been exposed, could we have saved Lee Dae Cheol?

00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:01.211
Don't look at me like that.

00:29:01.211 --> 00:29:04.665
I'm already angry at myself.

00:29:10.538 --> 00:29:13.795
This is why he was executed.

00:29:14.712 --> 00:29:21.080
Lee Dae Cheol had to die to bury the fact that the police and the prosecution had set him up.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.180
All of our efforts were in vain.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.356
Lee Dae Cheol's sacrifice was already decided even before this game began.

00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.798
But still, I should've─

00:29:29.798 --> 00:29:32.507
Do you know what the misconception is that most reporters have?

00:29:32.507 --> 00:29:34.996
They think that they can change everything with just one blow.

00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:37.256
A reporter isn't the star of the show.

00:29:37.256 --> 00:29:38.941
Are you being sarcastic?

00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:40.777
You think it's funny for a reporter to feel guilty.

00:29:40.777 --> 00:29:43.560
I thought reporters care about facts.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.157
An audio clip wouldn't have changed anything.

00:29:46.157 --> 00:29:52.085
I think you should find out why they did it and why Kim Gi Tae gave this to you before the trial.

00:29:52.085 --> 00:29:57.234
Don't waste your time on unnecessary feelings like guilt.

00:29:57.818 --> 00:30:00.252
You were just hitting me with facts, not being sarcastic.

00:30:00.252 --> 00:30:01.802
Can you send this file to me?

00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:04.546
I think it will be really helpful for my investigation.

00:30:06.836 --> 00:30:11.681
And let me know right away when you find out what they're talking about.

00:30:12.217 --> 00:30:14.923
I need to get going. I have an important matter to attend to.

00:30:14.923 --> 00:30:16.823
Don't drink too much.

00:30:20.373 --> 00:30:22.073
Excuse me!

00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:25.969
Can you please put this bottle on hold for me and open a new 24-year-old bottle?

00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:28.278
That jerk over there will pay for it.

00:30:28.302 --> 00:30:29.802
Sure.

00:30:35.646 --> 00:30:41.090
I think Oh Ji Hyeok is planning to keep working on Oh Jong Tae.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.479
There won't be any more retrials.

00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:46.633
We won't be able to arrest him even if we have evidence that he's the real killer.

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.666
Eun Hui! Where's the soju?

00:30:48.666 --> 00:30:49.793
Eun Hui!

00:30:49.793 --> 00:30:51.635
Leave her alone, she must be tired.

00:30:51.635 --> 00:30:53.596
We can go get them ourselves.

00:30:53.596 --> 00:30:55.596
- Come on in.
- Hey! Have a seat!

00:30:55.596 --> 00:30:58.681
I thought you had plans with a woman.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.949
I ended it early.

00:31:00.949 --> 00:31:04.189
Ended it early? Ended what early?

00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:07.308
I guess he's dating someone. I'm jealous.

00:31:07.308 --> 00:31:10.011
It would be weird for him not to have someone with that face.

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.409
What about me?

00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:14.948
How come I don't have anyone with this face of mine?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.401
Do you care about how a woman looks?

00:31:17.401 --> 00:31:19.843
Of course, everyone cares about the looks.

00:31:19.843 --> 00:31:22.513
That's why you're single.

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.550
You have to think from the woman's point of view.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.397
Imagine if a woman had your face, would you date her?

00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:29.720
I totally get it now.

00:31:29.744 --> 00:31:32.235
Of course not.

00:31:32.235 --> 00:31:33.979
I just imagined it.

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:35.999
Me too.

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:37.610
Geez.

00:31:38.443 --> 00:31:39.485
Hyeongnim.

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:42.280
Does Eun Hui have a boyfriend?

00:31:42.304 --> 00:31:43.329
Why?

00:31:43.329 --> 00:31:45.313
She's my ideal type.

00:31:46.008 --> 00:31:47.042
Come on, man.

00:31:47.042 --> 00:31:48.844
She's a divorcee, and she's older than you.

00:31:48.844 --> 00:31:50.241
That doesn't matter.

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:53.846
Hey, Eun Hui is a judo gold medalist.

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:56.779
She'll slam you to the ground if you're not careful.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.489
Eun Hui reminds me of my mom.

00:31:59.489 --> 00:32:03.692
My mom would also throw punches first whenever she got angry.

00:32:03.692 --> 00:32:06.397
She's like my mom.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.990
I need to go.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.208
That was my wife.

00:32:13.208 --> 00:32:15.061
But it's not even that late yet.

00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:16.400
Let them be.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.952
They're like newlyweds these days. They're full of passion.

00:32:18.952 --> 00:32:21.161
Sorry. No need to get up.

00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:22.858
Just make sure you come to work on time.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:27.816
Just clock in first before you go to the sauna or do whatever you need to do.

00:32:27.816 --> 00:32:29.489
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:32.030
- See you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

00:32:33.527 --> 00:32:35.227
Hey.

00:32:35.227 --> 00:32:38.403
You're the one who arrested Jo Seong Dae, right?

00:32:38.427 --> 00:32:39.498
Yes.

00:32:39.498 --> 00:32:41.921
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

00:32:41.921 --> 00:32:44.924
I have to get that bastard no matter what.

00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:47.650
What was his charge again?

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.333
It was for the murder of Park Geon Ho.

00:32:49.357 --> 00:32:50.871
That's good.

00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:54.347
So it has nothing to do with Lee Dae Cheol's case?

00:32:54.371 --> 00:32:56.171
Right.

00:32:56.171 --> 00:33:01.067
We'll be able to get Oh Jong Tae
too if we get Jo Seong Dae.

00:33:06.309 --> 00:33:07.333
Hello?

00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.534
Long time no talk.

00:33:08.534 --> 00:33:12.087
But I thought Team 1 closed Park Geon Ho's case as a suicide.

00:33:12.087 --> 00:33:14.863
So what?

00:33:14.863 --> 00:33:18.570
I'm going to get him and pummel him to the ground.

00:33:19.495 --> 00:33:20.695
What?

00:33:20.695 --> 00:33:22.192
Han Dae Seong?

00:33:22.192 --> 00:33:25.300
He's a conscripted policeman at our station. Why?

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.460
[Police]

00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:44.710
I'm going to go inside and find out what happened.

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:46.171
You guys can wait here.

00:33:46.195 --> 00:33:47.695
Okay.

00:33:48.451 --> 00:33:51.764
Is Han Dae Seong the guy who was serving the chief?

00:33:51.764 --> 00:33:55.806
Then won't the chief take care of it if we call him?

00:33:55.806 --> 00:34:00.600
No way. He will probably throw a fit and send him to jail instead.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.660
Gosh.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.635
Are you busy?

00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:13.935
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes, sir.

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:27.586
You didn't tell the victims that Han Dae Seong is an officer, did you?

00:34:27.586 --> 00:34:29.840
- No, sir.
- Good.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.004
What happened?

00:34:31.028 --> 00:34:33.904
I guess he was drinking alone and got into a fight with them.

00:34:33.904 --> 00:34:37.162
Han Dae Seong is a really nice guy preparing to join the force.

00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:39.045
Is there any way to make this go away?

00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:42.348
He didn't get hit once while the other side got beat up.

00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:44.733
And it's hard to say they both assaulted each other.

00:34:44.733 --> 00:34:46.674
It's a bit complicated.

00:34:46.674 --> 00:34:48.477
Who were the guys who got beat up?

00:34:48.477 --> 00:34:50.791
They don't have a serious criminal record.

00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:53.548
But they have a few charges and received a few warnings.

00:34:53.572 --> 00:34:55.715
So they're just some punks.

00:34:55.715 --> 00:34:59.599
We can just take them and scare them a little to shut them up.

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:02.842
Give me all the cash you have.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.497
This won't be enough compensation! You only have 2,000 won (~$2)?

00:35:16.497 --> 00:35:18.838
You got nothing?

00:35:18.838 --> 00:35:21.474
Why is it all crumpled up?

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:24.315
Go and get some cash for me.

00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:25.216
At the ATM?

00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:30.216
I don't have much in my account, so just take out as much as you can.
(1M won = ~$1,000)

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.790
[Police]

00:35:41.063 --> 00:35:42.064
You're so cool.

00:35:42.088 --> 00:35:45.936
I thought everyone carries around that much.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.290
All right.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.590
Take this.

00:36:17.179 --> 00:36:18.267
Are you kidding me?

00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:21.029
- It's not enough?
- Of course not.

00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:23.531
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.099
Go easy on me.

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:34.535
That's all I have.

00:36:34.535 --> 00:36:36.516
Good evening officers.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.131
Don't get scared.

00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:46.936
We're just his colleagues from work.

00:36:46.936 --> 00:36:51.463
Wow, you guys look like you'll frequent our company a lot, huh?

00:36:51.463 --> 00:36:53.222
We'll treat you well.

00:36:53.222 --> 00:36:55.481
You can come anytime.

00:37:01.338 --> 00:37:03.632
Did you hear what Detective Kwon said?

00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:06.623
He said he was going to get Joo Seong Dae.

00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:10.010
Park Geon Ho's murder hasn't been assigned yet.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.610
If we work on it,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.216
we'll be able to get Joo Seong Dae and Oh Jong Tae.

00:37:14.216 --> 00:37:19.716
Chief Moon won't let you work on a case that Nam Gook Hyeon closed.

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:22.619
Then I'll have to catch Chief Moon first.

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:25.775
Lieutenant, he's a superintendent.

00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:29.032
You won't be able to touch him, no matter how hard you try.

00:37:29.032 --> 00:37:31.157
Yes, I can.

00:37:31.157 --> 00:37:32.718
I'll tell you the details tomorrow.

00:37:32.718 --> 00:37:36.572
Where the hell is that confidence coming from?

00:37:36.572 --> 00:37:38.400
From having you as my partner.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.830
So you can run off and blame me if shit hits the fan?

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.764
You finally get me now.

00:37:48.117 --> 00:37:51.117
You make it so hard for me to like you.

00:37:51.117 --> 00:37:54.121
- Hold on, stop the car.
- Why?

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.481
Eun Hye.

00:38:09.026 --> 00:38:10.826
What are you doing here?

00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:15.739
I'm coming home.

00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:17.176
Home?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.350
Yes.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.450
Blanket and pillow.

00:38:23.452 --> 00:38:25.660
Don't flush toilet paper down the toilet.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.807
It will clog it because the water pressure sucks.

00:38:27.807 --> 00:38:31.159
And fold the blankets in the morning and put them in the closet. Okay?

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:32.539
Enough with the nagging.

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:35.257
Please leave us alone!

00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:49.153
It must've been really hard for you.

00:38:50.121 --> 00:38:51.928
It's my fault.

00:38:51.928 --> 00:38:52.947
I'm sorry.

00:38:52.947 --> 00:38:54.547
No.

00:38:55.161 --> 00:38:59.719
My father and I should be thanking you.

00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:06.200
I know I can't tell you to forget everything, but

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:09.073
let's at least try.

00:39:09.073 --> 00:39:11.309
I'm going to forget everything.

00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:13.709
That's what my dad would want.

00:39:14.415 --> 00:39:18.889
But... I'm still angry.

00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:25.495
The man who killed Ms. Yoon.

00:39:26.454 --> 00:39:29.721
He must be living carefree.

00:39:30.339 --> 00:39:33.539
He should be punished for his crime.

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:36.798
My dad died because of him.

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:42.582
You're going to catch him for me, right?

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:49.306
Of course, I'll catch him.

00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:52.414
I need to let you see him locked up. That's my job.

00:39:52.414 --> 00:39:54.491
Promise me.

00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:03.595
If...

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:09.952
I ever get weak, please remind me again.

00:40:09.952 --> 00:40:13.833
Remind me to keep my promise.

00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:15.501
Okay?

00:40:17.409 --> 00:40:18.918
Seal.

00:40:23.193 --> 00:40:24.793
Copy.

00:40:40.254 --> 00:40:41.854
Hey.

00:40:42.616 --> 00:40:44.449
What did the chief say?

00:40:45.028 --> 00:40:47.127
It was my fault.

00:40:47.127 --> 00:40:48.406
There's nothing I can do.

00:40:48.406 --> 00:40:50.480
Damn it.

00:40:55.878 --> 00:40:57.444
What are you doing?

00:40:58.424 --> 00:41:01.346
Did you get the wrong room?

00:41:01.346 --> 00:41:04.549
Han Dae Seong didn't do anything wrong. Lift the suspension.

00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:06.473
He told me about everything.

00:41:06.473 --> 00:41:08.543
You would drink late at night and make him drive you home.

00:41:08.543 --> 00:41:10.211
You even made him tutor your kid.

00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:14.325
He waited more than three hours at the airport for your mother-in-law yesterday.

00:41:14.325 --> 00:41:17.311
And he messed up while he was drinking because of the stress.

00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:21.111
Who do you think is more at fault here, Chief Moon?

00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:24.662
Okay, fine.

00:41:24.662 --> 00:41:27.002
I'll let Han Dae Seong go.

00:41:27.002 --> 00:41:30.863
But what do you think will happen to you now?

00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:32.878
I wouldn't do this if you did your job as chief properly.

00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:36.006
Okay, let me tell you as the chief.

00:41:36.006 --> 00:41:39.433
You won't be able to join the violent crimes division ever again.

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:45.668
I'm going to make you clean up puke from drunks until the day you retire.

00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:51.474
You think this will make me quit, huh?

00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:53.666
I'll never leave. There's something I have to see.

00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:56.756
I need to see you cry tears of blood.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.920
Good job, everyone.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.280
- Did you check your mailbox?
- Yes.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.860
Yes, sir. Will send it shortly.

00:42:10.866 --> 00:42:13.663
This is why he was executed.

00:42:13.663 --> 00:42:15.055
Lee Dae Cheol had to die to bury the fact that

00:42:15.055 --> 00:42:20.021
the police and the prosecution had set him up.

00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:24.267
[Former District Attorney General, Kim Gi Tae]

00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:26.603
Hello, Reporter Jin.

00:42:26.603 --> 00:42:29.230
Hello, there's something I wanted to ask you.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.031
What is it?

00:42:30.031 --> 00:42:33.488
Who gave you that audio file and when?

00:42:33.488 --> 00:42:34.789
I'm not sure.

00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:36.347
It was a long time ago.

00:42:36.347 --> 00:42:39.838
That's the reason the execution was carried out, right?

00:42:41.341 --> 00:42:44.346
Oh, right. I remember now.

00:42:44.346 --> 00:42:47.412
I think it came from the Ministry of Justice.

00:42:47.412 --> 00:42:50.430
So it must've been when Lee Gyu Jo was the Minister of Justice.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:55.043
I'm meeting an important guest, so I can't get into the details.

00:42:55.043 --> 00:42:56.186
Okay.

00:42:56.186 --> 00:42:58.632
I'll call you again later.

00:43:11.997 --> 00:43:13.968
Okay, fine.

00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:16.412
Just make sure you keep your mouth shut.

00:43:16.412 --> 00:43:17.436
Yes, sir.

00:43:17.436 --> 00:43:24.815
I'll forget everything that happened between us back then.

00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:33.797
How should I deal with Moon Sang Beom to feel satisfied?

00:43:33.797 --> 00:43:36.346
We need to work on it a bit more.

00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:39.688
Won't both Chief Moon and Prosecutor Jeong go down if we expose this?

00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:43.768
I'm sure it was recorded by the auditing department investigating Chief Moon's corruption.

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:48.385
The police found out about the prosecution's corruption while investigating their own.

00:43:48.385 --> 00:43:52.673
The prosecution and the police will try to bring each other down.

00:43:52.673 --> 00:43:56.713
Then they'll realize they're both going down and come to an agreement.

00:43:56.713 --> 00:44:01.098
They'll wrap it up by crushing everyone who is related to this case.

00:44:01.098 --> 00:44:03.875
Chief Moon, Prosecutor Jeong...

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:05.044
and us too.

00:44:05.044 --> 00:44:07.365
I don't care about going down with them.

00:44:07.365 --> 00:44:12.331
But we won't be able to get Oh Jong Tae if we lose our badges.

00:44:12.331 --> 00:44:14.195
Where did you get this file anyway?

00:44:14.195 --> 00:44:17.912
It would've helped us a lot if we had exposed this at the trial.

00:44:19.392 --> 00:44:21.600
What can we do? It's already too late.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.471
Let's first find out what Chief Moon did that was mentioned as corruption in the file.

00:44:25.471 --> 00:44:27.862
I think that's our priority.

00:44:27.862 --> 00:44:29.339
That will be easy.

00:44:29.339 --> 00:44:31.727
If I put my mind to it.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.400
He usually asked me to do personal tasks for him.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.290
I see. Were those your main tasks?

00:44:38.292 --> 00:44:40.663
- Personal stuff?
- Yes.

00:44:40.663 --> 00:44:42.819
Usually after work.

00:44:44.847 --> 00:44:46.110
Thanks.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.950
- That helped us a lot.
- Yes, sir.

00:44:49.733 --> 00:44:51.866
Detective Kang?

00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:54.296
What is it? Do you have more to say?

00:44:54.296 --> 00:44:59.502
Will Chief Moon lose his badge when this gets exposed?

00:44:59.502 --> 00:45:01.728
He did do many bad things to me,

00:45:01.728 --> 00:45:04.458
but when my mother was sick and in the hospital,

00:45:04.458 --> 00:45:06.940
he came to visit and comforted us so...

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.639
Hey, he should be punished for what he did.

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:13.455
I'm taking the exam to officially join the police force,

00:45:13.455 --> 00:45:16.068
and the chief is part of the force too.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.060
[Interrogation Room 1]

00:45:22.062 --> 00:45:24.328
I really hope you join the police force.

00:45:24.328 --> 00:45:26.795
You'll be a good officer.

00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:28.948
Thank you, sir.

00:45:28.948 --> 00:45:30.718
Thank you.

00:45:47.452 --> 00:45:49.994
Good morning, Chief.

00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:54.100
I thought you would go all the way up to become Deputy Commissioner.

00:45:54.861 --> 00:45:57.059
Why did you─

00:45:57.059 --> 00:45:59.180
Never mind, it's too late now.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.964
Everyone gets sick if they're greedy and eat too much.

00:46:01.964 --> 00:46:04.490
And wrongdoings will eventually be discovered.

00:46:08.273 --> 00:46:10.603
Are you saying that to me?

00:46:10.603 --> 00:46:12.551
No.

00:46:12.551 --> 00:46:15.876
I was just talking to myself. Don't worry about it.

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:27.586
What is wrong with him?

00:46:40.244 --> 00:46:43.915
Is he looking for dirt on me?

00:46:49.738 --> 00:46:53.647
I heard the head isn't assigning cases to your team.

00:46:53.647 --> 00:46:54.712
Well, yeah.

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:58.046
The team didn't do anything wrong. How petty of him.

00:46:58.056 --> 00:47:01.089
I'll talk to Mr. Kim and take care of it.

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:03.340
We're already short-staffed as it is.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.815
We can't have experts like you guys just sitting around.

00:47:09.227 --> 00:47:14.461
By the way, do you guys still grab drinks with Kang Do Chang?

00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:16.842
I know you are all close with him.

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:22.567
You should've put it on vibrate!

00:47:22.567 --> 00:47:23.626
I apologize, sir.

00:47:23.626 --> 00:47:24.757
Go ahead and answer it.

00:47:24.757 --> 00:47:26.690
- Make it brief.
- Yes, sir.

00:47:28.197 --> 00:47:29.497
What do you need?

00:47:30.593 --> 00:47:32.381
Think about it.

00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:35.334
Would you be able to talk crap about your station if you were me?

00:47:35.358 --> 00:47:39.225
Hey, I didn't know the headquarters would change you this much.

00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:41.790
Chief Moon is listening, right?

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.189
Whatever. I'm in a meeting. I've got to go.

00:47:44.213 --> 00:47:45.813
Bye.

00:47:48.054 --> 00:47:52.269
I know it's just an act, but that hurt my feelings a bit.

00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:55.529
Who were you talking to from the headquarters?

00:47:55.553 --> 00:47:58.714
Oh, it's a colleague of mine who works at the auditing department.

00:47:58.738 --> 00:48:01.955
What was it about?

00:48:04.619 --> 00:48:09.533
He's asking me questions because he received a tip about bribery at our station.

00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:11.861
Like what?

00:48:11.885 --> 00:48:14.119
He won't give me the details,

00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:17.818
but I think it's about an executive.

00:48:20.483 --> 00:48:25.283
Chief, you should contact the executive officers and give them a warning.

00:48:38.709 --> 00:48:40.647
Hello, I'm Jin Seo Kyeong from Jeonghan Daily News.

00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:41.924
I'm a little busy right now.

00:48:41.924 --> 00:48:43.139
I'll keep this short.

00:48:43.139 --> 00:48:45.746
Why did you authorize an execution right before your retirement?

00:48:45.746 --> 00:48:46.860
Let's do this later, okay?

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:52.136
- We'll do it later.
- I heard you rushed it to help Congressman Yoo's political efforts, is that correct?

00:48:52.136 --> 00:48:54.350
- Where are you from again?
- I'm from Jeonghan Daily News.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.522
Did you get permission from your superior to do this?

00:48:56.522 --> 00:48:58.600
No, I did not.

00:48:59.944 --> 00:49:01.644
President.

00:49:01.644 --> 00:49:03.458
President!

00:49:22.098 --> 00:49:24.631
You look like a really nice girl.

00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:27.751
You look like a really nice man too.

00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:30.979
I'm sure you need a lot of money at your age.

00:49:30.979 --> 00:49:35.797
I'm sure there's a lot that you want to buy and do.

00:49:35.797 --> 00:49:37.128
Then you should give me some.

00:49:37.128 --> 00:49:40.128
Money is given to those who work.

00:49:40.128 --> 00:49:45.556
You need to do some work for me to pay you.

00:49:50.842 --> 00:49:53.209
Do you know Detective Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:49:53.209 --> 00:49:55.255
Okay.

00:49:55.255 --> 00:49:59.910
Can you tell me what he did

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.240
to a nice girl like you?

00:50:14.836 --> 00:50:18.069
Don't you remember Lee Dae Cheol's case from five years ago?

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:21.967
I would've let him go if you hadn't ordered me not to.

00:50:21.967 --> 00:50:25.209
Hey, Chief Moon, what are you talking about?

00:50:25.209 --> 00:50:28.296
You're the one who said we should bury that evidence.

00:50:28.296 --> 00:50:33.062
Why are you bringing that up now? You really know how to make something into a big deal.

00:50:39.691 --> 00:50:40.818
This is Jin Seo Kyeong.

00:50:40.826 --> 00:50:44.481
What is this? Why would you email me that?

00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:46.046
Did your senior manager tell you to do that?

00:50:46.046 --> 00:50:47.414
No, it's not that─

00:50:47.414 --> 00:50:49.288
What is Jeonghan Daily trying to do with me?

00:50:49.288 --> 00:50:50.833
President, I was just wondering─

00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:53.455
Yoo Jeong Seok is the one who set it all up.

00:50:53.455 --> 00:50:56.529
Now he's trying to put the blame on me?

00:50:56.529 --> 00:50:59.625
Is it because I'm not in office anymore?

00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:02.246
President, I think I made a mistake.

00:51:02.246 --> 00:51:03.317
What?

00:51:03.317 --> 00:51:05.903
I should've done more research.

00:51:05.903 --> 00:51:11.317
If you can just let this one go, I'll talk to my senior manager and drop the story.

00:51:11.317 --> 00:51:13.012
I apologize.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.590
Is this everything?

00:51:40.463 --> 00:51:44.864
What Han Dae Seong saw at his house was just the tip of the iceberg.

00:51:44.864 --> 00:51:47.397
He's in deep.

00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:50.009
Here we go.

00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:21.438
Turn the car around at the intersection after the tunnel.

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:22.214
What?

00:52:22.214 --> 00:52:25.490
He was in violent crimes for ten years.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.593
He'll know we are following.

No, did you not turn on the meter?

No, I'm going to get you a reimbursement because I'm tired of you flaunting your money.

I own that car too.

You have two cars?

00:55:13.862 --> 00:55:16.832
The other one is for work.

Right.

They should only hire detectives who are rich like you.

Reporter Song.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:49.491
Do you remember last year's suicide case of an officer from Incheon?

00:57:49.491 --> 00:57:51.434
Oh, that case?

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:52.908
That was a lot of work.

00:57:52.908 --> 00:57:57.420
They kept hiding it, so I even dug up the trash to get the story.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.562
But there was nothing special to it.

00:57:58.562 --> 00:57:59.994
Were you able to get anything at all?

00:57:59.994 --> 00:58:02.999
Well, I did find a discarded USB.

00:58:02.999 --> 00:58:05.267
Did you check the files on that USB?

00:58:05.267 --> 00:58:07.413
No, it was damaged.

00:58:07.413 --> 00:58:10.341
Senior Manager Yoo checked it after it was restored, but he said there wasn't much on it.

00:58:10.341 --> 00:58:12.974
So that was that.

But why?

00:58:15.955 --> 00:58:19.960
The suicide happened at around the same time as a case that I'm chasing.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.888
So I was wondering if there was a connection.

00:58:21.888 --> 00:58:24.189

This is why he was executed.

Oh, right. I think it came from the Ministry of Justice.

00:58:37.936 --> 00:58:40.007
Yoo Jeong Seok is the one who set it all up.

To be honest, that doesn't satisfy me.

You fabricated the evidence during Lee Dae Cheol's case

Why?

There's no other reason you would do that.

I just did what I believed was right.

01:00:06.526 --> 01:00:09.258
I was confident that Lee Dae Cheol was the killer.

01:00:09.258 --> 01:00:11.536
And I still am.

01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:16.047
Did I mess with the murder weapon? Yes, I did.

But if we hadn't found anything from it,

After all those days, do you think I just failed to distinguish who the real killer is
