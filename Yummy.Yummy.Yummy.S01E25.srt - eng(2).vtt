00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.120
Fengxia,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.430
please believe me.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.270
I really didn't do anything.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.620
My only mistake is

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.990
that when I entered this tavern,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.400
I should have gone in to see

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.680
if this is a legitimate one.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.430
If not, then I shouldn't go in.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.950
All these years,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.430
don't you trust my character?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.800
Come here.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.320
Sit here.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.800
Then let's make a deal.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.270
You can't hit me.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.520
Sit down.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.270
Shen Jianshe,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.150
do you still remember

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.400
how many years we've been married.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.590
It should be...

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.400
About 20...

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.080
33 years.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.480
The two of us,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.120
from modern times to Yong'an,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.220
have gone through all the ups and downs
over the years.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.750
I originally thought our days
would keep getting better,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.170
and the feelings between us

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.520
would also grow deeper and deeper.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.030
But now

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.080
I'm finding it harder to recognize you.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.310
Fengxia,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.710
this is what I want to tell you.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.640
I'm also torn about this matter.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.310
That day Yangyang told me,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.800
saying, look, after we came to Yong'an,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.960
Grandpa, you've become a top chef;

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.310
Gongcai

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.830
has a lot of fans;

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.680
Jicai is pretty good in every aspect;

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.400
only grandma seems unhappy,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.680
and didn't make any progress.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.920
I felt really sad when I heard it.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.870
Why did I say that day

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.270
you need to get to know us again?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.520
That is, you need to see our progress

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.710
and you have to see the good in us.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.870
You told me yourself

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.150
that I have a bad temper,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.870
I just hit you,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.110
scold you,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.760
pinch you, and kick you.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360
Do you know why?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.680
Money, I guess.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.270
Without money,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.480
life was hard.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.990
How could you be in a good mood?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.200
What I don't understand is

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.310
that we have money now,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.400
why do you still...

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.550
I don't understand.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.280
Ever since coming to Yong'an

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.280
you have all improved.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.900
Only I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.900
is still busy with pointless things
every day.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.070
I don't have a life of my own.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.360
When I get anxious,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.240
I just can't help but shout

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.070
and lose my temper.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.480
I really haven't changed at all.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.080
I'm so pathetic, right?

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.550
Well, you...

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.160
Shen Jianshe,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.920
do you still remember
what I looked like when I was young?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.470
I do.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.120
You look nice.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.150
Beautiful.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.600
But you have always been like this,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.680
always hitting and scolding me.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.430
Seems like you really
have forgotten everything.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.240
When we first got together,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.550
you said you like my gentleness.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.630
Because you can never make money,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.900
and I've always had to work hard,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.990
so I've developed this temper today.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.550
After coming to Yong'an,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.680
whatever you do is always right,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.070
no flaws.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.070
Everything you do is perfect,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.360
including the food you cook.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.280
It's all first-class as well.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.600
Do you believe it?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360
Forget it, let's leave it at that.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.870
I misjudged you.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.430
(Divorce Letter: Shen Jianshe
is heartless and unjust,)

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.280
(unworthy of being a father
and grandfather.)

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.180
(Li Fengxia divorces Shen Jianshe today.
This is to certify.)

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.560
This...

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.040
Divorce letter?!

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.380
(Capital Prefecture)

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.680
Young Master.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.680
Young Master.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.920
According to information provided
by Lady Zheng's husband,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.590
Vice Minister Cao

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.440
captured a group of people
from the Dou family.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.120
The Dou family?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.160
People from the Ministry of Justice

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.310
said there was suspicion about my
and my brother's household registration.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.070
They detained us.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.360
It was you who instigated it, right?

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.680
You are also an official.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.840
Illegal detention,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.190
abuse of torture.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.390
Aren't you afraid

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.750
of losing your official hat?

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.680
There isn't a single wound on your body.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.360
Who can prove that I used lynching?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.440
You...!

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.630
Dou Shiba,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.600
native of Fenglin Town,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.870
six years ago,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.630
administrative officer
of the Jinwu Guards,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.600
reported dead from illness later.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.160
In the registry,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.680
you are a dead man.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.120
Who will investigate

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.800
the whereabouts of a dead man?

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.330
Could it be

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.550
that it's the person behind you?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.240
That's truly something
I couldn't wish for more.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.630
I understand now.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.630
Your purpose

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.040
is to find the person behind me.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.680
Alright.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.160
I can tell you.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.360
The person behind me

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.070
is myself.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.950
You petty coward,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.480
I will never confess.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.360
You've used the water drip torture,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.840
and also steamed me.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.190
Bring it on.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.600
I can handle it.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.200
You don't dare to see blood.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.870
What can you do with me?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.870
Those people under you

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.990
have all been beheaded
and submitted to the law.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.200
These are the precious heads
of the brothers

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.870
who have gone through life and death
with you.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.750
If they can't stay with you,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.510
wouldn't that be a pity?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.910
You... what are you going to do?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.990
What are you going to do?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.030
You... how dare you?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.670
How dare you?

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.480
The man behind me

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.390
will never let you go.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.200
You petty coward!

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.840
You bunch of corrupt officials!

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.630
You bunch of corrupt officials!

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.360
You bunch of corrupt officials!

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.630
Don't!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.680
Don't!

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.080
The man behind me

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.870
will never let you go.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.360
Don't!

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.060
(Upright in Speech and Conduct)

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.240
He confessed all.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.750
You've already read the confession?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.840
It really is him?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.960
A few wooden balls,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.360
painted with some paint

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.600
and disguised as bloodied human heads,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.560
were enough to scare Dou Shiba
out of his wits.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.400
But how many people

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.270
have died in vain

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.600
because of him and that prince?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.420
(Testimony)

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.940
(...falsely reported dead from illness
but actually worked for Prince Zhao.)

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.900
(Dou Shiba)

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.440
The Dou family continually
amassed wealth

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.990
and then delivered them to his hands.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.360
They wanted so much money

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.960
just to support these people

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.030
and strengthen their own power.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
Both salt

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.920
and iron

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.320
are controlled.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.840
Prince Zhao needs these

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.270
and also provisions.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.710
Dou Shiba

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.720
is responsible for delivering money
and goods.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.200
According to him,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.960
things from everywhere

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.600
will be assigned

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.830
by a liaison.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.960
They were very cautious.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.320
Dou Shiba couldn't meet the liaison.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.960
They chose to meet at the ghost market.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320
That liaison

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.360
only sent his own attendant there.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.390
The market fears being caught
by the Jinwu Guards.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.550
So the location is not fixed.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.910
It's hard for us to stake out.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.200
However, Dou Shiba was quite cautious.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.030
He followed that attendant

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.390
and knew that person

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.430
has business in Juxian Alley.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.870
Juxian Alley?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.820
(Juxian Alley)

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.660
(Shen's Diner)

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.960
The Ministry of Justice
caught a group of thieves.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.120
They have a hideout in Juxian Alley.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.440
I just came

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.240
to remind you

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.200
to be extra careful in everything.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.630
That's all.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.350
You can go back.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.710
OK.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.990
Many thanks, Mr. Lin.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.320
It's the matter
of the Ministry of Justice.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.030
You found out so quickly

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.510
and even came specifically
to remind us to be careful.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.720
It's my duty

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.750
to ensure the safety of Juxian Alley.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.200
Could their hideout in Juxian Alley

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.960
be related to you reversing the case?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.840
We are more familiar with here.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.690
We can help you.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.580
None of your business.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.720
I understand now.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.390
Then I'll take my leave first.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.390
Mr. Lin, please wait a minute.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.790
You're getting busy.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.360
Did you forget to eat again?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.720
This is called a boxed meal,

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.870
easy to eat.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.780
(Try it with chopsticks)

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.790
It's your idea again?

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.560
This is the takeaway box I made.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.030
The meaning of 'takeaway' is,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.080
no need to worry
about wasting leftover food,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.910
you can take it away in a box.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.940
(Shen's takeout is really fast)

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.200
You bore no grudge

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.150
and personally came to deliver the news.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.720
We are extremely grateful.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.960
If you are willing,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.880
we can still deliver meals to you
in the future.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.920
Thank you.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.670
You don't have to.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.080
Just take good care of yourselves.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.120
Lady Shen.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.440
Young Master,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.200
I wasn't eavesdropping.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.750
I overheard it by accident.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.990
Why do you refuse

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.720
them to bring you food?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.200
I see

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.670
you're not angry anymore.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.860
(Try it with chopsticks)

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.780
(Shen's Diner)

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.960
We're back.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.480
You're back.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.320
Deyuan, thank you

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.600
for picking up Yangyang.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.320
Later we'll quickly hire another person.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.160
Not at all.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.440
You taught me, charge me up.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.150
Yangyang seemed a bit unhappy.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.870
She didn't say anything all the way.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.320
Your pout is so exaggerated
it could hang an oil bottle.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.670
Talk to me

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.270
who upset you.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.200
During recess today,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.510
everyone started talking
about their fathers.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.790
I said my father is especially amazing;

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.990
he works alone outside to earn money;

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.200
it's just that he hasn't come back
for a long time.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.840
But they all said

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.440
my father doesn't want me anymore.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.630
Which child talked so carelessly?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.740
It's fine.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.010
They didn't understand anything.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.750
- Auntie.
- Don't cry.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.360
You told me before,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.360
although my father is quite silly,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.840
and also unreliable,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.270
he loves me very much.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.750
He... he would never abandon me.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.560
But

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.960
he hasn't written since the New Year.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.360
He's so stupid

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.720
and so unreliable.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.270
I'm afraid something really happened
to him.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.390
No, that won't happen.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.790
Your father is a fool blessed with luck.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.840
He will definitely be fine.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.680
Excuse me, a letter for you.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.840
Give it to me.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.120
- See? Don't cry.
- Thank you.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.870
It must be a letter from your father.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.160
Milady.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.840
It's father.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.800
Family members,

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.560
this letter arrived a bit late.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.360
Because it took some time

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.710
to bravely climb to the peak.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.000
My acting career has begun
to take shape.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.320
I have the principal,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320
and plan

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.190
(Divine Pancake - Jianbing Guozi)
to run a branch of Shen's Diner.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.040
Hello, everyone.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.040
Everyone, look at me.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.520
Everyone, don't miss out

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.670
as you pass by.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.080
Everyone, come

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.920
and take a look.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.230
Everyone,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.630
I am the founder of Shen's Diner,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.430
a famous restaurant in Yong'an.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.870
Have you heard of it?

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.730
- No.
- No.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.610
Never.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.450
It's fine.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.000
Shen's Diner

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.600
is practically the second cafeteria

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.760
for the Vice Prefect.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.870
We have also prepared meals

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.360
at the poetry gathering

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360
of Princess Fuhui.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.520
So what I bring today

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.840
is the signature dish of Shen's Diner,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.320
Jianbing Guozi.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.870
Our Jianbing Guozi

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.800
are in limited quantity.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.840
First come, first served.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.320
Only ten qian each.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.180
Isn't it very cheap?

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.630
Ten qian?!

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.800
No, no, no.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.870
Jianbing Guozi?

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.230
I heard that it has been popular
in Yong'an for a while.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.760
But it is too expensive.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.840
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.080
You get what you pay for.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.280
Today, in front of everyone present,

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.080
I will give you all a demonstration.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.360
Is... is this pancake burnt?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.870
No, as for our Jianbing Guozi,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.900
the key is to first lightly
scorch the pancake

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.910
and then brush with oil.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.760
That way, it will be
both fragrant and crispy.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.120
How did it get burnt?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.120
This is exactly

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.430
the Divine Pancake.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.030
Have a taste.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.950
Try it, try it.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.870
Family members,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.120
I didn't expect

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.950
the dishes of the Shen Diner's
are so popular.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.470
Everyone's enthusiasm is unstoppable.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.780
This flavor is indeed...

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.420
(Pancake)

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.760
(Tea)
Thus

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.710
I have decided
to promote the franchise model

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.760
and let everyone get involved,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.150
so that Shen's Diner become famous
across the country.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.630
I believe everyone present here

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.390
is a business elite,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.040
all looking for high-quality

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.560
and promising projects.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.730
I,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.280
as the founder of Shen's Diner,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.670
can confidently tell you

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.600
that as long as you

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.870
join us,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.650
you are guaranteed to make a fortune.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.520
Join?

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.440
What does joining mean?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.920
Sir, what are you talking about?

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.490
We can't understand a word of it.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.150
Joining us,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.080
that is to say,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.520
if you all wish to open a restaurant,

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.430
you can

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.080
use the name of Shen's Diner.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.040
In this way,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.900
every month,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.320
I only charge you

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.360
500 qian.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.840
- 500 qian?
- 500 qian?

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.950
Don't believe him.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.040
He's just a fraud.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.390
How could I be a fraud?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.000
You run around the streets all day long.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.570
I've spotted you several times already.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.950
Aren't you the one who makes,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.120
makes pancakes?

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.870
Yes, I've seen him too.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:13.800
- Right?
- His pancake

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.470
is terrible, totally inedible.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.430
What's wrong with that?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.490
Can't I do something else?

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.430
As a talent like me,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.950
can't I have a diversified development?

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.190
You perform for a living today.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.270
You sell pancakes tomorrow.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.650
Do you have a single truthful word?

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.830
Why do I never have the truth?

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.120
Yes, yes, I remembered too.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.760
He's truly a fraud.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.320
See? I told you I wasn't mistaken.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.120
Report to the authorities
and arrest him!

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.460
- Stop.
- Arrest him, arrest him!

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.120
Don't let him get away.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.520
Don't run, don't run.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.600
Don't let him get away.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.770
Don't run.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.360
The franchise business is booming.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.630
I have also made many friends

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.560
because of this,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.670
which allowed me to smoothly step

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.190
(Groceries)

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.520
into calligraphy community,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.280
embarking on a new stage

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.360
of life.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.610
(My current situation requires me
to seek help from others.)

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.690
(I encountered some challenges
in my life)

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.560
(that temporarily put me
in a difficult situation,)

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.900
(and I am grateful for your help
or encouragement.)

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.950
Who doesn't have a child?

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.150
I'm really ashamed

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.190
going back to face Yangyang again.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.470
I miss Yangyang very much.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.950
Hope she enjoys going to school.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.100
(Recruitment)

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120
Let's take a look.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.000
What is posted?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.230
What is this?

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.870
Recruitment?

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.190
I never heard of this before.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.910
Please take a look.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.230
(Shen's Diner)

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.630
What is it for?

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.080
Thanks to everyone's support,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.430
the business of our diner

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.320
is becoming more and more prosperous.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.470
But nowadays,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.220
we really are too busy
to handle everything,

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.840
so we are posting a job advertisement

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.840
to find a helper.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.840
We are currently hiring a chef

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.600
who is skilled in cooking local dishes

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.120
and is also kind-hearted.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.520
Looking for slaves?

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.470
Then just find a broker to buy one.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.180
- Yes.
- Yeah, why make it so complicated?

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.330
We don't buy or sell people.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.040
And you don't need to sign a slave deed.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.870
A labor contract is Ok.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.150
Labor contract?

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.000
Then you can get paid monthly.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.440
If you're not happy with the work,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.800
give one month's notice in advance,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.120
and you can quit your boss.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.910
Quit the boss?

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.710
What is this labor contract?

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.000
Quit the boss?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.080
This must be a scam, right?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.670
It's really not a scam.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.470
I just signed the labor contract.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.000
I can take eight days off each month.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.280
And I eat my meals at the diner.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.040
- Yes.
- I can even keep a cat.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800
Sometimes I get up later than the boss.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.840
Really?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.840
It's true.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.950
Isn't this a restaurant?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.390
Why does it feel like a charity hall?

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.550
Exactly.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800
I can't believe it.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.800
What are you doing?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.690
Why are you pushing me?

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.370
No.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.230
Why did you tear it?

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.560
Others still want to see it.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.000
A low-grade eatery like this

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.630
only needs me

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.840
alone.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.040
What does this person mean?

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.820
(Shen's Diner)

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.120
Young man,

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.670
you know cooking skills?

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.880
No.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.850
No?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.630
Then why did you tear it?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.190
Why do you ask me such nonsense?

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.330
If I don't know how to cook,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.330
what do I come here for?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.960
Young man,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.950
don't just know how to talk big.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.560
Do you have real skills?

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.160
Have a taste.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.960
It's you.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.390
This fish is really good.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.230
Mr. Pei,

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.740
this dish, Peacock Spreading Its Tail,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.910
is made by Yu San

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.120
whom we newly hired.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.710
Not satisfied?

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.760
No, no.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.600
Delicious.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.630
Very delicious.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.000
Lady Shen,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.360
you introduce your chef to the public
in such a way.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.560
Aren't you afraid
that after he becomes famous,

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.710
he will ran away?

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.760
That's because he's highly capable.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.710
Being able to hire him
is my good fortune.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.000
Being able to keep him

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.270
is my real skill.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.630
During the festival,

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.840
you had a quarrel with the Princess.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.150
Haven't you made up yet?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.360
The entire court is talking

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.910
about that she has dismissed

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.280
all the men around her.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.150
How could I

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.230
let go?

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.230
Mr. Pei,

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.550
you're confident.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.190
Maybe Her Highness has grown tired
of them

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.190
or perhaps those people made a mistake.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.470
It may not have anything to do with you.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.200
Yes,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.000
maybe it's like this.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.360
So...

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.000
So it still has nothing to do with me,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.230
right?

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:53.760
Mr. Pei,

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.320
you clearly have Her Highness
in your heart.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.190
Otherwise, you wouldn't think this way.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.840
But what's the use?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.430
It's just like...

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.150
It's like you and Anran.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.040
Even I can see

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.390
that you like each other.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.230
But now,

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.520
no one is looking for each other
anymore.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.510
Forget it.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:22.800
Anyway,

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.670
he's about to get engaged
to another Lady Shen.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.910
Why bring that up?

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.360
During the court's adjournment,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.770
Chancellor Meng admitted it himself.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:31.840
He said that Anran is about

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.350
to become his granddaughter's husband.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.230
In fact,

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.280
we are both the same,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.230
both pitiful people

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.710
whose beloved

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.430
is far beyond our reach.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.430
What did you say?

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.870
You clearly heard it all.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.910
Why make me say it again?

Morning.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.120
Hello, Ms. Li.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.670
Hello, Mr. He.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.560
I often see you busy working
in the diner.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.040
How come you have time
to hang out today?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.840
Well, we just hired a new worker.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.000
He is capable.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.040
So I can free up my hands
from the kitchen.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.040
That's good.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.710
Take a look at the new jewelry
I just got.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.670
I also left one for my wife.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.670
- Really?
- Take a look.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.150
It looks really nice.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.800
The quality is indeed excellent.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.340
Let me tell you,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.620
when I first arrived in Yong'an,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.390
I sold my gold bracelet.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.240
I kept saying

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.840
that I want to buy one I like again.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.430
Let me give it a try.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.190
This one seems small.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.360
I can't put it on.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.560
My hands

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.120
have become rough

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.520
from all these years of hard work.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.120
Let me tell you,

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.430
I was very beautiful when I was young.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.150
A woman should complement the jewelry,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.650
not the jewelry complements the woman.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.710
That's not the case now, I'm old.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.870
It's OK.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.440
I

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.150
have prettier ones.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.870
Try this.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.120
The quality is better.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.320
You're familiar with my wife.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.710
She also often says
she's not good-looking anymore.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.670
Then I'm thinking

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.860
if she has gotten thin from being tired,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.080
no longer plump.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.190
Isn't it all my fault?

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.630
She likes jewelry.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.560
I just went into this business.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.910
If she is well dressed,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.080
she'll be happy.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.040
When a woman

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.120
is happy,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.600
she looks beautiful.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.190
Look at you.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.360
Mr. He, you're really good with words.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.120
Just for that,

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.800
I'll take everything

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.120
you have here today.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.880
Everything?

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.230
I can make money now too.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.760
Why should I still wrong myself?

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.630
I'll just buy whatever I like.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.120
If I buy it, I will be happy, won't I?

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.230
When I'm happy,
I look good no matter what.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.070
Isn't it?

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.390
That's right.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.670
Alright.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.670
I'll wrap it up for you.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.510
Alright.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.230
Here.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.230
Take it.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.230
Wrap all of these up for me.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.070
All of them.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.560
Make yourself clear.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.760
Why exactly do I have such a bad temper?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:33.800
How would I know

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.600
why you have such a bad temper?

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.910
When we were dating,
your temper was like this.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.000
When we got married,
your temper was also like this.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.280
From our wedding day until today,

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.670
hasn't your temper stayed the same?

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.400
Except hitting me,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.040
pinching me, scolding me,
and kicking me,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.120
what else can you do?

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.230
I am a man.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.800
I also have dignity.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.120
Can't you feel a little sorry for me?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.950
Why can't you be a bit more tolerant
with me?

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.840
Why can't you treat me a little better?

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.390
Ever since coming to Yong'an,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.190
you have all improved.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.900
Only I

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.840
am still busy with pointless things
every day.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.910
I don't have a life of my own.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.230
When I get anxious,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.190
I just can't help but shout

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.870
and lose my temper.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.360
I really haven't changed at all.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.150
How is it? Does it look good?

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.080
Very good!
I think every piece suits you.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.270
Alright.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.990
Wrap this up for me.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.360
- OK.
- I'll take this one too.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.870
These two, wrap them both up.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:35.840
- Come on.
- Alright.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.800
I'll take them all.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.870
Wrap them all up for me.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.840
OK.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.510
Here, take it.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.590
- Lady Li.
- OK.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.460
All wrapped up.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.190
Let me know when new goods arrive.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.120
Alright.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.000
Take care.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:48.910
I'm off.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.840
Nice.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.600
I'm really having a great time today.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:26.510
Nice.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.600
Father, where are you going?

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.760
You haven't been in the diner much
lately.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.220
My mother is not in the diner either.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.150
What have you all been busy with?

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.040
Your mother has been going out
alone a lot recently.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.040
I'm just worried
something might happen to her.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.870
I have to ensure her safety.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.710
So I just...

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.870
I... I followed her.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.390
No, she... she always goes out alone.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.870
Now she has money.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.230
When people have money,
they might turn bad.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.630
She is now rich.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.910
She might have...

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.060
Have what?

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.990
No, no.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.710
What I mean is...

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.550
Have what?

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.470
Well, what if, you know.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.670
What if...?

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.390
What did you find?

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.920
I...

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:33.230
I just...

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.550
I followed her for a whole day,

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.520
and watched your mother

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.800
buy, buy, buy.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.670
And nothing else.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.040
I'm really speechless.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.710
My mother caught you
going to the tavern.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.670
She never suspected you.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.630
You suspected her?

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.230
She even told you about this.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.230
Whatever.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.840
Anyway, I've got no dignity left.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.470
What else did she say?

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.510
My mother said she knows you're not

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.120
the kind of person with a wandering eye.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.430
I think so too.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.940
Father, you don't have any money
in modern times.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.670
You can't even tell
which place is a club.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.120
That's simply a mistake.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.630
That's true.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.040
That's just a misunderstanding.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
That's a mistake.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.950
Sit down.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.080
Well,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.310
am I your father

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.480
or are you my mother?

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.000
Listen to me first.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.270
Go ahead.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.270
Although you didn't
make a fundamental mistake,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.190
you really made my mother sad.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.750
I know it wasn't easy for you
to raise Gongcai and me.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:29.920
Especially my mother.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.400
She has been working so hard.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.230
I've seen old photos
of my mother before.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.440
She was very beautiful.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.890
When I was a child,
she also loved to dress up.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.700
But later, our family situation
got worse,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.520
and she sold all her jewelry,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.000
keeping only a gold ring

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.120
and a gold bracelet.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.440
After we came to ancient times,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.480
she sold these two

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.230
for us.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.310
Actually, after the diner was opened,

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.880
I also bought gold for her.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.800
But things like the ring

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.640
and bracelets

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.270
should be bought by you.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.440
So what did you end up buying?

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.080
A big carriage.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.480
Your performance completely
missed the point.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.350
My mother must be heartbroken.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.590
My dear daughter,

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.310
you don't know.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.480
Your mother has truly given up on me.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.920
She doesn't want me anymore.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.000
She wrote me a divorce letter.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.440
When we were poor before

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.350
and had no money,

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.080
she never said she wanted to leave me.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.960
But now...

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.270
(Divorce Letter)
We finally have some money now.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.960
She easily gave up on me.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.790
It's all my fault

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.310
for having a stupid head.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.350
I shouldn't have said those words.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.270
What did you say?

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.960
I said that she has a bad temper;

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.980
that she still dislikes me
for not having money.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.190
Then I also said she just knows
how to kick me,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.470
hit me and scold me.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.880
She has always been like this.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.080
Was my mother like this
when she was young?

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.600
Your mother was quite gentle
when she was young.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.000
It's indeed my lack of drive.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.350
I have to rely on her for everything.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.560
This... this... Gradually...

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.710
How could I just forget it?

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.800
Shaoguang,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.710
let's not talk about it.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.550
Just tell me

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.800
whether your mother

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.600
really wants to divorce me.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.960
If my mother really decides
to divorce you,

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.880
I will support her.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.520
How can you support her?

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.350
If you support her, you will lose me.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.000
But think about it.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.340
My mother has money now.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.680
Why is she still living here?

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.850
Why didn't she buy a big house

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.880
to live in?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.150
So what you mean is...

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.750
I still have a chance.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.830
That depends on you.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.410
You need to stay humble and grounded.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.150
Maybe her attitude can be changed.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.000
I can definitely stay humble
and grounded.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.880
By the way,

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.520
in a few days,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.390
the Culinary Master Competition
will be held.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.350
Can you bring her here?

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.750
Let her see that I'm not as lazy
as before.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:39.630
I have reflected.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.520
I have improved.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.150
Is it OK?

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.750
Do your best.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.920
Shaoguang,

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.330
you've done quite a lot of work.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.270
You... you are tired.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.440
You're tired.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:55.710
I'll handle

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.550
the whole job.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.600
You take a rest.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.500
(Li Fengxia divorces Shen Jianshe
today.)

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.440
What are you doing?

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.310
I...

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.940
I accidentally got lost.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.230
I accidentally walked into the study,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.480
accidentally came into this room,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.880
accidentally unlocked this lock

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.520
and then came in.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:44.590
Mr. Lin,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.960
my father said it would never happen.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.480
But there probably won't be a next time.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.990
Young Master.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.520
That Ms. Du you asked me to find,

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.480
the one who previously
deceived Mr. Shen.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.920
I did as you taught me.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.700
I told her

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.530
that she carries quite a lot
on her shoulders,

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.790
and it's all very subtle.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.120
To judge or not to judge,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.290
it's just a matter of a word.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:08.840
Sure enough,

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.440
she immediately agreed to help us

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.040
and dare not let any word slip.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.650
She trades in mansions,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.040
taking both open and secret routes,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.580
and has a wider network
of information.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.790
She should be able

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.040
to find out whether,
in Juxian Alley or elsewhere,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.000
anyone has rented a private warehouse.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.310
She actually mentioned someone,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.150
who is clearly involved
in the food business

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.880
yet possesses a warehouse that can store

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.400
a lot of military equipment.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.350
Who is it?

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.480
Yunlai Tavern.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:32.870
Lu Yun.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.150
Yunlai Tavern?

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.120
This Lu Yun

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.040
is very cautious.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.350
He found quite a few people.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.080
These warehouses are not under his name.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.990
It doesn't matter.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.310
Over time,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.960
there are always traces.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.830
Ms. Du

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.190
also asked me about Zhao Xunzhi
from the Hongwen Academy,

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.000
saying that he rented her house,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
but owed the rent.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.270
She said that previously Zhao Xunzhi

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.040
always liked to go to the Yunlai Tavern

00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.940
for a couple of drinks.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.440
One more thing.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.520
This is sent over

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.830
by Chancellor Meng before dinner.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.180
(On the Shangsi Festival, invite you
to join the Competition)

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.400
Is there something important?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.790
The Culinary Master Competition.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.500
Mr. Meng invites me to go together.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.190
His granddaughter will also participate.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.630
Well,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.960
better refuse.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.040
But Yunlai Tavern will also participate.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.190
We can take the opportunity

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.540
to see if any clues can be found.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.390
And...

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.270
Recently, my grandfather

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.560
has been busily making arrangements
for me.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.440
It's truly overwhelming.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.790
If you

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.670
can turn him down after this period,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.560
then I can take advantage of these days

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.520
to handle the matter properly.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.680
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.680
(One more drink in Yong'an)

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.680
(At that time, the most common
was grain-fermented wine.)

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.680
(Without distillation technology,
it can only be just over ten degrees,)

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.680
(about the same level
as today's wine or yellow wine.)

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.680
(The most popular turbid wine
had an even shorter brewing time,)

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.680
(sweeter taste,
and lower alcohol content.)

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.680
(By today's standards,
it would be considered 'sweet water'.)

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.040
(And my father actually got drunk
from drinking sweet water.)
