[Episode 24]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.260
That immortal from Zhushui Spiritual State

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.660
is quite loyal to you.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.570
He cares so much about you.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.290
Situ Ling and I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.570
did everything we could

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.100
to stabilize your condition.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.290
But I'm afraid that will not last for more than a month.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.450
It's all right.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.010
We have one month anyway.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.980
Situ Ling said

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.380
he had some connections in Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.890
And I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.220
will find some herbs at Mangfu Swamp

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.170
tomorrow.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.340
Worry not.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.450
I'm sure

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.610
I can find a cure in these vast Six Realms.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.890
Master,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.820
there's still hope for Twenty-Seven, right?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.780
Of course.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.170
Once a companion beast makes a pact with its master,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.340
they become one entity.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.570
Situ Ling

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.940
preserved a wisp of Twenty-Seven's divine consciousness.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.500
Once your spiritual veins and power return,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.450
so will he.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.690
Ming Yi.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.980
Ji Bozai does not

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.170
have the Golden Millet Dream at all?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.780
He had it.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.940
But he saw me stealing it,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.380
so he destroyed it before my eyes.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.410
Destroy it?

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.170
Why...

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.220
Why would he do that?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.730
It's your only hope to live.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.060
That jerk. I...

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.410
I could grab his neck now

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.890
and snap it.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.940
And you even lied to Situ Ling for him.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.540
Master.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.890
What's happened has happened.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.220
Besides, it was Ji Bozai's possession.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.980
He can do whatever he wants with it.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.820
If everyone knows he had the Golden Millet Dream,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.450
no one will believe that it is gone.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.780
Some people refuse to give up.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.060
Also, I let him down first.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.850
I don't want to trouble him again.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.820
Why did I take in a disciple like you?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.340
I...

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.020
I've heard that Ming Yi left

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.250
Wugui Sea.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.370
I will not pry into what happened

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.460
between you two.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.660
But most of the time,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.980
communication is the solution to a misunderstanding.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.580
Immortal Ji, I brought you here

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.980
to discuss something.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.540
Now that my uncle has passed,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.580
we should tie up any loose ends.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.730
What do you want to do next, Your Highness?

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.580
We must deal with Mu Qibai's subordinates.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.900
We can recruit those who wish to serve Jixing Abyss

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.460
with caution.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.850
And the rebels will be exiled

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.700
to the cold, harsh grounds.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.320
The netherbeast army was emboldened by the Blood Moon.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.660
Needless to say, the Emperor of Zhushui

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.230
is the mastermind.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.740
Given his ambition,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.100
he won't stop now.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.540
The Soul-Consuming Tree in the Dragon Carp Terrace

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.930
connects the Sunken Abyss and the divine capital.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.130
If they attack Jixing Abyss,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.620
an opening presents itself in the Sunken Abyss.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.220
Ah, you noticed it too.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.330
Immortal Ji,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.180
it seems like you already have a plan in mind.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.620
After Hou Zhao turned himself in,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.690
the Judgment Hall released the innocent prisoners from the Sunken Abyss.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.330
Other prisoners

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.930
were transferred elsewhere.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.860
However, knowing how unique the place is,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.060
it will always be a problem for us.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.300
I plan to withdraw all guards from the Sunken Abyss,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.890
seal the Soul-Consuming Tree,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.860
and then destroy the Sunken Abyss for good.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.180
As you wish, Immortal Ji.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.660
My Lord.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.740
My Lord, you hurt yourself

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.100
again and again to save Ming Yi.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.140
And this time, you even exposed your true identity

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.170
to save her.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.900
Is she worth it?

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.370
As long as she lives.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.370
My Lord!

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.540
Did you find anything

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.930
in Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.930
I bribed Chao Yu's former confidant

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.580
and found out the truth about what happened 22 years ago.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.050
We all believed

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.660
a sudden inferno in Zhangwei Mountain

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.780
killed everyone in the Bo clan.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.580
But in fact, it was His Majesty

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.020
who sent in a secret squad to raid the Bo's ancestral mansion

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.460
in Zhangwei Mountain.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.140
I knew it.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.020
Back then, they only found Part 1 of the Bo's Medical Classics,

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.220
which contains the method to fabricate the Heavenly Grief.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.850
However, the prescription of the Golden Millet Dream is incomplete.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.730
The Bo clan died in the fire.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.810
His Majesty gave Mu Qibai Part 1 of the documents

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.730
so that he could make the poison in the Sunken Abyss.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.780
But the rest of the classics are missing.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.660
His Majesty then gave Chao Yu a secret task

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.580
to hunt down the Bo sisters

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.980
to retrieve the rest of the classics.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.700
That said, it is still missing right now.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.100
A century ago,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.850
the Bo clan developed these dichotomous drugs

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.980
capable of giving spiritual veins to those who were born without one.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.020
The Six Realms fought for them

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.780
and many lost their lives.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.170
The Bos then destroyed all the drugs

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.930
and warned their descendants not to make them again.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.370
The Bo sisters are fugitives.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.900
They have probably hidden Part 2 of the classics

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.850
somewhere.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.900
After the Bo clan was gone,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.850
the patron deity, Zhulong, woke up in rage.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.130
It sealed the mountain and burned the forest.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.700
His Majesty had to retreat from Zhangwei Mountain.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.340
Since then, the Bo's ancestral mansion

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.220
has been kept inside an impenetrable barrier erected by Zhulong.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.770
It cannot be discovered.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.250
Only the Bo descendants can enter it.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.580
In that case,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.300
the best place to hide something

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.300
is the hidden Bo's ancestral mansion.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.130
Maybe

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.730
Part 2 of the classics is in Bo's ancestral mansion

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.060
now.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.250
And there's currently one descendant of the Bo clan

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.250
who can enter the barrier.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.250
Ji Bozai?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.180
I'll retrieve

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.940
Part 1 of the classics from the Sunken Abyss.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.100
My Lord.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.490
Mu Qibai has passed.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.980
Zhushui Spiritual State will be on high alert.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.730
If you take it away,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.100
His Majesty will find out.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.180
There's no time for this.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.730
Ji Bozai doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.530
I need to make a new one

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.980
so that Ming Yi can live.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.770
She won't bat an eye at you

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.130
even if you do this for her.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.850
One day,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.060
she'll fall for me.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.960
[A cloud of pear blossoms and a forlorn dream]

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.610
Are you sure, Immortal Situ?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.730
After the Emperor of Zhushui retreated,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.450
the patron deity, Zhulong, erected a barrier

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.970
and hid the Bo's ancestral mansion.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.780
If

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.420
they are still looking for Part 2,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.660
it means Part 2 still hasn't been found.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.780
We just have to get Part 1 from the Sunken Abyss,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.540
then find Part 2.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.570
Once we collect both,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.850
we might be able to make the Golden Millet Dream.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.810
I am the Chief of Judgment Hall.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.180
I have access to many things.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.210
And even if I am found out,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.570
I can find an excuse to protect myself.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.930
Ming Yi,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.380
I'll go to the Sunken Abyss for you.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.660
I can't burden you again, Immortal Situ.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.420
[A cloud of pear blossoms and a forlorn dream]

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.330
Ming Yi.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.210
Immortal Situ made you some scallion pancakes.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.090
Have some.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.260
Ming Yi.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.690
Ming Yi!

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.770
Immortal Situ!

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.980
Ming Yi is gone.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.250
Ming Yi.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.370
Master, Zhang Tai, Immortal Situ.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.610
I appreciate your hospitality all this time,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.650
but I cannot ask you to take more risks for me.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.700
I left to retrieve the classics.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.060
Forgive me.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.580
Immortal Situ.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.940
Can Immortal Situ find Ming Yi?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.890
Maybe I should inform Ji Bozai.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.260
[Ji...]

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.300
Ming Yi!

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.180
Ming Yi!

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.100
Ming Yi!

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.770
Ming Yi!

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.580
Twenty-Seven.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.650
Twenty-Seven.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.730
Twenty-Seven.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.180
No.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.530
Ming Yi!

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.890
Ming Yi!

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.370
Ming Yi!

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.100
Where are you, Ming Yi?

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.980
"Ming," as in "bright," like the moon in your heart,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.820
and "Yi," as in "feelings," like the deep ones I hold for you.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.650
You are the one

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.700
who's in a mess.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.460
My relationship with you

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.890
isn't ordinary.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.730
This sounds more like jealousy.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.580
My Lord!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.770
My Lord!

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.730
I brewed a lot of Golden Millet Dream

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.610
and brought a jar for you.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.730
You're the best, My Lord!

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.890
Thank you.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.610
Make me one more artifact.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.580
Show me.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.700
Come on. One more.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.610
There's no need for that.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.460
I really want to see it.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.650
Make me one more.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.220
Please.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.100
Okay.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.820
My Lord,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.820
it seems like you still care about me.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.220
I am rich now.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.300
I want to be your wife,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.820
your loyal, doting,

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.700
and legitimate wife.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.490
Get yourself together, Ji Bozai.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.580
♪Even if this life is like a shooting star♪

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.820
♪Brief only for the sake of meeting you♪

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.620
♪In this fleeting life, I'll still be your light♪

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.140
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.250
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.730
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.330
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:40.980
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.570
Twenty-Seven.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.860
Only a wisp

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.700
of your cat's divine consciousness is left.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.010
What happened?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.380
How come you're here?

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.330
Didn't you sever the heart imprint?

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.770
Zhang Tai told me to come.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.490
I won't trouble you again.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.940
Even if the Graft Spell backfires on you,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.940
there's no way you can be this weak.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.730
What's wrong?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.140
Nothing.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.860
Even if something's wrong,

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.980
it has nothing to do with you.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.010
Yes, that is true.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.570
I came to ask you one thing.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.530
In Xinliu's testimony,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.290
she mentioned Mu Qibai had a name list.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.140
Did you erase that?

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.770
So you found out.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.250
Yes.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.660
Moments ago.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.420
When I had Twenty-Seven investigate the netherbeast army,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.290
I told him to find the name list in the Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.250
He found nothing.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.180
I speculated

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.730
that either Mu Qibai found out

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.050
and destroyed it

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.490
or someone else took it away.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.660
Helping me was your excuse to approach me.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.770
Why should I trust you now?

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.730
Maybe you

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.220
have the name list.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.220
That's why you concealed this piece of information

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.860
from me.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.330
If I had the name list,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.010
I would have sufficient evidence

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.770
to know who from Yaoguang Mountain

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.730
got the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.810
I would strike back

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.900
and locate the villain

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.660
who poisoned Ming Xian.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.700
I wouldn't be here at all.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.620
Ming Xian was poisoned by the Heavenly Grief.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.050
So that's why you want the Golden Millet Dream.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.180
It's not because of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.420
Owning both the Golden Millet Dream and the Heavenly Grief

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.220
allows one to have spiritual veins

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.730
and ascend to the next cultivation stage.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.290
When that happens,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.010
Yaoguang Mountain can win

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.860
in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.330
It sounds enticing.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.770
But worry not, Immortal Ji.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.660
I am not that despicable yet.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.770
So why not return sooner?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.220
To Yaoguang Mountain?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.050
The Golden Millet Dream is destroyed.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.010
What's the point of going back?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.220
Watch as Ming Xian died from the pain of Heavenly Grief?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.250
He is prideful.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.620
He won't let anyone see him

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.380
when he's at his most vulnerable.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.180
So full of lies.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.260
Zhang Tai, Ming Yi is in...

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.290
- Zhang Tai. - You're finally awake.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.380
I was so scared.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.770
How did I come back?

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.330
I asked Immortal Ji to find you.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.490
After he found you,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.860
he wrote to me.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.980
Immortal Situ was looking for you too.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.940
I told him you'd be staying at my place.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.530
I also told him not to visit now

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.010
so that you could get more rest.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.050
When I was there,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.290
Immortal Ji was gone.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.980
You were unconscious

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.460
so I brought you back.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.330
What happened?

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.860
You were unconscious in the temple just now,

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.570
and you were so cold.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.810
Fortunately, someone injected some spiritual power into you.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.900
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.330
Ming Yi,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.180
I'm worried about you.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.330
What is happening?

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.900
I thought

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.220
you would tell me

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.700
when you recovered.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.560
But it's getting worse now.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.380
I...

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.090
Thank you, Zhang Tai.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.530
My life isn't worth anything.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.730
But you saved me

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.810
and care for me.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.420
If you know I've been lying to you,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.900
you will hate me forever.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.380
What are you on about?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.940
I will never hate you

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.090
even if you lie to me.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.770
You've been so kind to me.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.620
A few lies won't change my mind.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.010
I won't die just because you lied to me.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.380
And if someone hates you,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.620
that's because they are an idiot.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.940
Can't they see it's a white lie?

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.330
You...

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.010
So you are...

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.730
Ming Yi.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.530
How could it be? You are...

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.220
Oh, my.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.090
You were framed

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.620
and poisoned.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.810
And you only have one month to live.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.570
I...

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.180
What do we do now?

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.090
I'm sorry

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.620
for lying to you.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.180
Come on. This is a serious matter.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.700
You'll die if your identity is exposed.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.090
Of course, you have to hide it from everyone.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.460
So after knowing who I am, you still...

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.490
Do you think I'll...

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.420
Ming...

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.980
You can call me either name.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.530
Ming Yi.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.050
Jixing Abyss and Yaoguang Mountain are sworn enemies,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.860
but you are my friend.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:58.940
Of course,

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.010
if you want to attack Jixing Abyss,

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.730
I'll stop you.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.220
But you fought the netherbeasts and protected the people.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.900
You are a good person.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.700
Also, when I was in trouble,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.530
you came to help me.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.770
Now that you need my help,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.530
I won't leave you alone.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.940
Ming Yi, have hope.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.570
We'll find a way

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.570
to cure you within this month.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.620
Then, you go back to Yaoguang Mountain

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.900
and find that jerk

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.860
who poisoned you.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.380
Give him a good beating

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.490
so that he won't bully you again.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.180
Thank you, Zhang Tai.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.140
The tea gathering is in three months.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.180
Thanks to the help of Fairy Zhang Tai,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.140
our battle robe is ready

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.220
to be distributed.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.980
I wish you a swift victory

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.570
against Yaoguang Mountain.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.140
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.180
Meng Yangqiu is hardworking

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.090
and is improving daily.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.140
Yan Xiao is an excellent healer

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.660
who is great at supporting everyone.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.010
Chen Xi has trained for many days

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.210
and knows the divine armory the most.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.420
You should represent us

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.290
as the Forger.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.380
Can...

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.090
Can I do that?

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.140
Our rival, Ming Xian,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.250
became the youngest warrior

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.090
at the age of 13.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.010
You are 14 now.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.250
You are one year older than him when he was fighting.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.810
You will do fine.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.860
Show me your confidence.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.490
I don't have any right now.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.140
I shall lead the group.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.050
All of you have unique strengths.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.460
Amplify your strengths

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.900
and we may succeed.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.250
By a draw of lots,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.570
the tea gathering will be held in Yaoguang Mountain.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.730
This will be

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.620
the best opportunity to eliminate incumbent warriors.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.050
If we have fewer than three warriors,

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.570
we will be disqualified.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.730
Therefore, all of you are equally important.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.730
Make sure you are safe during training.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.940
As for the shortlisted candidates, train hard too

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.250
even though you are not attending the Qingyun Tournament.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.090
Zhushui Spiritual State will attack us again.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.620
We must work together

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.490
to protect Jixing Abyss with our lives.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.290
Protect Jixing Abyss with our lives!

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:28.700
Ming Yi!

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.900
I have bad news.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.010
There's a public notice on the Parade Bureau saying

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.620
that Yaoguang Mountain demoted Ming Xian to a criminal

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.810
due to his desertion.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.730
Lord Chengyun, Ming Xin, will be the new Crown Prince.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.900
Anything else on the notice?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.250
It says he will be

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.730
the warrior for now,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.530
and the conferment ceremony will be held later.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.770
I'm sure your father was forced to make this decision.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.860
The Qingyun Tournament is around the corner.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.900
The position of the warrior cannot be vacant.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.700
They had to elect a new one.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.180
He was forced to...

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.860
I know.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.570
I've gone missing for a while.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.140
The tea gathering is coming soon,

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.660
and Yaoguang Mountain has to make a statement.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.180
They can't drag this out forever.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.660
I understand why Father did

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.220
what he did.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.770
But nothing is set in stone yet.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.730
They merely announced the decision to all realms.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.290
The conferment ceremony hasn't been held,

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.860
which means that Father still doubts

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.250
Ming Xin's capability.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.330
He is not the Crown Prince

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.570
until the conferment ceremony is done.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.700
Once you are cured

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.940
and return to Yaoguang Mountain,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.530
I'm sure you'll find a way to put a stop to this.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.220
I won't let Ming Xin ruin Yaoguang Mountain.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.530
Ming Yi.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.140
Ming Yi. Just tell me.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.220
What do I have to do for you

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.860
to trust me?

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.220
Immortal Situ,

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.460
you treat me with kindness. You have saved me many times.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.940
Even though you are from Zhushui Spiritual State,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.140
I still trust you.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.770
But this is my problem.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.090
I don't want to trouble others.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.900
This is the complete map of the Sunken Abyss,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.330
including caverns that are concealed by spells.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.140
Bo's medical classics

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.860
might be hidden in these places.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.860
There might be traps in the caverns.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.660
So let's explore them together.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.730
You need help.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.250
Your master is not enough.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.010
I am already involved in this.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.010
I'm sure you know

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.250
it's better to trust me

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.010
than another outsider.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.660
The Emperor of Zhushui raised netherbeasts in the Sunken Abyss.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.010
Surprised that Mu Qibai harbored another plan,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.730
the Emperor used the blood moon

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.940
to drive the netherbeast army to frenzy,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.770
hoping to eliminate Jixing Abyss.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.140
At this point,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.940
unless we collude with Zhushui Spiritual State,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.460
a war

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.900
will be inevitable.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.010
You're saying...

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.290
Your Majesty, please pen a decree

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.010
that all warriors in Jixing Abyss

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.770
must train hard outside of the preparation

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.140
for the Qingyun Tournament

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.140
in case Zhushui Spiritual State attacks us.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.380
Zhushui Spiritual State is a powerful foe.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.570
Your Majesty,

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.810
concession

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.380
will only feed their arrogance.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.530
In the end, we will have none left.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.730
Yes, Father.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.010
Zhushui Spiritual State will not spare us.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.530
A war with Zhushui is inevitable.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.530
After the Prayer Night,

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.460
Yan Xiao and I went to Shouhua Academy and asked the warriors

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.090
what they would do if Zhushui Spiritual State attacked us.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.900
All of them,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.220
including the 14-year-old Chen Xi,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.050
said they were sick of coddling Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.490
Father,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.090
the victory against the netherbeast army has raised our morale.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.290
Everyone in Shouhua Academy

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.460
is willing to fight

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.290
for Jixing Abyss.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.220
All of you are too naive.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.570
The Emperor of Zhushui has lived for centuries.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.730
Who knows how many tricks he has?

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.140
If we fight them

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.660
and lose,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.380
what will happen to Jixing Abyss?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.420
But no one can decide

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.660
the fate of a person, a nation,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.290
or a world.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.530
To cower before the possibility of failure

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.570
is to set ourselves up

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.490
for failure.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.940
You'll think that failure is imminent.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.380
But that's cowardice.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.250
You don't

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.290
surrender to your fate.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.490
You write

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.980
your own fate.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.220
Indeed,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.330
the world needs young souls like you.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.490
I shall make it known that Tianji will act on my behalf

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.460
and lead the defense against Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.700
Everyone in Jixing Abyss shall unite.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.860
Invaders

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.530
will not be spared.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.940
- Yes, Father. - Yes, Your Majesty.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.300
[A cloud of pear blossoms and a forlorn dream]

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.260
Ming Yi.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.690
Are you all right?

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.490
I'm fine.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.780
Immortal Situ isn't here.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.980
The spiritual power I injected in you isn't helping.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.980
You can use your spiritual veins now,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.610
but that doesn't mean

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.900
you should exhaust them for me.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.460
Don't worry.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.740
I still have a month to live.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.340
Touch wood!

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.740
Don't give up, Ming Yi.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.050
We'll cure you within this month.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.270
- Don't worry. - Ming Yi.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.260
- Ming Yi, are you all right? - Master She.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.530
Please help Ming Yi.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.380
I'll brew more medicine.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.210
You never listen to me.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.780
Why must you leave?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.210
I only went out for a while.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.900
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.570
Look at you now.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.860
You think you can head to the Sunken Abyss alone?

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.210
Not alone.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.530
I'm planning to bring you with me.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.490
Do not use your spiritual veins anymore.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.460
Otherwise,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.210
you won't live past the next few days.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.090
Therefore,

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.780
I stayed up all night to make this crossbow.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.340
Master, inject your power into it

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.260
so that I can use it.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.610
No need to head to the Sunken Abyss.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.420
I'll go on your behalf.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.260
Master,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.170
we're going together.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.340
With you there,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.050
we'll breeze through the Sunken Abyss.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.940
You're done?

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.980
- You're the death of me. - Ow.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.980
It's filled to the brim.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.050
So this is the Sunken Abyss?

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.300
It doesn't look so special.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.900
Why did Father pick this place to raise netherbeasts

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.900
back then?

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.610
This place is full of miasma,

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.780
perfect for harvesting and storing Blood Pearl Bloom.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.860
Mu Qibai volunteered himself right then,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.380
so Father gave him

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.050
a chance to serve.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.380
Father also said

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.690
that once the Bo's medical classics were taken out of the Sunken Abyss,

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:10.900
the trap would be triggered.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.210
The Sunken Abyss would collapse right away,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.340
and the miasma would spread quickly thanks to the Soul-Consuming Tree.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.260
Now that we don't need anything

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.860
from Jixing Abyss anymore,

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.650
why don't we give them

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.260
a taste of miasma?

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.860
Then

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.530
allow me to stand guard next to the Soul-Consuming Tree

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.090
so that the tunnel will not be destroyed

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.300
while you descend to get the classics.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.490
I see you find yourself

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.980
a quick exit.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.210
It's only right to leave the important task to you, my dear brother,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.530
so that you can take credit for it before Father.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.380
Oh, the fiery phantom. Calm your mind

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.610
as I retrieve this item.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.130
Break!

Chao Yuan?

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.780
Father asked me to retrieve the medical classics.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.570
Are you here to help me

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.820
or to steal it from me?

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.380
Should I

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.860
hand you over to Father

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.860
or should I

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.260
kill you right away?

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.170
Situ Ling said

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.530
he'd come here to retrieve the medical classics.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.650
Where is he?

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.690
It's my problem.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.300
I don't want to be indebted to him.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.900
Ming Yi, let's split up and search.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:16.940
Be careful, Master.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.940
You too.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.740
My Lord,

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.090
I have scouted the place near Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.490
There is no other entrance.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.740
Only the Soul-Consuming Tree is connected to the Sunken Abyss.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.860
Tianji has already withdrawn

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.340
all the guards from the Sunken Abyss.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.740
And now,

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.820
we just need to seal the tree.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.090
What is this?

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.530
I'm not sure.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.860
But since it's so well hidden,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.980
it must have a use.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.650
Keep it first.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.380
We'll see after we seal the Soul-Consuming Tree.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.490

Found you.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.530
A fairy like you

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.380
trespassed into the Stoneheart Cavern of Sunken Abyss.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.130
Are you here for Bo's medical classics?

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.010
Who told you it's here?

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.300
I'm here to sweep the floor.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.340
Oh, you! You're early.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.940
So this is the medical classics?

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.610
Master She,

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.570
the miasma is somehow spreading.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.900
We need to find Ming Yi as soon as possible

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.570

You're right.

If you won't speak,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.010

the indelible brand of a criminal.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.010
Where should I brand you?

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.260
Your chest

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.780
or your pretty face?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.380
