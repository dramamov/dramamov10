[Episode 2]

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:08.053
I love the places where You are and where Your glory abounds.

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:13.409
Please do not take my soul along with sinners nor my life with murderers.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:18.801
Park Geon Ho targeted Lee Eun Hye from the start.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.148
Why do you think he killed her?

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:25.336
I'm sure we'll find the reason in Lee Dae Cheol.

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:30.903
Exactly, why take out a grudge against Lee Dae Cheol on his innocent daughter?

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:33.203
That bastard.

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:35.080
Be strong and courageous.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.543
Do not be afraid.

00:00:36.543 --> 00:00:38.517
Don't tremble in fear in front of them.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:46.560
For the Lord will be with you. He will never leave you or abandon you.

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.073
You still haven't identified the victim yet?

00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:09.895
No. Why?

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:12.833
Is this related to your case?

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:24.581
Let me see the face.

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:35.246
The face is badly decomposed.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:37.513
It will be difficult to tell who it is.

00:01:38.142 --> 00:01:40.514
Do you recognize her?

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:42.024
No.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.919
I was wrong.

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:50.829
This is not related to our case at all.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.635
It's too different from Lee Eun Hye's face I saw five years ago.

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:56.313
I'm sure she's changed a lot. It's been five years.

00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:59.166
No, I remember her face clearly.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.442
It's not her.

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:03.158
It's too different from the face we saw on the CCTV.

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:05.894
I think it will be hard to identify the face since she drowned.

00:02:05.894 --> 00:02:07.276
I know it's not her.

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.009
If I say it's not her, then it isn't her!

00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:20.291
Well, the clothes were different from what Lee Eun Hye was wearing on the CCTV.

00:02:22.057 --> 00:02:24.459
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.156
That's what I was about to say.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.106
It's not Lee Eun Hye.

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.127
People like you need to die.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:02.934
You're worse than a pig!

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:05.022
Die!

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:17.054
Please forgive me of my sins

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.164
and lead me to heaven.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.852
Please forgive me of my sins

00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:23.209
and lead me to heaven.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.727
Please forgive me of my sins

00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:27.314
and lead me to heaven.

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:29.029
Please forgive me of my sins

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.588
and lead me to heaven.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:41.883
Hey! You said you would be here a long time ago!

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:44.675
I was barely able to bring them with me!

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:47.032
Aren't they conscripted officers? What about the police squad?

00:03:47.032 --> 00:03:50.966
The whole police squad had to go to the rally in front of the city hall.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.539
So we only got one bus?

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.794
I think they can only come in the evening when the rally is over.

00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:59.305
So they'll be here tomorrow.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:03.839
Go wake them up. They're about to fall to the ground and sleep.

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.388
Hey, you punks!

00:04:05.388 --> 00:04:07.081
It's a murder case!

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.983
Damn, damn, dammit.

00:04:08.983 --> 00:04:11.703
Hurry up and bring the tools!

00:04:11.703 --> 00:04:13.881
What is Ji Man Goo doing over there by himself?

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:16.108
He said he didn't feel good and was looking for a bathroom earlier.

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:19.442
Are you saying that he's pooping at a place where a body is buried right now?

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:22.509
This is driving me insane. Are you pooping?

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.819
- Move it!
- It's cold!

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:30.142
Go to my car and see how many pairs of underwear are left in the trunk.

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:30.872
Why?

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:33.604
We should at least change our underwear if we can't shower.

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:37.319
Make sure he changes his too. So disgusting.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.716
If we're starting off like this, this is going to last at least 2 weeks.

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:43.114
Aigoo, my head...

00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:47.231
This is giving me a headache.

00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.235
- What about the body?
- We're looking for it right now.

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:52.539
Can't you take him there to locate it?

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.422
He said he was too out of it during the murder, so he can't remember.

00:04:56.422 --> 00:04:59.071
Has his confession stayed consistent?

00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:01.288
Well...

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:03.519
So he's going back and forth?

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.208
Yes.

00:05:06.616 --> 00:05:10.872
- Pull out the search team.
- Excuse me?

00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:14.915
There's a high possibility that Park Geon Ho is faking the whole thing.

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.233
Even so, the two of them were caught on CCTV─

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:20.123
If you confirm that he is not faking it,

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:22.886
you can search for the body then.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:29.271
You're right. Finding the body early doesn't do much for the investigation anyway.

00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:33.189
And make sure the reporters don't catch on to this.

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.819
This is a perfect case for them to bite on.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.282
It will be too much of a hassle.

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:40.515
Yes, sir. I will make sure that doesn't happen.

00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:45.188
We're not out here just digging a hole the size of a dot!

00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:47.475
Dig deeper!

00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:51.584
- Check this place too!
- Step on the shovel.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.900
- Dig deeper like that.
- Okay.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.680
Really get in there!

00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.327
What are you doing over there?

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:00.451
Sir?

00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:02.295
Think about it!

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.639
Do you think there would be reeds where he dug up the ground and buried a body?

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.308
Oh, the killer must've put the reeds back on top of the place

00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:11.719
where he buried the body like he was planting grass, huh?

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:12.820
- Oh.
- Oh?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.716
- You're right.
- "You're right"?

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:20.919
Yes, sir.

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.881
Of course we haven't found it yet.

00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:25.840

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.923
The conscripted officers were dispatched from the western division?

00:06:47.923 --> 00:06:48.664
Yes.

00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:50.306
But there's a rally. Did you look into that?

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:52.585
I've confirmed that they were dispatched, but they won't say why.

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:53.785
Really?

Where's Reporter Hong right now?

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:56.833
He's at the rally.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:57.805
Okay.

00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:01.209
Go to the west division when the rally is over. There must be something there.

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:02.837
Stay there today and tomorrow.

00:07:02.837 --> 00:07:04.848
Yes, Ma'am.

I read the article you wrote.

00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:46.637
Your articles have something that just draws people in.

00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:51.762
And I'm in here because people fell for your words.

00:07:52.795 --> 00:07:55.267
I don't personally harbor any feelings against you.

You're a very honest reporter. It's hard to find one these days.

You're wasting your time if you're trying to ask a favor from me.

Do you know Lee Dae Cheol?

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:39.545
I put him in prison as a death row convict when I was the head of the crime department.

00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:41.584
He's...

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:43.663
innocent.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.170
- You're back.
- Yeah.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.849
Did the other team get a case?

00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:55.302
I haven't seen much of them.

Two days ago, a guy turned himself in, saying that he killed Lee Dae Cheol's daughter.

- Lee Dae Cheol's daughter?
- Yes.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:04.640
They're probably running around trying to solve the case.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.140
Really?

Did the chief order it?

00:09:21.243 --> 00:09:24.195
Yeah, I think the chief thinks he's faking the whole thing.

00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:28.327
No, it's because there's something at stake for him.

00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:30.850
He's afraid of getting the blame.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.751
The chief? Why?

00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:37.117
When I arrested Lee Dae Cheol, the chief was the chief investigator.

00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:41.237
Imagine, if something had gone wrong in the investigation,

00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:43.134
he would have to take responsibility for it.

00:09:43.134 --> 00:09:44.750
So that's what this is about!

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.942
He... told you to watch out for the press, right?

00:09:47.942 --> 00:09:48.989
Yes, he did!

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.162
He's scared the press will find out that we dispatched a search team.

00:09:52.162 --> 00:09:55.553
He's manipulating us so that it doesn't hurt him.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.671
I see.

00:09:57.671 --> 00:10:00.443
Well, he's the one who gave the order.

00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:03.590
So I'm sure he'll take responsibility if something goes wrong.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.590
Let's see.

00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:22.312
A detective shouldn't wear a fake.

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:25.814
That brand is well beyond what you should be able to wear (financially).

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.316
Did you look into it?

00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:48.946
I don't know. I asked everyone, but no one knows.

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:50.849
Who did you ask?

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:52.073
Damn it.

00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:55.284
I don't know! Why do I have to tell you that?

00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:57.438
So annoying.

Hey.

00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.552
Okay, got it.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:11.852

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.836
Conditional meetings and illegal prostitution.

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:27.003
I'll get all the evidence if I look at your phone. Give it to me.

00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:30.295
Right now.

00:11:36.587 --> 00:11:39.070
I bought some clementines and put it on the dining table.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.953
Eat those and play your game for just one hour.

00:11:41.953 --> 00:11:44.620
I'll be back by the time you're done.

00:12:00.757 --> 00:12:02.423
Good work today.

00:12:02.423 --> 00:12:04.765
We're not puppies in training. Why did you make us run back and forth?

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.478
It was the chief's order. You understand how it goes.

00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:10.934
I think we need to do the search whether there's a body or not.

00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:13.063
I think your judgment was correct.

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:17.272
Shouldn't you just push it through, regardless of what the chief says?

00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:19.122
Yeah, but the chief—

00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:21.640
Hey, we need to let it go if that's what the chief wants.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.836
Dig if he says to dig. Bury it if he tells us to bury it.

00:12:23.836 --> 00:12:27.581
If he tells us to go die outside, then we just take our bodies outside and die there. Right?

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.773
The chief has a point. I only ordered it because I agree with him.

00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:34.167
So, what do we do now?

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:36.031
We don't need to go out there anymore, right?

00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:38.389
Then we need to let the police squad know.

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:40.283
They said they would come right after the rally was finished.

00:12:40.283 --> 00:12:41.086
Yeah, but—

00:12:41.086 --> 00:12:42.836
You need to hurry up and make your decision,

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:46.125
so we can decide whether we can rest or not.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.392
- We stayed up all night.
- You're right.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.654
But we don't know how things will proceed—

00:12:50.654 --> 00:12:52.520
Hurry up and call the chief!

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.003
Ask if you can send your dogs home.

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:59.847
Tell him that even dogs need food and rest before they can work.

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:02.463
Hey, don't worry about that.

00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:03.585
Just go rest.

00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:05.576
He's old-fashioned, so he's not going to change his order.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.195
Good work today. You should go home.

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:11.302
Why do we need to take orders from the chief who isn't even out in the field? Why?

00:13:11.302 --> 00:13:16.597
Hey, Ji Man Goo! You're in no position to be shouting at me!

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.242
Did you not get the call yet?

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:20.484
About what? I didn't get anything.

00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:24.381
What was the name of the guy you handed over a month ago for theft? Was it Bang Man Goo?

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:26.562
Park Joo Man. Man Goo is me.

00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:31.359
Yeah, Park Joo Man. He was released from prison.

00:13:32.382 --> 00:13:34.756
Why? I'm sure he's the one!

00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:37.430
The Jungbu Police Station caught the real culprit!

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.255
You said you got Park Joo Man's confession.

00:13:40.255 --> 00:13:42.040
You said the evidence was clear!

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.505
What confession and evidence did you get?

00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:48.858
No, I'm sure it's Park Joo Man!

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:50.606
Hey, you should go home.

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:53.675
You should avoid this place. Go!

00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:55.452
I'm going to go home then.

00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:57.750
I don't feel good.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.765
- See you later.
- Hey, Ji Man Goo!

00:13:59.765 --> 00:14:01.832
Aigoo, you got here fast.

00:14:01.832 --> 00:14:04.265
What's going on, Park Joo Man?

00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:05.669
What are you doing?

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:07.934
Hey! Wait until he gets a few more punches in.

00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:10.463
I told you it wasn't me!

00:14:10.463 --> 00:14:12.763
Another one?

00:14:12.763 --> 00:14:16.127
What are you going to do now?

00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:20.355
You've destroyed an innocent man's life! What are you going to do about it, you bastard?

00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:22.214
- Stop it.
- Please calm down!

00:14:22.214 --> 00:14:24.396
- Let go!
- Okay, calm down.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:26.179
How can I calm down?

00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:29.675
I clearly told you that it wasn't me!

00:14:29.675 --> 00:14:33.059
But he kept saying it was me! That it had to be me!

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:34.899
What are you going to do about this?

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:36.996
Give me back my life!

00:14:36.996 --> 00:14:38.287
Let's talk outside!

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:39.412
Let go!

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:41.249
Ji Man Goo! You come out too!

00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:43.436
Let go of me!

00:14:45.054 --> 00:14:46.265
What are you waiting for?

00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:48.598
Hurry up and go beg on your knees.

00:14:48.598 --> 00:14:51.141
Okay, I'm going!

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:57.225
- Did you film it?
- I'm not going to share it.

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:58.788
- Delete it.
- I don't want to.

00:14:58.788 --> 00:14:59.873
I said, delete it.

00:14:59.873 --> 00:15:01.460
I'm going to save it for myself. It's funny.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.185
- Your face is funnier.
- No, your face is funnier.

00:15:04.185 --> 00:15:05.476
You're the funniest looking on.

00:15:05.476 --> 00:15:07.327
Go shave. Your face is funnier.

00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:08.495
Your breath stinks.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:11.146
- Are you sure you're detectives? You're just a bunch of gangsters.
- You're the gangster.

00:15:11.146 --> 00:15:13.193
Your breath stinks more.

00:15:13.193 --> 00:15:14.281
Do you have a death wish?

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.017
Go ahead and kill me! I'll just arrest you.

00:15:16.017 --> 00:15:17.917
Team Leader Nam.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.530
- Detective Choi.
- Yes?

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.831
Just delete it.

00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:25.128
What's the point of saving it? It's humiliating for us.

00:15:25.128 --> 00:15:27.147
Yes, sir.

00:15:27.147 --> 00:15:28.902
I deleted it.

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.258
You should go shave.

00:15:32.258 --> 00:15:34.829
Team Leader Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.874
We need to talk.

00:15:40.226 --> 00:15:42.726
You know Detective Choi is immature.

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:44.802
It was just a joke.

00:15:44.802 --> 00:15:46.348
This isn't about that.

00:15:46.348 --> 00:15:50.906
About Lee Dae Cheol's case from five years ago...

00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:52.391
What about it?

00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:56.845
I know I am the one who arrested Lee Dae Cheol and handed him over.

00:15:56.845 --> 00:16:01.726
But honestly, I wrapped up the case based on the investigation reports that you gave me.

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.492
What about it?

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:05.662
Is that bothering you now?

00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:07.011
You didn't complain back then.

00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:11.030
Well, I checked it and didn't find any problems,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.550
so I wrapped up the case based on what you gave me.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.206
I'm not saying this because I have a complaint.

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:23.584
I just wanted to ask about your personal opinion.

00:16:24.497 --> 00:16:29.927
Did anything bother you when you were investigating the case, by any chance?

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.998
Is there anything you missed or─

00:16:31.998 --> 00:16:33.991
No.

00:16:33.991 --> 00:16:35.738
Nothing.

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:37.840
Really?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.319
You're a very detailed person.

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:43.184
Why? Is this because Lee Dae Cheol's daughter has suddenly gone missing?

00:16:43.184 --> 00:16:44.469
Is that why you're bringing this up?

00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:49.414
You remembered that Lee Eun Hye is Lee Dae Cheol's daughter?

00:16:49.414 --> 00:16:50.889
Of course, I had forgotten.

00:16:50.913 --> 00:16:53.533
I only remembered it after Detective Choi told me.

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:57.599
Anyway, there won't be any problems, right?

00:16:59.349 --> 00:17:02.333
There won't be any problems as long as you don't get played by Park Geon Ho.

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:04.888
Don't worry about that. That will never happen.

00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:07.208
No matter what anyone else thinks,

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:10.166
just believe in yourself.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.572
That's all.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:16.402
Yeah. Of course, I believe in myself.

00:17:17.247 --> 00:17:19.520
Jerk...

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:27.020
[Brit Motel]

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.352
Hello?

00:17:34.352 --> 00:17:35.430
Ah, Park Hong Doo?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.420
Yes. Who is this?

00:17:37.427 --> 00:17:40.414
I'm Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West Police Department.

00:17:42.302 --> 00:17:43.935
Nice to meet you.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.490
Hong Doo.

00:17:59.994 --> 00:18:02.778
Hong Doo!

00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:05.110
Hey you punk!

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.190
Hong Doo!

00:18:12.199 --> 00:18:14.708
Hey, you bastard!

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.620
Bastard!

00:18:57.458 --> 00:19:00.328
Aigoo, Hong Doo.

00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:12.973
What are you doing?

00:19:12.973 --> 00:19:15.997
Proof that you pulled out the knife first.

00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:20.245
In other words,

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:26.950
there won't be any issues even if I kill you right now.

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.186
I'm a police officer.

00:19:39.186 --> 00:19:40.992
Sorry.

00:19:41.778 --> 00:19:46.281
Hey, you shouldn't pull a knife on a police officer.

00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:48.480
You can end up dead.

00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:51.632
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:58.854
The last text you received was three days ago?

00:19:58.854 --> 00:20:02.964
Yes, I haven't been able to reach her since then because her phone is off.

00:20:02.964 --> 00:20:05.800
"Don't look for me. I'm going to disappear."

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.225
That means she knew she would go missing.

00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.611
Go.

00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:14.676
- What?
- I said, go.

00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:16.889
Oh, okay.

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:18.719
Hey.

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.277
Yes, sir?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.165
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:25.810
You better answer my calls,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.921
- or we'll have to see each other again.
- Okay, sir.

00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:31.333
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.000
Oh, right.

00:20:36.364 --> 00:20:40.064
Hey. Did the results come back?

00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:42.552
Really?

00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:44.140
Thank you.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.885
Bye.

00:20:46.442 --> 00:20:47.850
It's not Lee Eun Hye.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.351
They found a suicide note and belongings nearby.

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.990
It's definitely not Lee Eun Hye.

00:20:57.128 --> 00:20:58.936
Hyeongnim.

00:20:58.936 --> 00:21:02.262
Park Geon Ho gave me a tip yesterday.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.062
A tip?

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:05.362
"You snakes.

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:07.118
You brood of vipers.

00:21:07.118 --> 00:21:09.598
How will you escape being condemned to hell?"

00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:11.106
What are you talking about?

00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:14.686
Who do you think the brood of vipers is?

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:16.998
- Lee Eun Hye?
- What if it's not her?

00:21:16.998 --> 00:21:18.298
Then who?

00:21:18.298 --> 00:21:19.872
You.

00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:29.281
What a cunning bastard.

00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:31.403
How did you come up with that?

00:21:31.403 --> 00:21:34.603
You've got a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

00:21:34.603 --> 00:21:36.896
You killed Lee Eun Hye in the field of reeds?

00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:39.062
That's all a lie, huh?

00:21:39.062 --> 00:21:43.067
We found Lee Eun Hye's body this morning!

00:21:44.075 --> 00:21:46.561
Hey! Hey, hey!

00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:48.564
I know what you're thinking.

00:21:48.564 --> 00:21:53.169
You got yourself on the CCTV in the reed field with Lee Eun Hye on purpose, huh?

00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:58.802
Because it will serve as your alibi when Lee Eun Hye's body is found somewhere else.

00:21:58.802 --> 00:22:00.530
What are you talking about right now?

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.692
Just what did she do wrong for you to murder her so brutally?

00:22:03.692 --> 00:22:05.248
Detective.

00:22:05.248 --> 00:22:09.293
Speak slowly. What nonsense are you spewing right now?

00:22:09.293 --> 00:22:13.976
We found Lee Eun Hye's body on the beach, you bastard!

00:22:13.976 --> 00:22:16.779
And you're about to say that you didn't kill her?

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:20.088
You're the one who said you killed her!

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:23.917
You said you killed her with your own hands, you bastard!

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.892
You found her body on the beach?

00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:28.814
- Hyeongnim.
- What?

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.742
I just got a call.

00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:35.048
They found belongings and a suicide note nearby. I think it was a suicide.

00:22:35.048 --> 00:22:37.795
No, this bastard killed her.

00:22:39.863 --> 00:22:41.029
Tell me the truth.

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:42.927
You made it look like a suicide, huh?

00:22:42.927 --> 00:22:45.208
You killed her and threw her into the ocean, huh?

00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:48.019
And you said you killed her in the field to cover that up!

00:22:48.019 --> 00:22:49.344
Why did you kill her?

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.075
Why did you kill her?

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:53.357
Tell my why, you bastard?

00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:55.354
- Why?
- That's enough!

00:22:55.354 --> 00:22:56.287
Hyeongnim!

00:22:56.311 --> 00:22:59.511
Hey! You won't be able to get out of this.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.976
I'm going to lock you up myself.

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:04.076
- Let's go outside.
- Let go!

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:05.658
Let go of me, you punk!

00:23:05.658 --> 00:23:08.654
Stop stepping out of your line just because you graduated at the top of your class.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:11.436
You're not supposed to investigate with your head!

00:23:11.436 --> 00:23:13.097
Okay.

00:23:13.097 --> 00:23:15.434
Let's just go outside!

00:23:20.574 --> 00:23:23.540
I don't know why he's using violence.

00:23:24.114 --> 00:23:26.848
They said it was suicide, not murder.

00:23:31.263 --> 00:23:35.406
You planned this with Lee Eun Hye, right?

00:23:35.406 --> 00:23:38.815
"I'll go put on a show at the police department.

00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:42.959
So you stay hidden as if you were dead."

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:46.294
But Lee Eun Hye had something else planned.

00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:52.211
She wanted your show to become real.

00:23:53.065 --> 00:23:56.443
The show has turned into a tragedy.

00:24:08.763 --> 00:24:11.496
I didn't graduate at the top of my class.

00:24:12.028 --> 00:24:13.528
I know.

00:24:13.528 --> 00:24:17.300
The whole school would be doomed if you were at the top of your class.

00:24:18.738 --> 00:24:20.665
You're psycho.

00:24:56.216 --> 00:25:01.592
No matter how I think about it, it feels like I'm getting played by you guys.

00:25:02.386 --> 00:25:04.793
I don't think I'll be able to handle it by myself.

00:25:04.793 --> 00:25:06.967
Get me a lawyer.

00:25:07.692 --> 00:25:09.392
A lawyer?

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.367
Okay, I'll get a public defender.

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:17.295
No. I need a lawyer that I know.

00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:19.194
Bring me my phone.

00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:21.742
His number is in my phone.

00:25:25.254 --> 00:25:26.903
Wait.

00:25:29.864 --> 00:25:31.964
What is he plotting now?

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:35.809
What he needs is his phone, not a lawyer.

00:25:35.809 --> 00:25:38.989
I'm sure he prepared a way to talk to Lee Eun Hye.

00:25:38.989 --> 00:25:42.937
Please contact Lee Eun Hye.

00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.819
Please.

00:25:45.403 --> 00:25:48.303
Contact Lee Eun Hye who is alive.

00:26:20.022 --> 00:26:21.922
It's fine.

00:26:21.922 --> 00:26:24.246
- You can take it.
- Why?

00:26:24.246 --> 00:26:27.097
You said you were going to call a lawyer.

00:26:27.097 --> 00:26:32.267
Have you ever killed someone?

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:37.053
Do you know what it feels like in your hands when you're

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:39.316
choking someone who is flailing around to stay alive?

00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:42.033
Guess.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:46.863
If you get it right, I'll play along with what you've planned.

00:26:46.863 --> 00:26:49.302
You really killed Lee Eun Hye—

00:26:49.302 --> 00:26:50.906
Stop with the crappy leading questions.

00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:53.734
Do a better job if you want to paint me as a murderer!

00:26:53.734 --> 00:26:55.405
You people are good at that.

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.428
What?

00:26:56.428 --> 00:27:00.254
Can you feel that I'm a murderer?

00:27:00.254 --> 00:27:03.473
Do you see me as a murderer?

00:27:03.473 --> 00:27:05.734
Then turn me into a murderer.

00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:07.647
Say, "You're a murderer!"

00:27:07.647 --> 00:27:11.712
"You're a murderer!"

00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:14.075
Say it.

00:27:21.002 --> 00:27:24.981
[He was sentenced to death, but... The nightmare isn't over for the bereaved families]

00:27:25.512 --> 00:27:28.913
The tone is totally different! It's as if I'm protecting the convict!

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:30.787
It was an interview with the victims' families.

00:27:30.787 --> 00:27:32.246
The conclusion is the same, no matter how you write it.

00:27:32.246 --> 00:27:36.904
No, I stayed as objective as I could be when I wrote the article.

00:27:36.904 --> 00:27:39.776
As objective as you could be?

00:27:39.776 --> 00:27:42.592
Why are you so naive?

00:27:42.592 --> 00:27:45.240
Like how a company has an owner, the press has its tone.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.556
Senior Manager, then let me just ask one question.

00:27:48.556 --> 00:27:52.542
Is this article reflecting the tone of the press or your own opinion?

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:54.355
- That's enough.
- Senior Manager.

00:27:54.355 --> 00:27:55.493
Anyway, you did a good job.

00:27:55.493 --> 00:27:58.118
The director wanted to meet with you after seeing the article.

00:27:58.118 --> 00:28:00.964
- I'll call you when we set up a date.
- Senior Manager!

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.270
[He was sentenced to death, but... The nightmare isn't over for the bereaved families]

00:28:09.842 --> 00:28:12.075
Lee Dae Cheol isn't the real killer.

00:28:12.075 --> 00:28:14.198
He was just turned into one.

00:28:14.198 --> 00:28:19.167
A collaborative effort between the detectives, prosecutors, and the judge.

00:28:19.167 --> 00:28:23.934
And the last finishing touch was done by you.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.720
[He was sentenced to death, but... The nightmare isn't over for the bereaved families]

00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:53.942
(Credit card transaction alerts)

00:29:09.311 --> 00:29:11.492
This is Kang Do Chang of the Incheon West Police Department.

00:29:11.492 --> 00:29:14.372
Oh, Detective Kang, this is Jin Seo Kyeong from Jeonghan Daily.

00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:15.946
Hey, Reporter Jin. What's up?

00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:18.350
You remember Lee Dae Cheol's case from five years ago, right?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.399
What?

00:29:19.399 --> 00:29:22.301
You were in charge of the case, right?

00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:25.268
And your team was the one who arrested him.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:39.043
But, why are you bringing up a case from five years ago out of the blue?

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.967
Hello!

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.454
Long time no see, Reporter Jin.

00:29:45.301 --> 00:29:46.996
Detective Kang, you're here too.

00:29:46.996 --> 00:29:49.120
How have you been?

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.817
This must be a private matter.

00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:53.350
Yeah, I had a favor to ask of him.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.520
Oh, then I shouldn't be here, right?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.604
Sorry.

00:29:58.604 --> 00:29:59.853
Okay, got it.

00:29:59.853 --> 00:30:03.090
Please talk comfortably.

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:06.787
Hi, it's me.

00:30:06.787 --> 00:30:10.332
Jeonghan Daily's reporter is talking to the Incheon West Police Department.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.143
Have there been any prosecution case reports for this department?

00:30:16.786 --> 00:30:18.486
No.

00:30:20.114 --> 00:30:22.314
I just got a feeling.

00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:25.742
Let me be direct.

00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:29.122
Are you confident that Lee Dae Cheol is the real killer?

00:30:29.122 --> 00:30:31.660
Why are you asking me that?

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.001
I asked the question first.

00:30:35.005 --> 00:30:37.571
Of course, I'm sure.

00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:40.429
Now it's your turn to answer the question.

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:44.239
There was a report claiming Lee Dae Cheol's innocence.

00:30:44.239 --> 00:30:46.439
What? From whom?

00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:49.495
I can't reveal the source yet.

00:30:50.637 --> 00:30:54.204
I'm sorry, but a reporter can't be in here.

00:30:54.204 --> 00:30:58.021
I'm here because I heard a report of a violation of human rights inside the holding cell.

00:30:58.021 --> 00:30:59.145
Excuse me?

00:30:59.145 --> 00:31:01.253
What are you talking about?

00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:04.374
Who reported it?
[Detainee Status]

00:31:04.374 --> 00:31:07.976
I saw it on the community board of the police department's website.

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:11.720
- You can go ahead and check.
- What? There's no way.

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.654
- Mr. Park Geon Hoo?
- Yes.

00:31:19.654 --> 00:31:21.432
Why are you locked up in here?

00:31:21.432 --> 00:31:23.795
I killed someone.

00:31:23.795 --> 00:31:26.109
- What?
- I killed a girl.

00:31:26.109 --> 00:31:28.602
An 18-year-old girl.

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.862
And?

00:31:30.862 --> 00:31:32.653
I buried her.

00:31:32.653 --> 00:31:34.053
What?

00:31:34.053 --> 00:31:35.360
What do you think you're doing?

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.935
Hold on, let me talk to him.

00:31:36.935 --> 00:31:39.123
Get out of here. You can't be talking to him.

00:31:39.123 --> 00:31:40.509
Please leave!

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:42.299
Out.

00:31:50.692 --> 00:31:54.092
Reporter Jin. I have enough on my plate as it is.

00:31:54.092 --> 00:31:56.637
I have no time to ponder an old case.

00:31:56.637 --> 00:31:59.310
You said you're sure, so there's no reason for you not to cooperate.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.231
Then submit an official request for cooperation!

00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:04.531
I have nothing more to say.

00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:07.639
I understand.

00:32:07.639 --> 00:32:10.177
I'm planning on writing the article no matter what.

00:32:10.177 --> 00:32:12.402
Write about what? Nothing has been confirmed.

00:32:12.402 --> 00:32:15.548
The source who claims his innocence is pretty credible.

00:32:15.548 --> 00:32:17.278
It's enough for an article.

00:32:17.278 --> 00:32:19.545
- See you later.
- Wait.

00:32:19.545 --> 00:32:22.107
Hold on a second!

00:32:25.106 --> 00:32:29.013
It's a sensitive time right now, so can you hold off on the article until later?

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:32.395
It will complicate things if you write the article.

00:32:32.395 --> 00:32:34.762
It's a sensitive time?

00:32:34.762 --> 00:32:37.564
Why? Why will it complicate things?

00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:39.725
Who's the source?

00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:45.002
Kim Gi Tae, the former District Attorney General.

00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:47.019
Why would he say that?

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:48.091
What's it based on?

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:51.372
He was the head of the crime department at the time.

00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:55.527
Don't you think he's a pretty credible source?

00:32:56.825 --> 00:32:59.917
All right, your turn now.

00:33:04.267 --> 00:33:10.414
Last night, we got a report that Lee Dae Cheol's daughter, Lee Eun Hye, had gone missing.

00:33:10.414 --> 00:33:14.307
A man who claims he killed and buried her turned himself in.

00:33:14.307 --> 00:33:18.044
But we haven't yet confirmed if she's alive or not.

00:33:18.044 --> 00:33:21.793
This article will put things at risk.

00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:23.915
It's not a coincidence, huh?

00:33:24.715 --> 00:33:27.942
I really wish it was a coincidence.

00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:58.200
She's so pretty...

00:33:59.935 --> 00:34:01.723
My sister.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.769
[Yoo Jeong Seon]

00:34:11.771 --> 00:34:16.239
I saw the interview with the victims' families this morning.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.600
It was pretty persuasive. Who wrote it?

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.256
Her name is Jin Seo Kyeong. She's a pretty smart girl.

00:34:24.763 --> 00:34:28.369
The president pledged to get rid of the death sentence.

00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:32.174
Be careful. The Blue House might not be happy about it.

00:34:32.174 --> 00:34:33.794
I think they'll actually like it.

00:34:33.794 --> 00:34:37.023
You have to get rid of the trash in order to lay a new road.

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:46.983
The cabinet reshuffling will be announced soon.

00:34:46.983 --> 00:34:48.775
You mean the Attorney General?

00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:50.632
Congrats.

00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:54.492
It's too early to celebrate. There will be a lot of talk at the hearing.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:57.546
Don't worry, I'll take care of the press.

00:34:58.105 --> 00:34:59.605
Okay.

00:35:03.497 --> 00:35:07.529
[Evangelist kills and buries body of female high school student]

00:35:07.529 --> 00:35:11.303
I told you to keep it quiet!

00:35:11.303 --> 00:35:13.083
Who was it?

00:35:13.083 --> 00:35:14.880
Which crazy bastard did this?

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.436
I'll report to you after I look into it a bit more, sir.

00:35:20.488 --> 00:35:22.355
Who did this?

00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:25.442
Our team is the only one who knows about this!

00:35:25.442 --> 00:35:28.264
It will only make things harder for us, so why would we leak it?

00:35:28.264 --> 00:35:29.830
No reporters came to you?

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.748
No. Even if they did, I wouldn't talk to them.

00:35:31.748 --> 00:35:33.930
Damn it, who did this?

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:38.158
Just wait until I catch this bastard!

00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:41.321
Damn it!

00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:45.357
Oh right, I did meet with a reporter.

00:35:45.357 --> 00:35:49.961
And I fell for her tricks and told her everything. Happy?

00:35:49.961 --> 00:35:52.595
Isn't your phone ringing?

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.127
What do you want? I'm busy.

00:36:01.127 --> 00:36:02.213
What?

00:36:02.213 --> 00:36:04.414
I gave you the card this morning.

00:36:04.414 --> 00:36:09.836
You can pay for deliveries with a card these days, and you better not use it on unnecessary things.

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:12.846
I get texts every time you use the card. Got it?

00:36:12.846 --> 00:36:14.246
Bye.

00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:18.631
This is pissing me off the more I think about it.

00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:20.541
Who does she think she is?

00:36:20.541 --> 00:36:24.008
She's mooching off of me after the divorce.

00:36:24.008 --> 00:36:27.680
She never fails to irritate me just when I start to forget about her.

00:36:31.143 --> 00:36:34.476
Park Geon Ho gave Lee Eun Hye his card.

00:36:34.476 --> 00:36:39.299
He checked his credit card text alerts and knew that Lee Eun Hye is alive.

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:43.604
But there's no proof that Lee Eun Hye is the one who used the card.

00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:46.101
The places where it was used are places that high school girls go to.

00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:48.162
Fast food restaurants, internet cafés, convenience stores.

00:36:48.162 --> 00:36:50.245
It could be his sister or his girlfriend.

00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:51.912
Park Geon Ho is an orphan.

00:36:51.912 --> 00:36:53.971
And the card was used at a motel too.

00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:56.534
No girl would use her boyfriend's card to pay for a motel.

00:36:56.534 --> 00:36:58.081
Let's go to the motel first.

00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:03.181
They must remember her face if a high school girl went to a motel by herself.

00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:06.398
- Are you the one who talked to the reporter?
- No.

00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:10.031
Then why would there be an article saying that you killed and buried a girl?

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.347
I said I did it!

00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:14.017
I killed someone!

00:37:14.017 --> 00:37:15.351
That's what matters.

00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:18.158
Do I have to take responsibility for a reporter too?

00:37:18.158 --> 00:37:20.953
Why should I? Why?

00:37:31.281 --> 00:37:34.470
He brought in the press on purpose.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.316
Make sure he doesn't get in front of the reporters no matter what. Got it?

00:37:37.316 --> 00:37:38.840
Yes, sir.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.387
Please excuse me.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.879
Yes, sir.

00:37:42.879 --> 00:37:44.908
We weren't trying to hide it on purpose.

00:37:44.908 --> 00:37:46.885
Hello? Prosecutor?

00:37:46.885 --> 00:37:48.526
What did he say?

00:37:48.526 --> 00:37:50.111
He's really pissed.

00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:53.900
He's furious that he had to read about the case he's in charge of in the press.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.071
He wants us to hand Park Geon Ho over to the prosecution right now.

00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:57.971
Damn it.

00:37:59.494 --> 00:38:01.827
- It hasn't been 48 hours yet, right?
- No, sir.

00:38:01.827 --> 00:38:04.179
Keep him in there until then.

00:38:04.179 --> 00:38:07.881
- And send out the search team again.
- What?

00:38:07.881 --> 00:38:11.511
Imagine if he really did bury her and we're doing nothing about it.

00:38:11.511 --> 00:38:13.947
Are you going to take responsibility for that?

00:38:13.947 --> 00:38:15.571
You're right.

00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:22.398
But... send them to a different place than the one Park Geon Ho has mentioned.

00:38:22.398 --> 00:38:23.294
What?

00:38:23.294 --> 00:38:28.527
The place Park Geon Ho mentioned is where Lee Dae Cheol killed and buried Jang Jin Soo.

00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:31.954
There should be at least one reporter who remembers that case.

00:38:31.978 --> 00:38:33.425
What do you think will happen then?

00:38:33.425 --> 00:38:36.470
They'll catch on to the fact that this case is related to Lee Dae Cheol.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.586
Right?

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.010
Yes, sir.

00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:44.677
This is the location reported to be where Park killed and buried a high school student.

00:38:44.677 --> 00:38:50.214
Currently, more than 200 officers of the search team are here looking for the body.

00:38:51.541 --> 00:38:53.241
Dong Wook!

00:38:53.767 --> 00:38:57.134
Go to the front and tell them to slow down.

00:38:57.134 --> 00:39:00.399
There's no need to exhaust energy from the start. Hurry!

00:39:00.399 --> 00:39:01.723
Let's slow down!

00:39:01.723 --> 00:39:03.847
- Run!
- Slow down.

00:39:03.847 --> 00:39:06.765
We should've picked flat ground for this show.

00:39:06.765 --> 00:39:09.626
This is exhausting!

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.235
An unmanned hotel?

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.080
Ji Hyeok.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.680
There's a CCTV.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.294
They'll only let us check it if we have a warrant.

00:39:22.294 --> 00:39:24.927
Let's check the other places first.

00:39:25.868 --> 00:39:27.303
Think carefully.

00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:31.902
She bought a hamburger here yesterday and paid with a card.

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:35.339
I'm not sure. As you can see...

There's really a chance that Lee Eun Hye might be alive?

00:40:36.173 --> 00:40:38.464
- Give me that.
- Yes, sir.

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:40.949
What do you mean?

00:40:40.949 --> 00:40:42.602
Lee Eun Hye is alive?

00:40:42.602 --> 00:40:44.368
It's not for sure yet.

00:40:44.368 --> 00:40:46.639
But there is a chance.

00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:48.081
Yes, sir.

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:49.934
Yes, understood.

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:53.070
We'll try to find her as quickly as possible.

00:40:57.377 --> 00:40:59.710
He's going to pester me all day.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.911
We have no other choice but to check the CCTV ourselves to confirm.

00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:06.111
Seeing her on a monitor won't do us any good.

00:41:06.111 --> 00:41:09.620
We have to actually find her.

00:41:45.791 --> 00:41:48.690
I stayed up three nights in a row,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:54.668
so I have no idea what I'm eating or what I'm doing right now.

00:41:54.668 --> 00:41:56.506
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

00:41:56.506 --> 00:41:59.229
Look at you doing hard labor as soon as you arrive.

00:41:59.229 --> 00:42:02.615
Why are you putting yourself through this?

You can get a better job with your resume.

00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:08.194
I went to the police university because it was free.

00:42:08.194 --> 00:42:11.368
And this was the only place left after I took out all the places I didn't want to join.

00:42:11.368 --> 00:42:13.797
And I stayed because it suits me.

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:17.801
Right, thank you so much for that half-hearted answer.

00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:26.753
Yes, sir.

Yes, we're running around everywhere looking for her, so please give us some time.

We're searching all of Incheon for her.

Yes, sir. Yes.

00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:41.249
He should come out here himself if he's so frustrated.

00:42:41.249 --> 00:42:44.181
You can tell he became the chief with talk.

00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:47.438
He tries to solve everything with his mouth.

Where?

00:42:55.775 --> 00:42:57.375
Here.

00:43:02.486 --> 00:43:04.086
It's a guy.

00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:05.979
Doesn't that mean someone else was using it?

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:07.918
- He bought alcohol and cigarettes.
- And?

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:11.309

- What?

Whose card did you just use? Lee Eun Hye gave it to you, right?

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.764
Who's Lee Eun Hye?

00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:43.548

No one would listen to the truth, no matter how many times I said it.

00:45:32.426 --> 00:45:36.370
