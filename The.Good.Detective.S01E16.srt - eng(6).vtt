You have a scrape on your neck.

00:01:29.462 --> 00:01:31.695
There must've been a scuffle.

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:36.090
It looks like I can't get out of this one.

00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:42.315
How did you guys end up appearing at such a critical time?

He called you guys, huh?

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.216
What a clever jerk he is.

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:53.087
He planned this to make me a murderer.

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:57.250
Be honest. You've caught on to it, huh?

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.090

[Incheon West Police Station]

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:09.108
The forensics team has performed an autopsy on the victim.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:11.527
The DNA found under the victim's nails and on his clothes

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:15.820
was a match for the suspect who was arrested on the scene.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.276
Has the suspect made a confession?

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:19.837
We have not obtained his confession yet.

00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:22.064
So the police are certain that it was a murder?

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:26.040
I cannot confirm that because the investigation is still ongoing.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.868
There's no mention of a murder motive in the briefing files.

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:32.303
It's because we don't have proof yet that it is a murder─

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:37.087
If you have arrested a suspect on the scene, isn't it safe to say that it was a murder?

00:02:37.087 --> 00:02:39.537
And the murder motive is clear.

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:42.509
Senior Manager Yoo Jeong Seok wrote an article that put the suspect at a disadvantage,

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.149
and that's why the suspect killed him.

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:49.103
We cannot quickly conclude that─

00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:52.126
Senior Manager Yoo was a senior colleague for the press team.

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:55.579
A journalist was murdered for an article he wrote.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.283
That's a fact!

00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:00.446
If you do not admit to this fact,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:05.560
we journalists will question whether there was outside involvement in this case.

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:12.832
The lawyer read the articles about me and called me.

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:18.527
I heard the journalists are banding together to call me a murderer.

00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:21.790
That's what Yoo Jeong Seok wanted.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.520
"Don't remember me as a murderer."

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:29.120
"Remember me as a journalist with a conscience who was sacrificed by a murderer."

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.407
If Yoo Jeong Seok really killed himself, as you say,

00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:38.704
why did we find your DNA under his nails and your footprint on his clothes?

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:41.480
How are you going to explain that?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.738
Is this how you framed Lee Dae Cheol for murder too?

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.099
Hyeongnim.

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.063
How dare you say his name,

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:58.577
after what you did to him, you bastard.

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.601
I'll let that slide...

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:16.730
if you admit that you hit me because you hate me so much that you want to kill me.

00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:18.931
Isn't that it?

00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:22.850
You hate me because of what I did to Lee Dae Cheol, right?

00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:27.705
That's why you're trying so hard to charge me with a crime and throw me into prison.

00:04:27.705 --> 00:04:29.305
Right?

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:37.877
Did Oh Jong Tae admit to his crime?

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:40.642
Of course not! He's never going to admit to it.

00:04:40.642 --> 00:04:44.343
So... what exactly is he claiming?

00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:46.337
He says he killed himself.

00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:47.542
How does that make sense?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:50.924
Why would he call the police and put on a show if he were going to kill himself?

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.760
Have you ever seen something like that before?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.509
You didn't get anything from the CCTV or the dashcam?

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.954
No. Nothing was caught on video.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:04:58.715
Any other proof?

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.630
All we have right now points to murder.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.698
All right, let's conclude that it was a murder.

00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:09.292
But we can't exclude the possibility that it was a suicide.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.268
We'll investigate that angle too.

00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.955
If we can't find anything, let's hand him over to the prosecution.

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:18.854
The reporters are really killing me.

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:23.534

No, sir.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.822
That's a relief.

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:45.431
You must be very disappointed in Jeong Seok.

00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:50.508
I know you really believed in him.

00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:56.008
My boss finished all the work himself before leaving.

00:06:56.008 --> 00:07:01.592
At least in that regard, he was the same senior manager that I've always known.

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:10.677
Did Jeong Seok say anything to you before he died?

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:15.226
He said there was something he needed to take care of.

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.167
I get it now.

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:27.130

Should I head home?

00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:47.185
Yoo Jeong Seok probably knew that Oh Jong Tae couldn't be charged for Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:07:47.185 --> 00:07:50.471
If murder is added on top of conspiracy to commit murder,

00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.165
Oh Jong Tae will receive the maximum sentence.

00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:55.971
Maybe that's what Yoo Jeong Seok wanted.

00:07:55.971 --> 00:08:04.064
So, are you saying that Yoo Jeong Seok set Oh Jong Tae up for murder purposely?

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:07.026
Maybe it was to make up for what he did to Lee Dae Cheol.

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.626
Hey.

00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:12.562
Do you think he has that kind of conscience?

00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:19.572
He killed two people and did everything he could to get Lee Dae Cheol executed.

00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:24.381
And now he wants to make up for what he did because his crimes are about to be exposed?

00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:29.033
Yoo Jeong Seok is just as bad as Oh Jong Tae, if not worse.

00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:34.074
Why should we have to make the last moments look good for someone like him?

Okay, got it.

Why are you asking me that?

You said Senior Manager Yoo feared for his life before he died, right?

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:55.030
Then why did he meet with Oh Jong Tae?

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.112
I was wondering if he told you anything.

00:09:58.112 --> 00:10:03.091
He told me that if he died, I need to investigate his death as a murder.

00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:04.004
Anything else?

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:07.770
I think he wanted to convince Oh Jong Tae to turn himself in.

00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:16.059
He wrote an article confessing to his crimes to fulfill his duties as a journalist,

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:22.440
and in order to prove that Lee Dae Cheol was wrongfully executed, he met with another killer, Oh Jong Tae

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.918
but failed to convince him to admit to his crime.

00:10:24.918 --> 00:10:28.760
They got into a scuffle, and he was murdered by Oh Jong Tae.

a growing number of people are calling for questions about Lee Dae Cheol's case to also be answered.

There are also continuous criticisms for a problematic legal system that were exposed during his retrial.

00:14:34.388 --> 00:14:36.268
This is ironic.

00:14:36.268 --> 00:14:40.348
My work unintentionally benefited you during the retrial,

00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:41.762
but now it's the opposite.

00:14:41.762 --> 00:14:46.281
Then why don't you just continue working in my favor?

00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:47.985
No need to switch sides.

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:51.085
I don't want to switch sides either,

00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:54.387
but my superiors do.

00:14:55.407 --> 00:14:57.716
What brings you here, Sir?

00:14:59.378 --> 00:15:01.635
I wanted to stop by and see how it's going.

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.034
Is this the defendant?

00:15:04.034 --> 00:15:05.235
Yes, sir.

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:09.831
Don't think that you'll automatically get the guilty verdict.

00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:16.247
You have to admit to some things in order to get a favorable verdict at the trial.

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:17.712
All right then.

00:15:17.712 --> 00:15:19.729
Attorney General.

00:15:19.729 --> 00:15:23.477
Have you returned to your post as Incheon's district attorney general?

00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:25.201
Yes, that's right.

00:15:25.201 --> 00:15:31.194
The fact you're returning to work will be good for me, right?

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.616
Have we met before?

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:39.307
I don't remember it.

00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:44.036
Am I mistaken?

00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:46.579
Hey, Prosecutor Jeong. Do a good job.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.313
This will be my first case after returning to work.

00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:49.730
You better feel the pressure.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.740
Don't worry, Sir.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.526
For your informationi,

00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:12.837
the District Attorney General and the victim were hometown friends.

00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:16.204
You got quite unlucky with this one.

00:16:23.268 --> 00:16:28.001
Jeong Seok asked to meet with me the night before he died.

00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.633
He said he needed to tell me something.

00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:31.792
Why did he want to see you?

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:34.948
He knew that I was going to return as Incheon's district attorney general.

00:16:34.948 --> 00:16:40.137
So, what did Jeong Seok say to you?

00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:42.960
I'm writing an article right now.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:48.125
I'm going to reveal everything with Oh Jong Tae in it.

00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:52.493
You remember what you said to me and Reporter Jin at the church, right?

00:16:52.493 --> 00:16:56.976
Hey, I told you I had no choice but to say that given the circumstances.

00:16:56.976 --> 00:17:01.268
Anyway, the story won't make sense if I don't include you in it.

00:17:01.268 --> 00:17:03.484
Jeong Seok, why do you have to─

00:17:03.484 --> 00:17:07.086
I'm going to also write about how I killed Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo.

00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:08.502
What?

00:17:08.502 --> 00:17:12.680
The case won't be investigated without your confession.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.880
You can just bury it.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.055
Why would you make a confession?

00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:20.322
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:24.500
I don't want to live with that burden anymore.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.070
It's my choice, so please respect it.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.407
You haven't handed over the article yet, right?

00:17:30.407 --> 00:17:32.165
Think this over.

00:17:32.165 --> 00:17:34.868
You need to think not just about yourself but about your brother's future.

00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.948
Once you return to your post as the district attorney general,

00:17:36.948 --> 00:17:39.023
don't worry about me and make sure Oh Jong Tae

00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:41.945
pays for what he did, even if you have to make up a charge.

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:43.895
Why?

00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:45.728
Why would you do that?

00:17:45.728 --> 00:17:48.049
You'll find out the reason later.

00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:50.175
You'll see why I had to drag Oh Jong Tae down.

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:52.001
What? Why?

00:17:52.001 --> 00:17:55.610
I'll publish an article about you.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.767
That's the deal I'm offering.

00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:02.093
Did you talk this over with Jeong Ryeol?

00:18:02.093 --> 00:18:06.667
Jeong Ryeol will know even if I don't tell him.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:11.487
No one else knows me better than he does.

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:26.933
Jeong Ryeol will know where I would want to be after everything is over.

00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:28.409
[Yoo Jeong Seok]

00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:45.743
Is something going on?

00:18:45.743 --> 00:18:46.493
Yeah.

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:52.257
Minister Yoo is going to make an announcement regarding Senior Manager Yoo's death.

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:01.965
I'm Yoo Jeong Ryeol, the Minister of Justice.

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:05.087
The case regarding Yoo Jeong Seok, the senior manager of Jeonghan Daily News,

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:10.348
has left me and my family in great pain.

00:19:10.348 --> 00:19:12.268
As a nation's Minister of Justice,

00:19:12.268 --> 00:19:15.900
I would like to sincerely apologize for shocking

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.327
the people with my family's private matter.

00:19:18.327 --> 00:19:21.337
Shouldn't he have given us an exclusive interview?

00:19:21.337 --> 00:19:22.267
Be quiet.

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:26.792
My brother Yoo Jeong Seok was a murderer.

00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:32.188
No matter what the reason was, murder is an unforgivable crime.

00:19:32.188 --> 00:19:38.763
I also feel responsible for my brother's crimes.

00:19:38.763 --> 00:19:46.159
I will be taking responsibility for them and stepping down from my post as of today.

00:19:51.978 --> 00:19:56.229
Oh Jong Tae's lawyer is claiming that the victim committed suicide.

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:57.633
What do you think?

00:19:57.633 --> 00:20:00.031
I think there is a possibility.

00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:02.288
This is going to be a hard case.

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:07.776
You're good at strategizing.

00:20:07.776 --> 00:20:10.130
Isn't that how you survived here until now?

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:18.884
There's a clear motive for conspiring to kill Park Geon Ho.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:22.394
The case received a verdict at the retrial.

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:26.756
So it will be a little hard to use proof of you killing Yoon Ji Seon at this trial.

00:20:27.337 --> 00:20:30.718
The Minister of Justice resigned because of his brother.

00:20:30.718 --> 00:20:34.992
I think the case with Yoo Jeong Seok will be wrapped up in a way that is respectful of the victim.

00:20:34.992 --> 00:20:37.952
From my perspective, I think Yoo Jeong Seok's murder

00:20:37.952 --> 00:20:41.947
should be easier to solve than Park Geon Ho's case.

00:20:41.947 --> 00:20:43.329
You're complicating things for yourself.

00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:45.990
I didn't kill Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:51.064
You should be able to accept that if you look the case over carefully.

00:20:51.064 --> 00:20:53.162
You should think about it.

00:20:53.162 --> 00:20:56.201
That's all I have for you.

00:20:58.412 --> 00:21:00.036
CEO Oh.

00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:02.533
The death sentence hasn't been abolished yet.

00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:04.557
Keep that in mind.

00:21:07.025 --> 00:21:10.028
I didn't think you would come.

00:21:10.028 --> 00:21:11.793
Thanks for coming.

00:21:11.793 --> 00:21:16.240
I haven't known you for that long,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.103
but it seems like you try hard to look at the truth without any bias.

00:21:20.103 --> 00:21:22.127
Correct.

00:21:22.127 --> 00:21:25.352
That's why I tried to reveal that you were the real killer.

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:27.236
As I expected, you're very direct.

00:21:27.236 --> 00:21:32.280
You know what kind of person Yoo Jeong Seok was, right?

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.056
He was a very impressive man.

00:21:35.056 --> 00:21:42.864
So you get why he did that in his last moments, right?

00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:46.585
A journalist should write about the truth.

00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:49.390
It will help Senior Manager Yoo.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.920
He sacrificed his own life to put me on trial as a murderer.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.572
But if this gets concluded as murder,

00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:02.774
no one will find out about his honorable intention.

00:22:02.774 --> 00:22:04.961
Shouldn't you reveal it to the people?

00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.727
You need to reveal the truth as a journalist.

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:12.506
If you keep your silence,

00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:16.109
you would live the rest of your life being tortured by guilt.

00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:19.889
Thanks. I didn't know what to do.

00:22:19.889 --> 00:22:21.938
I could've regretted it for the rest of my life.

00:22:21.938 --> 00:22:22.969
I know.

00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:26.520
A journalist must dig up the truth.

00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:30.059
But I just realized

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:34.264
that the truth could destroy my life.

00:22:34.264 --> 00:22:40.719
I could've regretted helping someone like you for the rest of my life.

00:22:40.719 --> 00:22:43.869
You need to be taken to court as a murderer for my sake.

00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:47.967
Do you realize that you're admitting to being Yoo Jeong Seok's accomplice?

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.924
I don't care.

00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:52.952
All I did was choose the path that will be easier for me.

00:22:52.952 --> 00:22:55.385
I'm going to keep my silence.

00:22:55.385 --> 00:22:58.165
Like how you kept your silence when you knew

00:22:58.165 --> 00:23:02.075
Lee Dae Cheol was being executed in your place.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.362
Detective Kang, you don't really like me

00:23:08.362 --> 00:23:10.806
because of what happened with Lee Dae Cheol's retrial, right?

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.109
Of course, I don't like you.

00:23:13.109 --> 00:23:14.743
You're so honest.

00:23:14.743 --> 00:23:16.812
You worked so hard on the retrial,

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:20.196
so we should make sure Oh Jong Tae pays for what he did this time, right?

00:23:20.196 --> 00:23:22.002
This has nothing to do with the retrial.

00:23:22.002 --> 00:23:25.320
We conducted the investigation as objectively as we could.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:30.651
To be honest, we don't have enough evidence to prove that it was murder.

00:23:30.651 --> 00:23:33.444
Please find the evidence for me.

00:23:33.444 --> 00:23:36.069
That's the only way we can put him away.

00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:41.019
You want to win this trial, right?

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:42.154
Sure.

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:47.531
Then admit that what you did at Lee Dae Cheol's retrial was wrong.

00:23:47.531 --> 00:23:50.041
Then you will win this trial.

00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:51.436
What did I do wrong?

00:23:51.436 --> 00:23:54.260
You know that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.872
I'm saying that you'll be able to put Oh Jong Tae away

00:23:57.872 --> 00:24:00.256
if you reveal that truth at the trial.

00:24:01.155 --> 00:24:03.238
How will that benefit me?

00:24:03.238 --> 00:24:05.690
You'll become a prosecutor with a conscience.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.872
And win the trial.

00:24:07.872 --> 00:24:09.995
A prosecutor with a conscience?

00:24:13.235 --> 00:24:15.201
That's not a bad idea.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:53.597
This is a dashcam video of Yoo Jeong Seok killing Jo Seong Gi and Jang Jin Soo.

00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:57.440
Your Honor, this trial is about the defendant, Oh Jong Tae.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.147
This video has no relation to the trial.

00:24:59.147 --> 00:25:02.611
Defender, why are you showing us this clip?

00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:06.873
The defendant obtained this video right before Yoo Jeong Seok died.

00:25:06.873 --> 00:25:10.974
After obtaining this video, the defendant sent it to Yoo Jeong Seok right away.

00:25:10.974 --> 00:25:13.135
He was telling him to turn himself in.

00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:16.638
- Your Honor, this is─
- Defender, please continue.

00:25:16.638 --> 00:25:17.630
Yes, Your Honor.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.600
After seeing the video, Yoo Jeong Seok asked to meet with the defendant.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.690
You can confirm that through the defendant's call history.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:31.078
And this clip is something the police have not even obtained yet.

00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:36.913
Why did the defendant keep that video hidden?

00:25:36.913 --> 00:25:39.845
He didn't reveal it because he didn't want this

00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:44.812
gruesome video to hurt the deceased's reputation.

00:25:44.812 --> 00:25:49.896
At the time of the incident, Yoo Jeong Seok asked the defendant to destroy the video.

00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:52.066
But the defendant refused.

00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:57.143
And the scuffle happened because Yoo Jeong Seok tried to take the video

00:25:57.143 --> 00:26:01.004
while the defendant wanted to reveal his crimes.

00:26:01.004 --> 00:26:01.985
In the end,

00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:05.868
Yoo Jeong Seok realized that he wouldn't be able to change the defendant's mind,

00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:10.090
and jumped off the bridge out of despair.

00:26:19.647 --> 00:26:25.547
Witness, you've been chasing after the real killer since Lee Dae Cheol's execution, right?

00:26:25.547 --> 00:26:29.467
And right now, you're in charge of the defendant's case.

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:30.791
That's correct.

00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:34.331
As the detective who investigated this case,

00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:39.735
what do you think about the defendant's claim that the victim had killed himself?

00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:52.169
Oh Jong Tae killed Yoon Ji Seon

00:26:52.169 --> 00:26:57.236
and paid off a detective to frame someone else.

00:26:57.236 --> 00:27:00.498
In addition, he conspired to kill Park Geon Ho

00:27:00.498 --> 00:27:04.705
and paid off the detective once again

00:27:05.243 --> 00:27:08.109
to disguise the murder as a suicide.

00:27:08.764 --> 00:27:14.435
That has already been proven by the evidence that we have obtained.

00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:19.820
Oh Jong Tae has avoided punishment through framing and bribery,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.177
and now he's claiming that the victim killed himself.

00:27:24.177 --> 00:27:29.053
If we fall for his lies again,

00:27:29.053 --> 00:27:36.626
we would be killing Lee Dae Cheol one more time, even after his wrongful death.

00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:41.339
Understood.

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:49.080
I was the prosecutor in charge of Lee Dae Cheol's retrial.

00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:54.529
If a prosecutor who sent Lee Dae Cheol to his execution chair

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:56.569
admits that he was innocent

00:27:56.569 --> 00:27:59.793
and claims that the defendant had framed him,

00:27:59.793 --> 00:28:03.878
it would leave a big stain on his reputation as a prosecutor.

00:28:03.878 --> 00:28:05.613
However,

00:28:05.613 --> 00:28:10.585
I would like to put my conscience on the line to tell you all the truth.

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.451
Lee Dae Cheol is innocent,

00:28:13.451 --> 00:28:19.009
and everything was set up by the defendant, Oh Jong Tae, who is the real killer!

00:28:26.967 --> 00:28:29.898
You can send the tip to my email and leave me your contact information.

00:28:29.898 --> 00:28:32.831
I'll reach out to you after I review it.

00:28:34.327 --> 00:28:36.069
Isn't today Oh Jong Tae's final trial?

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:37.633
Yes, I sent the legal team.

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:40.347
Shouldn't you write the article?

00:28:40.347 --> 00:28:42.788
You know more about this than anyone.

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:44.788
I'm sorry.

00:28:44.788 --> 00:28:48.143
I don't think I can write one this time.

00:28:48.912 --> 00:28:51.233
Okay, I understand.

00:28:55.649 --> 00:29:00.723
For the crime of conspiring to kill Park Geon Ho. Guilty.

00:29:00.723 --> 00:29:04.626
For the murder of Yoo Jeong Seok. Guilty.

00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:10.048
I sentence the defendant, Oh Jong Tae, to life in prison.

00:29:25.644 --> 00:29:29.144
No one here has the right to criticize me.

00:29:29.144 --> 00:29:32.331
You are all the same.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.003
Okay. Good work.

00:29:44.838 --> 00:29:47.603
Attention everyone!

00:29:47.603 --> 00:29:49.635
He's been found guilty of all charges.

00:29:49.635 --> 00:29:52.268
Oh Jong Tae was sentenced to life in prison!

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.390
Nice.

00:29:59.253 --> 00:30:01.153
There's one bottle left.

00:30:02.564 --> 00:30:03.964
Hey.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.230
Want a drink?

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.355
I'm okay.

00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:11.280
Have a drink!

00:30:11.858 --> 00:30:13.508
No, I'm okay.

00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:16.500
Why did you leave a soju bottle in the office?

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.100
I weirdly feel empty after solving a case.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.008
I feel better if I drink a bottle of soju before going home.

00:30:25.008 --> 00:30:28.573
There was a time when I would drink four to five bottles a month.

00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:30.495
But I haven't had the occasion to drink for a while,

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.044
so I forgot to fill the fridge back up.

Hyeongnim.

Yes?

00:30:38.472 --> 00:30:40.865
I have a question.

00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:43.675
What is it this time?

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.209
I get nervous when you say you have a question.

00:30:47.209 --> 00:30:49.667
What is it?

00:30:50.908 --> 00:30:54.235
You know, you saw the video at the trial.

00:30:54.235 --> 00:30:56.015
What about it?

00:30:56.015 --> 00:30:59.970
It proves that Yoo Jeong Seok was the killer. What else do you want?

00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:04.844
What do you think... where did he get the video from─

00:31:04.844 --> 00:31:07.244
Stop. I've already exceeded my limit.

00:31:07.244 --> 00:31:10.323
It will all be over once I finish this bottle.

00:31:10.323 --> 00:31:13.022
No more!

00:31:34.863 --> 00:31:36.519
What are you doing here?

00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:38.435
Are you here to see your mom?

00:31:38.435 --> 00:31:41.769
I'm sorry, but your mom went out to look for a job.

00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.489
Should I call her to come home?

00:31:43.489 --> 00:31:47.162
No, I'll just leave.

00:31:48.043 --> 00:31:50.670
Hey, Kim Jae Woong!

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.411
Why didn't you go to school today?

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:56.911
You need to go to school. Your mom will be upset if you don't.

00:31:56.911 --> 00:32:00.281
There's a field trip today,

00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:02.950
but I didn't want to go.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.597
Why not? Are you not feeling well?

00:32:05.597 --> 00:32:06.844
Why didn't you go on the field trip?

00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:10.481
I'm okay. I just...

00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:13.219
I just didn't want to go.

00:32:14.574 --> 00:32:17.240
Do you want to hang out with me then?

00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:23.684
- Did you tell your dad?
- No.

00:32:23.684 --> 00:32:25.990
What are you going to do if he finds out?

00:32:26.467 --> 00:32:28.840
Let's go home after you finish that.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.217
Your dad will be angry when he finds out you didn't go to school.

00:32:31.217 --> 00:32:33.659
- I don't need to go home.
- Why not?

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:37.317
My dad and the ahjumma aren't home. They don't even come home.

00:32:37.317 --> 00:32:39.536
Did they go on a trip on their own?

00:32:39.536 --> 00:32:41.469
And leave you behind?

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.360
Tell me.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.930
Why won't they come home?

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.886
The ahjumma had a baby.

00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:54.719
The baby is so young, so they said they have to be with the baby.

00:32:55.871 --> 00:32:57.964
They're at a postnatal care center.

00:32:57.964 --> 00:33:00.760
So you're staying home alone?

00:33:01.321 --> 00:33:03.220
My goodness.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.184
So your dad must not have known that you were going on a field trip today.

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.536
You didn't want to go because he didn't pack you anything, huh?

00:33:08.536 --> 00:33:12.531
It's because of the baby.

00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.597
Not because he doesn't like me.

00:33:16.753 --> 00:33:18.353
Jae Woong.

00:33:18.353 --> 00:33:21.657
Then should we hang out until late today?

00:33:21.657 --> 00:33:25.503
I've been bored because nobody wanted to play with me.

Yes, hello.

Got it.

That's what I want to ask you. What happened to Jae Woong?

You met with him, huh? You did, right?

Did you yell at him or something?

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:26.228
I found out he was going on a field trip after I got the call from his school.

00:35:26.228 --> 00:35:29.096
You didn't even know he was going on a field trip?

00:35:29.096 --> 00:35:31.620
Then you must've not packed anything for him!

And?

He said he can't find Jae Woong.

00:37:40.917 --> 00:37:43.762
He even took his phone away!

Of course, a mom was in shock when she heard her kid is missing.

I don't want to hear any more.

00:37:58.728 --> 00:38:00.456
I just want to stop doing this.

00:38:00.456 --> 00:38:02.789

00:38:06.057 --> 00:38:07.961
- Jae Woong.
- Hey!

00:38:07.961 --> 00:38:09.471
What do you think you're doing?

00:38:09.471 --> 00:38:14.128
This violates the restraining order, you know that?

00:38:15.557 --> 00:38:18.042
Jae Woong, come here.

00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:23.406
You little!

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:25.074
Do you think you should apologize or not?

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:27.520
I'm sorry.

00:38:28.006 --> 00:38:30.462
Did you meet with your mom?

00:38:30.462 --> 00:38:32.855
How does she know that you go to a judo studio?

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:35.980
- Did you meet with her or not?
- We didn't meet.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.049
I only found out because my friend owns the studio and gave me a call.

00:38:39.049 --> 00:38:40.885
Did you meet with her or not?

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:43.785
You'll be in big trouble if you lie!

00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:45.441
I met with her.

00:38:45.441 --> 00:38:47.260
Jae Woong, when did we meet?

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:53.034
Mom came while I was asleep.

00:38:53.034 --> 00:38:57.530
I pretended to be asleep when she came,

00:38:58.036 --> 00:39:01.019
and kept my eyes closed.

00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:06.178
You little brat!

00:39:06.178 --> 00:39:10.048
Didn't I tell you your mom would go to jail if you met with her?

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.708
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:16.411
Please don't send mom to jail.

00:39:16.411 --> 00:39:20.272
Honey. Honey, it's all my fault.

00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:23.019
It's all my fault, don't get mad at Jae Woong.

00:39:23.019 --> 00:39:27.473
I'll give up on the lawsuit.

00:39:27.473 --> 00:39:29.447
I won't try to get anything.

00:39:29.447 --> 00:39:31.448
I won't ever meet with him again.

00:39:31.448 --> 00:39:36.939
Just... Just treat Jae Woong well.

00:39:38.088 --> 00:39:41.930
Please just treat Jae Hong well.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.630
I don't want anything else.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.461
Okay?

00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:53.678
I'll let it go this time.

00:39:53.678 --> 00:39:57.472
You can't meet with your mom ever again, understood?

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:04.159
Why didn't you go on the field trip?

00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:05.816
You didn't even tell me you were going.

00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:08.754
He couldn't tell you because you weren't home.

00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:11.370
I heard the lady you live with had a baby.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:15.253
You weren't able to take care of Jae Woong because you were looking after her and the baby.

00:40:15.253 --> 00:40:17.487
Why are you blaming Jae Woong?

00:40:23.767 --> 00:40:25.106
What are you talking about?

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:27.713
Why did you tell her that?

00:40:27.713 --> 00:40:30.680
Why would you tell this stranger─

00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:33.922
Wait.

00:40:33.922 --> 00:40:37.170
Haven't we met before?

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.854
You're the girl from the judo studio, right?

00:40:40.535 --> 00:40:44.568
So you guys all planned this behind my back.

00:40:44.568 --> 00:40:49.050
She finally had the baby.

00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:50.918
Right.

00:40:50.918 --> 00:40:56.669
When I saw her in front of your home, she was pretty far along.

00:40:56.669 --> 00:40:58.674
How long has it been since your divorce?

00:40:58.674 --> 00:41:00.066
Less than six months.

00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:05.751
Well, she delivered the baby already, which means they were together even before the divorce.

00:41:05.751 --> 00:41:08.266
That means he committed adultery.

00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:12.258
- Hey, Kim Sang Soo!
- You don't know what you're talking about!

00:41:12.258 --> 00:41:15.044
It's not my baby.

00:41:15.044 --> 00:41:18.605
I met her after she got pregnant. Got it?

00:41:18.605 --> 00:41:21.625
Hey. Tell me the truth.

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.384
- Stop lying.
- Don't come near me.

00:41:23.384 --> 00:41:25.555
Should I just call the police? Huh?

00:41:25.555 --> 00:41:27.174
Should I just call them?

00:41:27.174 --> 00:41:32.110
Talking about something you don't know much about

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.290
is defamation.

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.800
I'm sure you all know that.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.456
Hey, Kim Sang Soo! Hey! You little...

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:42.440
Oppa, Jae Woong is here too.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.706
Let's not talk about something that can hurt him.

00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:52.515
Yeah. If detectives come asking about the baby,

00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:55.180
just say that you don't know anything.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.860
And you have to tell them that we've been together for less than three months.

00:42:00.337 --> 00:42:03.140
They will give us a hard time if you don't.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.133
Things got a little complicated because Jae Woong said something he shouldn't have.

00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:09.211
What?

00:42:09.211 --> 00:42:13.331
Hey, he's just a kid! Why would you curse at him?

00:42:14.795 --> 00:42:17.928
He just doesn't know how to lie.

00:42:17.928 --> 00:42:21.135
Are you getting tired of Jae Woong now that you have a baby?

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:25.265
You said you would raise him like he was your own.

00:42:25.265 --> 00:42:27.189
Ah, whatever.

00:42:27.189 --> 00:42:28.680
Bye.

00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:42.295
Jae Woong.

00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:47.909
Could it be that you are mad because you're scared that

00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:55.070
I'm going to like your new sibling more than you?

00:42:56.469 --> 00:43:01.348
You're not too comfortable with your stepmom yet, right?

00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:06.498
I'm sorry, Jae Woong.

00:43:06.498 --> 00:43:09.183
I'm really sorry I haven't been able to take good care of you

00:43:09.183 --> 00:43:12.544
because I've been too busy with your new sibling.

00:43:12.544 --> 00:43:14.877
You're all grown up now.

00:43:14.877 --> 00:43:18.630
So I think you should be able to decide now.

00:43:19.424 --> 00:43:25.142
Choose who you want to live with between your mom and me.

00:43:25.142 --> 00:43:28.671
I'll do whatever you want to do.

00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.570
Can't we just do DNA testing?

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.084
If the new baby really is his,

00:43:35.084 --> 00:43:39.095
it confirms that he committed adultery.

00:43:39.095 --> 00:43:43.826
Yes, but you can't do a DNA test without their consent.

00:43:43.826 --> 00:43:45.426
Right.

00:43:45.426 --> 00:43:50.055
Should I just go get them and force them to do the DNA test?

00:43:55.648 --> 00:43:57.554
Jae Woong!

00:43:57.554 --> 00:43:58.823
Mom.

00:43:58.823 --> 00:44:03.912
Dad said I can live with you if I want to.

00:44:03.912 --> 00:44:06.253
Really?

00:44:06.258 --> 00:44:10.251
So did you tell him that you want to live with me?

00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:11.951
Yes.

00:44:13.098 --> 00:44:15.695
Thank you, Jae Woong.

00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:17.899
Thank you, Jae Woong!

00:45:44.976 --> 00:45:47.963
Gook Hyeon, this isn't who you are!
[November 9, 2015, at 23:00 (11pm), Date of Detective Jang's death]

00:45:47.963 --> 00:45:50.230
Why would you do that?

00:45:53.897 --> 00:45:57.110
You're sure you can return everything to its place?

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:58.035
Yes.

00:45:58.035 --> 00:45:59.930
I must've lost my mind for a second.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.830
I'll return everything they gave me,

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:07.037
and I'll arrest Oh Jong Tae myself.

00:46:07.037 --> 00:46:09.635
I promise.

00:46:09.635 --> 00:46:15.396
Then call Oh Jeong Soo right now and tell him that you'll return the money he gave you.

00:46:15.396 --> 00:46:16.823
It's really late right now─

00:46:16.823 --> 00:46:20.568
Just call him and tell him you'll return the money right now!

00:46:20.568 --> 00:46:24.425
That's the only way you can get out of this.

00:46:43.537 --> 00:46:44.370
Where are you going?

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.380
Just call him!

00:47:03.758 --> 00:47:05.358
Hyeong!

00:47:07.508 --> 00:47:09.308
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.080
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:47:14.803 --> 00:47:16.303
Hyeong!

00:47:18.522 --> 00:47:19.694
Hyeong!

00:47:19.694 --> 00:47:21.694
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:47:21.694 --> 00:47:24.110
Hyeong! Wake up!

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.969
Hyeong!

00:47:37.158 --> 00:47:38.398
[President Oh Jeong Soo]

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:46.770
You called? What did you need at this hour?

00:47:47.842 --> 00:47:49.542
CEO.

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:51.141
You see─

00:47:51.165 --> 00:47:54.757
Don't say... did you change your mind?

00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.456
No.

00:47:57.456 --> 00:47:59.609
You see...

00:47:59.609 --> 00:48:02.293
If you think that the money wasn't enough,

00:48:02.293 --> 00:48:05.420
I'll send over the same amount one more time.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.936
Excuse me?

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.799
Gook Hyeon...

00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:16.928
Let's wrap things up quiet and nicely.

00:48:16.928 --> 00:48:18.886
It's too late to go back now.

00:48:18.886 --> 00:48:23.382
There's a record of me sending money to your account.

00:48:23.382 --> 00:48:26.679
It's too late to go back on your word.

00:48:30.517 --> 00:48:32.984
I'll call you back later.

00:48:47.499 --> 00:48:50.037
I'm really sorry!

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:02.406
Hyeongim, I'm really sorry!

00:49:19.219 --> 00:49:23.785
Nam Gook Hyeon took it from the scene and sent it to Oh Jong Tae.

00:49:23.785 --> 00:49:26.646
But he didn't include the clip of him.

00:49:26.646 --> 00:49:28.180
Why are we discovering this now?

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.623
It was caught on a dashcam of a vehicle that was parked in the area.

00:49:31.623 --> 00:49:36.349
Nam Gook Hyeon took it from the owner of the car and deleted it, but I restored the file.

00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:37.951
Why was he holding on to this?

00:49:37.951 --> 00:49:42.312
He had it in case he became a suspect in Detective Jang's murder.

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:46.733
If he only revealed the clip of Yoo Jeong Seok hitting Detective Jang with a rock,

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:49.833
it would make Senior Manager Yoo seem like the killer.

00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:56.135
So my boss believed he had killed Jang Jin Soo when it wasn't really him.

00:49:56.135 --> 00:49:59.087
Nam Gook Hyeon did all of it.

00:49:59.087 --> 00:50:02.942
He killed Jang Jin Soo and buried the body.

00:50:02.942 --> 00:50:08.534
And he framed Lee Dae Cheol for the murder.

00:50:08.534 --> 00:50:13.587
My boss wouldn't have died if this had come to light.

00:50:13.587 --> 00:50:15.937
Let's catch him again.

00:50:16.506 --> 00:50:20.438
We can't close this case until we get him.

00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:27.148
The prosecution won't want to deal with this case anymore.

00:50:27.148 --> 00:50:31.126
And why are you asking me to get the arrest warrant? That's the police's job.

00:50:31.126 --> 00:50:33.086
You saw the video.

00:50:33.086 --> 00:50:36.815
Nam Gook Hyeon is the one who killed Jang Jin Soo. It wasn't Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:50:36.815 --> 00:50:38.995
We need to reveal that, Reporter Jin.

00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:41.970
We can't hold another trial because we already had the retrial.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.134
Why would the prosecution issue an arrest warrant?

00:50:44.134 --> 00:50:49.915
We can't have another trial, but if the prosecution sees this as a separate case, we can investigate it.

00:50:49.915 --> 00:50:52.751
And it seems like the public wants a reinvestigation too.

00:50:52.751 --> 00:50:55.818
It all depends on what the prosecution thinks.

00:50:56.733 --> 00:50:58.966
We've come this far together.

00:50:58.966 --> 00:51:01.188
We need to cross the finish line together too.

00:51:16.718 --> 00:51:19.681
Jeong Seok died for the wrong reason.

00:51:19.681 --> 00:51:23.930
We have to get Nam Gook Hyeon to reveal the truth.

00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:28.454
Things went well with Jeong Seok's case.

00:51:28.454 --> 00:51:30.590
No need to open a new case.

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:34.960
"District Attorney General Kim Gi Tae, who was in charge of Lee Dae Cheol's case

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.710
continued to chase after the truth and discovered what really happened."

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:46.434
That's what the cover of Jeonghan Daily will say along with your picture.

00:51:47.194 --> 00:51:49.265
You can't stay in Incheon forever.

00:51:49.265 --> 00:51:52.098
Shouldn't you climb up to the central district?

00:51:57.906 --> 00:52:00.273
I look forward to your work.

00:52:02.162 --> 00:52:03.962
Reporter Jin!

00:52:04.733 --> 00:52:09.617
Who do you think will win after this is over?

00:52:09.617 --> 00:52:11.162
The police?
