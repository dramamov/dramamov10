00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.280
Kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.640
I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.440
so kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo!

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.510
Department Lead Choi will take care of the rest,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.150
so Gi Dong Jae,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.220
all you need to do is kill her!

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.090
Do you understand?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.330
Thank you for saving me.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.410
I'm giving you this in return.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.330
Yes?

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.430
We found Gi Dong Jae's phone.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.310
As we expected, there was a recording of him and Choi Yong Geun on it talking.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.560
It's a phone call around the time that the body was dumped.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.930
This should be enough to make sure Choi Yong Geun can't make a move.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.940
Okay. I'll be at the office soon.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.660
If you hadn't sent people over, I would have been in trouble.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.280
You see, I have a chronic illness.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.250
I have to get a shot every day to live.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.480
But I think somebody changed the contents of the syringe.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.940
That's why I had an attack.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.880
Are you saying someone did it intentionally?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.670
I'm not sure. This has never happened before.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.420
If this happens again, I'll contact you.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.080
Thank you for coming.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.440
It seems like you have business at the station. You should go.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.690
What I just saw,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.540
is it in that USB?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.510
Yes.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.010
It's an important piece of evidence to prove the crime.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.750
You need to hand it over to the police.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.840
Why?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.800
We can't catch the culprit without it.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.900
It's an illegally filmed video.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.180
Wouldn't that become an issue on my side too?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.810
Well then.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680
My job is done.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.100
Now, it's your turn.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.140
Get them. The culprit.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.120
Without that USB, it might be impossible.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.190
You should catch them.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.750
You clearly saw the culprit with your own two eyes.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.860
Are you going to let them go again because you don't have evidence?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.750
Is that acceptable?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.940
I'll be waiting, with my trust fully in you.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.100
Ji Hyeok, think about it carefully.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.720
You saw who stabbed your father, right?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.680
Do you remember his face?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.900
Try to remember it.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.870
You're the only one who saw.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.120
I didn't come to check on you recently, did I?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.880
I was very busy. I'm sorry.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.550
- It's high.
-The building is high, not the person.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.730
Let's go.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.880
What brings you here?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.960
We're here to take Choi Yong Geun. Where is he?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.450
He went to the chairman's office.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.750
Okay.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.550
Hey, let's go.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.500
Excuse me.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.510
Are you really arresting Team Leader Choi Yong Geun?

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.620
Yes.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.570
The evidence is clear, and all the charges are confirmed.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.820
He can't get away. Choi Yong Geun is finished.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.650
As I thought.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.730
So cool.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.780
Why are you saying such a thing?

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.890
I'm just saying that a cool thing is cool. Why?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.160
Look here, are you saying Violent Crimes Team 2 is cool, or that Detective Kwon Jae Hong is cool?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.590
Detective Kwon Jae Hong...

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.840
Are you seriously saying Jae Hong Hyeong is cool?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.640
Who's Detective Kwon Jae Hong?

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.970
You didn't even know his name?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.930
The Gi Dong Jae problem has been absolutely taken care of,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.570
but I think there is a small annoying issue now.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.070
Worst case, I might have a reason to run to the police station.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.640
Why would you?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.500
Kim Min Ji.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.420
Kim Min Ji?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.570
Don't worry about me, and go to Kim Min Ji.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.360
You must make sure she stays quiet and doesn't do anything reckless.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.100
Give her money, or her child,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.140
but get her on your side no matter what.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.990
If you fail to control her─

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.430
What the hell are you trying to say right now?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.030
Chairman.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.050
Who are you guys?

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.220
This is an arrest warrant for Mr. Choi Yong Geun.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.330
Keep in mind what I just told you.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.030
- Arrest him.
- I'll do it.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.780
Choi Yong Geun, you're under arrest on suspicion of soliciting the murder of Jeong Hui Joo.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.240
You have the right to speak to an attorney,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.470
and you have the right to remain silent.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.960
You have the right to refuse to say anything that can be used against you in court.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.270
Do you understand?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.830
You bastard.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.780
Don't touch that. It's an art piece.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.280
Do you think that's a rice wine glass?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.900
Why is he like that? Did the suspect resist arrest?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.620
I don't know.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.450
I was so angry,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.690
so I don't remember what I did at all.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.100
You should've just gotten arrested without resistance.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.090
You know how angry we are.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.700
Come on, take him gently.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.510
Have a good day.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.360
I'll see you soon, Chairman.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.950
Do you have someone you love?

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.130
No.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.240
I don't have anyone yet.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.620
You didn't love him.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.780
Then you shouldn't have had his child.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.130
Can a child born without love

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.440
be happy?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.260
Even now, I want to ask my mother

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.950
why she had me.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.370
Was it for her own greed or

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.930
was it really because of my happiness.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.290
What's the child's name?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.190
Soo Yeon.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.230
Soo Yeon.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.350
I hope that child won't be unhappy, unlike me.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.670
I-I'm sorry.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.010
I'm so sorry.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.220
You suffered a lot, didn't you?

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.740
Soo Yeon

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.910
and her mother.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.640
I'll make sure to make you two happy.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.570
The car that you used to move the body? Drive it a bit, and then drown it.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.910
Even if you take it to a junkyard or burn it, the DNA stays. Put it in water no matter what.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.820
And check if there's any evidence in there before you dump it.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.200
Burn all your belongings until everything becomes ash.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.310
Okay, I will.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.260
When a huge company's beautiful employee in her twenties goes missing, or if her dead body is found,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.290
the investigation starts with the people around her.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.390
The surest way to block the investigation of those people,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.880
and to hide the real motive for the murder,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.310
was to make her a victim of a serial killer.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.360
You got this idea from your extensive investigation experience.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.140
"There was no possibility serial killer Lee Seong Gon would be caught."

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.020
"Even if he were caught, he would deny all the crimes,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.590
and the police who caught the serial killer

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.650
also would have no good reason to reveal a copycat crime."

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.840
"There's also no way to prove it."

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.050
That's why you got the photos of the serial murder crime scene from the police

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.090
and sent them to Gi Dong Jae.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.840
Gi Dong Jae, who murdered Jeong Hui Joo,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.600
did exactly as you instructed.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.110
Is that what Gi Dong Jae said?

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.610
It's what was recorded on Gi Dong Jae's phone.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.590
The fact that Gi Dong Jae is the owner of the phone is definitely confirmed.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.970
Even without Gi Dong Jae's confession, it's possible to prove that you instructed him.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:24.890
That means that it has been revealed that you are the one who ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.700
What could it be?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.430
The reason for me to murder Jeong Hui Joo, what on earth could that be?

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.540
Jeong Hui Joo was simply an employee on my team.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.540
Would that count as a motive for the murder?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.710
Team Leader,

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.670
you are really unlucky.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:52.020
If you hadn't drug me into the Kim Min Ji assault case two years ago,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.580
it would have been quite hard to find the motive for murder in the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.820
Team Leader Woo Tae Ho, Director Cheon Na Na, and Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.270
I met all of them through that case.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:12.210
Coincidentally, the past, and the current case are threaded together.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.470
Your choice is the only one left.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.600
Will you become the suspect for ordering her murder,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.360
or will you reveal the real culprit

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.330
and just be released for the lesser crime of abandoning a corpse.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.980
The murder was actually ordered by someone else.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.010
All you did was connect that person with Gi Dong Jae.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:41.770
"Will you reveal the real culprit, or will you take all the blame?"

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.310
That's a method I often used in the past.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.950
Someone who can be persuaded by that is quite naive, don't you think?

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.360
That kind of thing is something a judge should say in court, not a detective.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.030
Good job coming this far.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.090
But this is as far as you'll go.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.890
Don't waste your energy,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.950
and leave the rest to the prosecutor and the judge.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.290
Choi Yong Geun

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.050
does not want to deal with us anymore.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.960
He won't confess, either.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.390
As things stand, we might not get up to Cheon Sang Woo,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.030
and have been stopped at Choi Yong Geun.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.320
Let's talk realistically.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.540
Choi Yong Geun is a true bad guy.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.400
He's the one who made my own daughter explode with anger.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.900
Even just arresting Choi Yong Geun

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.160
is a big blow against the huge TJ Group.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.320
So now, we should accept the reality─

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.260
No. I can't accept that.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.980
I clearly saw and heard Cheon Sang Woo order the crime with my own eyes and ears.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.420
Did you meet with Team Leader Choi Yong Geun?

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.190
- Yes.
- What did he say?

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.840
He said that there was something you needed to personally check on his computer.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.860
What on earth is it?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.790
He said that those documents may have gone to the police.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.000
That it would be best for you to check those and prepare.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.910
I'd never be able to see my child.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.560
And

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.380
he said he'd order someone to make sure that Hui Joo

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.670
couldn't talk.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.650
He said, "she had an affair with the team leader anyway"

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.130
and "she deserves to die and more."

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.060
To reveal Cheon Sang Woo's motive for murder,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.430
doesn't the video that Detective Oh saw have to be in our hands?

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.370
Do you think she would give it to us easily?

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.620
She might get arrested herself for illegally filming that.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.210
And even if she did hand it to us, it was illegally filmed,

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.250
and thus would be rejected as a piece of tainted evidence.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.840
Then why did she show it to Detective Oh?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.440
It's obvious. She's telling us to take her brother away.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.750
If the chairman gets arrested, who would that seat go to?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.710
Cheon Seong Dae is in jail too, so if her brother went as well,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.530
Cheon Na Na would be the only one left in the family.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.330
Cheon Na Na's has only one intention.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.510
"The culprit who ordered the murder was Cheon Sang Woo."

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.450
She was making sure we were convinced.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.420
We already knew that without her having to convince us.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.380
Anyway, how are we supposed to arrest a star in the sky like Cheon Sang Woo?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.770
Cheon Sang Woo's name has to come out of Choi Yong Geun's mouth, right?

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.990
Do you think that'll be easy? Choi Yong Geun will only hold onto Gi Dong Jae.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.990
And also, if he says all he did was instruct Gi Dong Jae,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.310
he doesn't have to drag Cheon Sang Woo into this.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.960
- Where's Gi Dong Jae now?
- We looked for him, but he totally disappeared.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.750
He went abroad or got caught by Goo Jae Choon and got buried.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.270
So, are we back at square one?

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.690
I didn't get the video, but it's still in my mind.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.780
Before Cheon Sang Woo told Gi Dong Jae to kill Jeong Hui Joo,

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.850
his motive for murder was in the conversation he had with Jeong Hui Joo.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.280
We just need to find that and prove it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.750
To find that, we'd have to investigate Cheon Sang Woo in person. That won't be easy.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.460
He saw Choi Yong Geun get arrested right in front of him. Don't you think he'll shield himself thoroughly?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.080
We need to follow Woo Tae Ho and Jeong Hui Joo, not Cheon Sang Woo.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.210
Woo Tae Ho and Jeong Hui Joo, who are both dead.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.890
Isn't it better to chase the living Cheon Sang Woo?

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.480
You remember that the password to the safe was written in Jeong Hui Joo's diary, right?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.790
Yeah, I do.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:13.420
In the video Cheon Na Na showed me, there's something Cheon Sang Woo said to Jeong Hui Joo.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:19.590
I told you to sneak out what he hid, not to use it yourself!

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.920
Yes, Ahjumeoni, it's me.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.760
Put Soo Yeon on, please.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.330
Hi, Soo Yeon.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.220
Is it Soo Yeon?

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.880
Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon?

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.190
Mommy!

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.920
Sorry that Daddy can't be there.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.870
- Soo Yeon.
- When I have time,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.290
I'll come with Mommy to see you.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.650
- Soo Yeon.
- Oh, yay!

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.010
- Soo Yeon.
- Hold on a little longer.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.700
Listen to Ahjumma until Mommy and Daddy come to see you,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.140
- Soo Yeon.
- and be a good girl.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.160
- Okay.
- Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon!

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.870
Give me the phone, please! Just so I can see Soo Yeon's face once more.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.830
Please give it to me.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.850
You saw that Soo Yeon is well.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.460
Where's Soo Yeon? Where is she right now?

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.420
Sit down.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.780
Sit down!

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.520
I won't ask why you said such things to Woo Tae Ho.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.100
Instead, just don't go to the trial and testify in person.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.400
If the police keep asking you, all you have to say is that you missed Soo Yeon very much,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.700
and you hated me so much, that you made things up.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.740
It's not something you told the police. It was just something you said to Woo Tae Ho.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.980
So even if you say that, there will be no harm to you.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.020
We need to go to America to see Soo Yeon, right?

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.420
Don't you miss her?

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.260
Now that I've seen Soo Yeon is doing well, everything is fine.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.460
Soo Yeon called you "Daddy."

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.130
You've admitted it.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.980
Right?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.150
Go to your father and tell him

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.210
that he has a granddaughter.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.870
- What?
- I'm saying,

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.470
accept Soo Yeon as the granddaughter of your family. Only then,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.990
Soo Yeon will be fine even without me.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.240
I don't care what happens to me.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.370
Just do that.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.140
Then, as you wish,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.680
I'll do everything.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.390
Shit.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.600
Min Ji.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.800
This idea, did it come out of your own head?

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.370
I thought of it from Woo Tae Ho's point of view.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.900
When Jeong Hui Joo, who was special to him,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.550
was found not to be a victim of a serial murder case,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.800
what would he have thought?

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.050
He was a prosecutor, so he probably tried to find the motive for her murder first.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.820
We just need to find and follow the road that Woo Tae Ho found.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:28.020
Right, but would these people easily give us the information?

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.510
I thought being a dad would change a person.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.370
You're the same.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.330
You'll do anything to take me down.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.820
Okay.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.460
Did you think my seat would become yours if you did that?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.890
I mean, do you think Father would choose you?

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.050
The idea that we're a family. You're the only one who feels that way.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.480
- I know.
- You know? If you know, just accept what we give you

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.990
instead of being greedy and having it all taken back.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.880
I'm always grateful that I'm being taken care of.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.220
That's why Tae Ho and I cleaned up after you.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.400
But you screwed up again.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.240
I'm just taking the initiative to solve that problem for you.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.110
Do you think I don't know you?

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.930
Laugh?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.740
You want to avenge your mother

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.770
because you think your mother died because of me.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.060
It was Mom's choice.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.930
Instead of living in hell, she thought dying would be better.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.710
That's the same thing.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.730
By the way, I'm curious. Why is it?

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:02.680
Why are you suddenly showing your true self when all you did was hide things until now?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.180
Did you get the confidence to steal what is mine?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.190
But Na Na,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.720
you can't.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.820
Even if things turn out for the worse for me,

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.790
I won't let you steal it away from me.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.570
Even if I'm dead,

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.710
you can't.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.330
You can't.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.240
You

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.210
are exactly like your mother.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.650
The way you live.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.970
Yes?

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.500
Okay. Show them everything they want.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.670
Yes, Director. I understand.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.600
What information do you want?

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.820
Is there security footage that Woo Tae Ho requested?

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.140
Yes. We have it saved.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.340
This is it.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.450
After Woo Tae Ho gave the safe password to Jeong Hui Joo,

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.120
he made her slip out that laptop.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.040
This laptop

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.560
must've had something he didn't want the prosecution to see.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.410
It probably includes the lost CCTV footage

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.380
from Cheon Sang Woo's assault case from two years ago.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.340
That's why, on that day, Jeong Hui Joo...

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.410
That footage, should I send it to Director Cheon?

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.370
I think the chairman would see it if I did that.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.420
Aren't you more afraid of them than the police?

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.540
What is this?

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.470
Can you come here for a moment, please?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.860
This. Could you identify the person taking the picture?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.150
Mr. Park Seong Ok, over here.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.040
What can I do for you?

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.990
I'm Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Police Station.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.840
Here. Did you take this photo?

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.650
Who ordered you to take the photo?

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.670
Well. That's...

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.310
You told Team Leader Woo Tae Ho that Chairman Cheon Sang Woo instructed you to do it.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.880
Chairman Cheon Sang Woo ordered you

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.510
to find evidence of an affair between Team Leader Woo Tae Ho and Jeong Hui Joo, right?

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.660
Chairman Cheon Sang Woo already knew of their relationship.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.150
What is it that you want? Money?

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.020
Or do you want me to divorce Woo Tae Ho and put him in your arms?

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.020
Cheon Sang Woo, that person came to my store one time.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.340
Also, when I recently met him, I noticed him by the dress shoes he was wearing.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.020
What did he say while he was here?

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.930
He said really bad things about Hui Joo.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:31.070
I thought about it later, and I think he already knew of Hui Joo and Woo Tae Ho's relationship.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.710
He was the person who sent the photos to Hui Joo, right?

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.240
Yes, he was.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.820
But then why did he even come to me to find out about Hui Joo?

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.490
What about your grandfather, who owns a shoe store?

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.890
He didn't seem so well.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.280
What are you saying right now?

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.000
I was just thinking your grandfather might see hell first...

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.290
Hui Joo showed me the security footage of the assault case from two years ago,

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.920
instructing me to get my child back using that.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.240
If Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo refused,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.090
she said she'd take it to the police herself.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.670
So...

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.600
Woo Tae Ho kept the security camera footage of the Cheon Sang Woo assault case on his laptop,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.910
and Jeong Hui Joo, who checked the content of that, instead of giving it to Cheon Sang Woo,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.880
showed it to Kim Min Ji and threatened Cheon Sang Woo with it.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.500
So Cheon Sang Woo killed Jeong Hui Joo? Is that about the gist of it?

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.300
On top of that, Jeong Hui Joo knew about another of Cheon Sang Woo's incriminating weak points.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.970
And if the chairman knew why you assaulted Min Ji

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.330
he would be even more disappointed in you.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.170
She learned that Cheon Sang Woo had an illegitimate child with Kim Min Ji.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.770
In the view of Cheon Sang Woo, who was trying to become the next CEO,

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.510
there was a need to stop Jeong Hui Joo from talking.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.260
Isn't that basically revealing Cheon Sang Woo's motive for committing the crime?

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:05.540
Eventually, the video Cheon Na Na showed you was a huge help.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.040
Well, I guess so.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.490
But there is one thing that's bothering me.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:12.620
What?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.730
What's bothering you now?

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.570
Why did Woo Tae Ho die?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.770
By any chance, the video that you showed me, did you ever show it to Woo Tae Ho?

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.040
No.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.580
That's possible.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.600
Because you didn't trust Team Leader Woo Tae Ho.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.220
Was the video I showed you useful?

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.580
Yes.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.340
I think it's enough to find the murder motive.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.500
You're capable.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.080
If Team Leader Woo Tae Ho was alive, even if I hadn't seen that video,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.820
the motive for murder would've been revealed.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.060
Team Leader Woo had already discovered Cheon Sang Woo ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.810
However, to prove that fact, he himself had to admit the fact that he and Jeong Hui Joo had an affair.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:07.070
If not, the motive couldn't have been explained clearly.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.500
He was probably ready to reveal that.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.870
But why, in the car, after seeing the photo that you showed him,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.320
did he think that he had to die?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.640
If he learned that my brother was the culprit,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.810
and if I knew that too,

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:36.350
would there be a reason for me to release his seat belt to get him killed?

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:42.780
If he went to you guys and told the truth, I'd be sitting in the seat my brother is in right now.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.930
Why would I?

Let's solve it together.

The thing that Woo Tae Ho is hiding, did you find it out?

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.330
The team leader is not hiding anything.

No.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.630
There is something.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:40.430
Somewhere, he probably has our company's and our entire family's weaknesses collected.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.090
That's his power.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.430
Why would he let a person like me know?

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.770
Because you're the only one that he trusts.

we have arrested Team Leader Choi from the legal team of a conglomerate and are continuing our investigation.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.630
For what reasons was the suspect identified as the culprit?

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.570
From the car that was dumped

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.870
and the found lipstick lid that was used in the murder.

between him and the suspect who ordered the murder.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.150
You said it's a conglomerate legal team leader.

By any chance, are you speaking of TJ Group, where the victim used to work?

I'm sorry. We can't tell you that.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:51.400
So, what you're saying is that the person who ordered the murder has a motive.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.410
Has the motive been revealed?

00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:56.110
We're investigating.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:01.100
Not long ago, there was an incident where Team Leader Woo Tae Ho of the legal department died in a car accident.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.600

as a suspect related to the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.980
However, doubts still remain.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.770
This is due to the fact that there is a high possibility that scapegoating behavior,

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.460
often found in investigations of conglomerate entities, could be at work here.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.020

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.950
Gi Dong Jae and Choi Yong Geun.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.840
With this amount of evidence, I don't think there'll be any problems maintaining the prosecution.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.060
Good job. Let's finish this off quickly.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.270
There's still a lot to investigate.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.050
- What?
- The person who ordered the murder is not Choi Yong Geun.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.960
- Then who?
- Choi Yong Geun only helped Gi Dong Jae dump the body.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.370
The real culprit is Cheon Sang Woo.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.660
- You have evidence?
- There's no direct evidence, but the motive for the murder has been clearly revealed.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.840
So you're saying that all you have is circumstantial evidence. Let me speak openly and bluntly.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.560
The murder case, yes, the detectives need to keep digging until the end.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.370
However, if you keep digging and lose at the trial?

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.340
I mean, if the suspect were just a simple citizen, they'd just drink away their frustrations if they got released.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.380
However, the opponent is a conglomerate chairman. A chairman of a conglomerate.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.820
How are you going to deal with the aftermath? Not only for me but for you. No,

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:01.590
everyone around you; all of them will be swept away.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.050
We're confident that we'll win even if we go to trial─

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.570
Are you a prosecutor?

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:08.340
I'm the one at the trial!

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.830
The chairman has instructed us to gather a team of lawyers.
[Attorney's office]

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.040
We are currently in contact with a retired lawyer from the high prosecutor's office,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.950
as well as a lawyer who used to be a police officer.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.410
The trial will be held in the most favorable environment possible.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.670
I see. So then, it's all down to me to do a good job.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.840
Yes, that's right.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.290
I see.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:37.310
Not so long ago, a gangster I know said this.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:42.110
That the only tool that he had was honesty.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.430
I feel like I'm in his shoes now.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.080
Go to the chairman and tell him

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.010
to be careful because we don't know when Choi Yong Geun will be using his tool.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.710
And to never do anything to provoke him.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.940
I heard you met with Prosecutor Cha. What did he say?

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.500
Well.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.980
It's obvious. "Let's just stop at Choi Yong Geun."

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.960
I'm right, aren't I?

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.090
Prosecutor Cha is a guy who has been denied a promotion to chief prosecutor countless times.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.110
It's about time he leaves prosecution work. However,

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.650
why, out of all the prosecutors, would they have sent someone like him?

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.130
They're giving him a chance.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.710
They're saying, "Come to TJ after leaving work as a prosecutor."

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.570
"Even if you take on just a few cases related to TJ, you'll get billions of won every year."

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.150
If you were a prosecutor, would you prosecute Cheon Sang Woo?

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.770
What's the use of working so hard?

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.460
The prosecutor won't do his job.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.580
Currently, the team leader position of the legal team is empty.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.740
As you know, it's the seat the former team leader Woo Tae Ho was in.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.080
Joining TJ right after a TJ case is over.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.700
Isn't that a bit much for others to see?

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.790
Well, go abroad for a year or two and get some fresh air.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.820
We'll take care of all the fees.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:16.010
Well, recently, my wife has been making a fuss about moving to Gangnam for the children's education─

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.710
You should go. You've suffered enough.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:24.900
My first child is really bad at studying. So I think I'll need to send him to study abroad.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:30.190
Well, if you'd like, we will support you the best we can.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.040
Well, let's see. How should I put it?

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.230
I'm a bit lonely these days.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.790
Get me a mistress.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.960
- Sure.
- Is what I'm saying so funny?

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:54.150
I was a regular prosecutor for twenty years. It's too late for me to climb up the ladder.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.490
It is about time for me to leave,

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:02.120
but I just need a little more than a prosecutor's salary.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.440
Would that be easy?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.310
You're telling me to choose? Go all in or go home?

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.830
If the choice is too hard, you can just wash your hands of this case.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.420
This case... There are many prosecutors who can take it on.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.340
My, this is hard! Right?

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:36.610
Let's continue. There's no reason for me to step on shit on the way out.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.570
You should take the easy way out. You've suffered enough, right?

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.640
Let's walk down that flowery path.

In the Oh Choong Sik case, you and I─

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:11.160
Did the police ever exert undue pressure? Or, have you suffered something that may have violated human rights?

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.930
No.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.990
Okay.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.410
That's good.

Yes. You got Choong Sik!

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.340
Yes! I arrested him the hard way.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.880
Hey, take him.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.610
Good job.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.280
Where did you catch him to look like that?

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.690
I caught him at a wedding hall.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.760
Your own wedding, by any chance?

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.630
Well, yeah, what can I do? I saw him!

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.800
How can I persuade this crazy detective?

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.400
There needs to be something in common for me to dig in.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.800
Let's go down the flowery path. Flowery.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.920

Hey, we should differentiate between public and private affairs.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.440
But I understand her point of view.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.110
Her sister's family's life is on the line, so what would public and private life matter?

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.680

There's a dead victim, and the victim's family suffers in pain.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.520
How can we change the direction of the investigation for something like that?

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.160
That can't happen, and shouldn't happen.

You lived without thinking things through.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.240
Now you want to die the same way?

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.240
I'm sorry.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.260
Were you really going to kill yourself?

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.760
Huh?

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.460
Okay.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.520
Let's just say that you died.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.310
Let's say that you're starting over from your first step,

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:47.870

Please live a new life!

00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.820
Okay.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.610
I'll live like that, Dong Wook.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.550
Thank you.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.240
Thank you.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.930
You should've at least went to the sauna before coming here.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.930
We can't go to the sauna like this. It would be a nuisance.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.070
We're sorry.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.540
We'll clean up the dirt we tracked in before leaving.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.560
It's one chicken per person. I ordered ahead of time.

Wow, what is this now?

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.060
Wow.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.800

we're missing two draft beers.

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:10.000
Detective Byeon and Ji, you shouldn't drink when you just got out of the hospital.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.070
Instead of beer,

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.640
I'm fine now. The doctor said I could have a glass of beer─

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.280
Just drink it.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.060

Really, I'm a lifetime fan of yours.

Team Leader Woo's wife gifted it to suggest that you do the investigation right.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.900
Bong Sik, earlier, your wife─

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.280
I know, I know. My wife told me all about it.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:53.090
She has nowhere to go and rant, so she just comes to Eun Hui to vent, so don't worry about it too much.

Today,

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.740
Dong Wook's brother almost died.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:04.090
If he died so futilely, Dong Wook's life would've been ruined too.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:09.410
They... My boy and my boy's brother were both almost killed.

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:12.110
Even though I've lived

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.860
as a pushover my whole life,

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.640
I can't accept this at all.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.640
We need to destroy them.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.740
We can't leave things as they are.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.970
Even if we die trying to climb higher and higher,

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.140
let's grab that star from the sky, just once.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.280
Here.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.330
Star in the sky?

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.200
- Let's get it!
- Let's get it!

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:54.100
You must be busy. Why did you want to see me?

00:51:54.100 --> 00:52:00.110
To be honest, the group's image is not the best at the moment.

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:05.460
So to improve the image, we intend to invest heavily in public service.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.950
That's good. That's what we want.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:13.040
But now that I'm actually the chairman,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.470
there's quite a lot to consider.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.330
So Secretary, if you would help us,

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:26.990
I think I would be able to focus more on public service.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.540
I don't think that's something I can take care of.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.210
I was hoping this wouldn't be your personal favor.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:40.050
Too bad. I guess that's it for today.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.280
Your father-in-law's business is going well, yes?

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:50.350
The thing is,

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.800
when changing the subcontractor,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.500
it was a bit much for Woo Tae Ho to decide on his own.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.340
Choosing such a business was a bigger risk.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.640
It was pretty clearly a quid pro quo

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.300
for the family of a certain public official.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.260
Do you know what the difference between you and Woo Tae Ho is?

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.800
You attack the weakness directly,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.780
but Woo Tae Ho informs the opponent of their weakness, and helps fix it.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.880
You make the opponent into an enemy,

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.570
but Woo Tae Ho makes the opponent into a friend.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.830
You

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.750
made me into an enemy.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.890
Aigoo.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.610
What? This isn't something to be congratulated on.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:02.950
I just took on a troublesome murder case.

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:04.900
Are you crazy?

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:08.750
Why would you ask me to hook you up as the TJ lawyer? Sir?

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:14.450
Sir? The only TJ person I've seen recently was the service center worker that came to fix my refrigerator.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:15.950
Yes, Deputy Chief?

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.010
Yes.

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:21.110
Well, the case is a bit more complicated and tangled up, so within that time─

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.210
Yes.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.250
Yes, well, I'll try my best. Okay.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.380
I mean, why is the deputy chief prosecutor getting involved in Incheon office business?

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.780
Does he think I'd be bowing at his feet because it's TJ?

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.560
Come on in.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.500
Hello.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.950
- What is it?
- We've revealed something new.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.160
This is the phone record of Gi Dong Jae that we obtained.

00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:01.130
And this is the record of the burner phone that Chairman Cheon Sang Woo used a while ago.

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:05.200
It's evident that Cheon Sang Woo and Gi Dong Jae talked on the phone before Jeong Hui Joo was murdered.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.470
Circumstantially, it's clear that Cheon Sang Woo ordered Gi Dong Jae to carry out the murder at that time.

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.350
Was the conversation recorded?

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:15.420
No. It wasn't, but...

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.700
So it's just more circumstantial evidence. Anyway, that's that.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.080
So what about the evidence that Cheon Sang Woo used that burner phone?

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.580
He threw away the burner phone in the park,

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.910
and it was confirmed that Chairman Cheon Sang Woo was caught on the park CCTV.

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.830
That's also circumstantial evidence!

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:34.010
If it wasn't recorded, a fingerprint or saliva or something should have been found on that burner phone!

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.710
I'm telling you to bring thorough evidence!

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.330
Isn't this enough reason to request an arrest warrant?

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:45.620
Even if you requested it, you wouldn't get the warrant, but also, the moment I asked a judge for a warrant,

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.720
there would be a different lawyer sitting here.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.970
I expected it, but he's pushing back hard.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.970
I don't think it'll work in the future, either.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.440
If we can't get an arrest warrant, we should try sending in a subpoena.

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.590
Would Cheon Sang Woo come?

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.860
If he doesn't come, we can make an urgent arrest after the subpoena.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:08.210
We have to summon him before Choi Yong Geun gets sent to the prosecution and do a cross-examination.

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.300
Only then would Cheon Sang Woo's name come out of Choi Yong Geun's mouth.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.420
A cross-examination would be even more difficult.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.830
They wouldn't allow it.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.540
We just need to do non-face-to-face.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.270
Non-face-to-face?

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:24.340
Why did you meet with Secretary Heo Gong Seo?

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.550
The media was making too much noise, so I told him to help clear that up.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:36.230
Did you think he'd say "Yes, sir" if you pushed like that?

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.080
He's the Secretary for Civil Affairs at the Blue House.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.580
He's the one with the knife.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:45.420
You've let go of the reins that Woo Tae Ho was already barely holding onto.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.530
Why are you

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.840
talking about Tae Ho again?

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.390
That guy only looked capable because he had TJ supporting him.

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.450
He would've been nothing if he wasn't the son-in-law of TJ.

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:02.970
Would you be in this place if Tae Ho was around?

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:06.050
As if getting some girl killed was such a big crime!

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:11.160
- Father.
- This is not about whether you're guilty or not. It's about pride.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:16.880
TJ shouldn't have been ruined just because we're missing Tae Ho.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.310
I'm sorry.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:22.940

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.980
I think you can come in now.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:14.610
Check once more, including the area around the station, and once you're done, contact us immediately.

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:16.400
Okay, understood.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.850
After another check, we'll go in if everything is fine.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:26.850
How much evidence related to me have the police secured?

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:32.430
While it's not something to be ignored, most of it is circumstantial evidence and nothing concrete.

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:35.210
What about what is related to Choi Yong Geun?

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.670
The charges against Gi Dong Jae and Choi Yong Geun are clear.

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.660
There's quite a good amount of solid evidence.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.970
I think it'll be hard for him to get away.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.270
Okay.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:49.740
Yes.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.950
We're going in.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.160
[A warm and trustworthy police force for the people]

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.520
Wow, he's making quite an entrance.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.810
We should go meet him. The chairman is here.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:21.380
[A warm and trustworthy police force for the people]

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:25.930
Welcome.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.840
I'm Kang Do Chang from the Incheon West Violent Crimes Team 2.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.960
I look forward to working with you.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.880
We refuse any recording of this testimony.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.460
Sure.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.940
We'll stop then.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.970
You go far back with Mr. Choi Yong Geun, right?

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.880
In return for covering up the Kim Min Ji assault case from two years ago,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.870
you brought Choi Yong Geun into the legal team, right?

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.120
Choi Yong Geun used to be a detective.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.490
He's a master at covering up a case.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:05.100
We've already discovered how Choi Yong Geun manipulated the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:13.180
But if Choi Yong Geun doesn't reveal who was behind it, he will become the final suspect.

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:23.980
Regarding the fact that the employees of our company are involved in a murder case;

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.780
I feel sorry about that.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.550
By any chance,

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:32.780
did the murdered Jeong Hui Joo threaten you?

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.830
Jeong Hui Joo knew a lot of your secrets.

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:42.380
Things that were related to the assault case from two years ago,

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:45.440
and things related to Kim Min Ji, who was the victim.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.320
Using that as bait,

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.530
she threatened you, isn't that right?

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.630
Well, that's─

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:57.780
I'm sorry, but if your lawyer gets involved in this interview, it could work quite disadvantageously at trial.

01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.610
Are you okay with that?

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:13.090
To tell you the truth, Jeong Hui Joo didn't tell me directly,

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.230
but I had an idea.

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:19.790
So you're saying Jeong Hui Joo demanded something from you, right?

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.450
So,

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:25.520
how did you react to that demand?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.360
How did you respond?

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.210
I discussed it with Team Leader Choi Yong Geun.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:45.160
"One of your team members is making strange demands."

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.150
"Persuade her so this won't happen again."

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:54.550
That's all I said to Choi Yong Geun.

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:59.430
Then, when Jeong Hui Joo was murdered, you must've known that it was Choi Yong Geun's doing.

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:03.980
I didn't know at first, but rather, later on.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:12.410
When I discovered that Jeong Hui Joo wasn't a victim of that serial killer, I became suspicious.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080
However,

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.240
I didn't even imagine

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.420
that Department Leader Choi Yong Geun would've killed her.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.370
So, what you're saying is, "Choi Yong Geun,

01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:29.840
when you didn't even order him to, on his own accord,

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.570
killed someone."

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.430
Is that what you mean?

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:41.270
Cho Yong Geun instigated Gi Dong Jae, who he knew back when he was a detective,

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.900
to murder Jeong Hui Joo cruelly.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:49.860
And you're saying that was simply because you ordered him to persuade her?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.310
Jeong Hui Joo was

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:04.000
a very bad type of woman.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.270
She had many men.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.830
She was sleeping with her department lead, Choi Yong Geun, too.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:18.670
But then, when Jeong Hui Joo started to like Woo Tae Ho, he became jealous.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.370
Probably my order

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:26.210
became the excuse for doing that to Jeong Hui Joo.

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:38.410
This is the dash cam screen of the car of Gi Dong Jae, who is suspected of murdering Jeong Hui Joo.

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:43.820
Due to an accident, the dash cam was kept at the traffic department.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:49.990
The woman you see ahead is Gi Dong Jae's girlfriend, and at the time, Gi Dong Jae was in the passenger seat.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.150
Yes?

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.190
Jeong Hui Joo?

01:06:56.190 --> 01:07:00.160
I mean, if you suddenly order such...

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.700
Okay.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.440
I'll call back after discussing with Department Leader Choi.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:14.500
Someone told him to carry out the murder.

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:18.590
"Kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo."

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:24.100
"I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations,

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.200
so kill that bitch!"

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.950
"Department Lead Choi will take care of the rest,

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.080
so Gi Dong Jae,

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.600
all you need to do is kill her!"

01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:44.220
"Do you understand?"

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.980
♫ Seeking out prey on loose, I am the night ♫

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.470
♫ Show yourself all night long ♫

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:07.600
♫ My sweet one, let's not play. Come on, oh oh oh ♫

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.830
♫ Come join me, it's a feast ♫

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:14.960
♫ I know you want to ♫

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.960
♫ I'll make this night just ♫

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.170
~ Preview ~
How was it? Meeting my brother in person.

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:21.590
He was ruder than I thought.

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:25.170
There's definitely a bug or a camera hidden somewhere. Check thoroughly.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:28.780
I said, you can never. Never!

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.500
The warrant for Cheon Sang Woo's arrest has been approved.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.950
- Everyone's opinion points towards one thing.
- Woo Tae Ho?

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:35.950
Are you saying that Woo Tae Ho could actually be the culprit, as they're claiming?

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:38.870
I heard that there's a high possibility of Chairman Cheon Sang Woo being released.

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.890
There's no way to prove it right now.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.220
You know you can't win against me.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.420
Die!

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:56.410
