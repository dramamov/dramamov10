00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:41.790
All attention will be on you, CEO Oh.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.134
You need to prepare for that.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:46.520
Yes, I expected this,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.000
but I'm not sure how to prepare─

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.891
Just hold out.

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.076
It will be over soon.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.551
I won't ever have to stand in court, right?

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.515
I'll make sure you don't.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.859
I'm depending on you two.

[Jeonghan Daily News]

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.644
Let's not go.

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:42.650
Why not?

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.050
I think he's on to us.

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:52.886
Call the rest of the team and tell them not to go home and to come to the office instead.

00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:57.648
I'll be there around 23:00 (11:00 pm).

00:01:57.648 --> 00:01:58.911
Yeah.

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.469
Thanks.

00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.485
I heard her dad is a death row inmate who killed two people.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:08.767
And what? She's not the one who killed people.

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.937
But it still makes me uncomfortable.

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:14.078
How could she have been raised well by a father like that?

00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:15.526
I don't like the way she looks at me.

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:19.313
You just have a prejudice against her. It's because she had a hard life.

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.037
Did you...

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:22.265
do her wrong?

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:23.835
Do her wrong?

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:24.893
Why would I do that?

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:27.967
Then why are you doing something you've never done before?

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:30.551
It's because I lack male hormones. Why?

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.382
I'm losing all my hair and male hormones because you stress me out.

00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:39.200
And I cry all the time because of you, you wench.

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:41.921
Damn it!

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.834
What's with him?

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.525
Yes?

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:06.747
Do you like the room?

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:10.946
Here.

00:03:10.946 --> 00:03:12.585
Fruits.

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:27.244
The bed is a little old,

00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:31.044
but it should be better than the hospital bed.

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:35.191
The mattress is still holding up.

00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:37.282
You can save my dad, right?

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.459
He didn't kill anyone.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.183
You know that too, Ahjussi.

00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:47.259
I will do everything... I can.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.117
If...

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:54.222
my dad gets executed,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.313
who am I supposed to blame for that?

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:07.389
My dad told me to think of him as someone who never existed.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.816
How can I do that?

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.866
He's the one who raised me.

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.469
He's my dad.

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:18.828
Your dad is still alive.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.806
I'm the one who put the handcuffs on your dad.

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:28.400
And the one who can take those cuffs off

00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:31.650
is also me.

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:48.610
You said you had something to tell me about Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:57.280
Lee Dae Cheol was sentenced to death for killing a college student and a detective.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.376
The college student's name was Yoon Ji Seon.

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:01.033
She was an art student.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:04.906
It was revealed that she painted a portrait for someone around the time of her murder.

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:10.350
And circumstances show that the person in the painting may be the one who killed her.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.538
Who is it?

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:15.819
Oh Jong Tae, the CEO of Incheon Investment Trust.

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:19.450
Do you have proof?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.176
The alibi that Oh Jong Tae gave to the police was fabricated.

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:23.932
And?

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:28.290
We have evidence that Lee Dae Cheol was somewhere else at the time of the murder.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.937
Both are circumstantial evidence. They can't directly prove it.

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:34.008
The investigation and trials were processed with false evidence.

00:05:34.008 --> 00:05:37.424
I think this is enough to request a retrial.

00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:38.985
A retrial.

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:40.219
Do you think it will be easy?

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.009
It's going to be hard,

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.109
and even more so if Oh Jong Tae is the real killer.

00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:48.798
He's one of the wealthiest men in Incheon.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:51.056
He'll use his influence in politics, the legal system,

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:53.414
and the police to stop it from happening.

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:54.816
And...

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.187
even the press.

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:00.703
Someone told me this.

00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:07.733
The most effective way to bury the truth is to have the suspect disappear forever.

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.592
There was an attempt to kill Lee Dae Cheol in prison,

00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:12.640
and it failed.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.385
Soon after, there was suddenly an order for executions,

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:17.385
which we haven't seen in the last 20 years.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:21.513
If the goal of the execution was to get rid of Lee Dae Cheol,

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:25.797
and if the real killer is behind all of it,

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.890
it would've been impossible for an average person to pull it off.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.481
But it would be possible for Oh Jong Tae.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.064
I know Oh Jong Tae too.

00:06:40.064 --> 00:06:42.176
He has power.

00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:45.218
And he helped my brother during the election.

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:50.167
But he's still just a man with power in the province.

00:06:50.813 --> 00:06:54.656
An execution order is a national matter that needs the president's approval.

00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:58.956
Do you think he has enough power to move the president?

00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:01.664
If your reasoning is correct,

00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:03.920
then the real killer isn't Oh Jong Tae.

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:08.717
It should be someone with much more power than him.

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:19.933
Yes, Detective Oh?

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.133
Right now?

00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:27.656
Okay.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.011
That's Yoo Jeong Seok, senior manager of Jeonghan Daily.

00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:37.083
And his brother is

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:39.267
Congressman Yoo Jeong Ryeol.

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:42.580
He's also being considered to become the next attorney general.

00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:52.805
I won't ever have to stand in court, right?

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:54.981
I'm depending on you two.

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:05.377
He has a senior manager of Jeonghan Daily News and the next attorney general on his side?

00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:08.336
This is making my head cramp up.

00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:10.656
Jong Tae showed it to us on purpose.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:15.080
He was showing off his power with the people he was meeting.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.860
Hey.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.048
What are you doing instead of letting the guys go home?

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:28.297
Hyeongnim, I don't think this is right.

00:08:28.297 --> 00:08:31.281
To be honest, isn't this a personal case for you?

00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.306
Right?

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:33.436
What?

00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:35.500
- What's wrong with you?
- Let go.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.448
I'm right.

00:08:37.448 --> 00:08:38.963
Hyeongnim.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.023
Let's just go catch Joo Dong Pal.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.821
That's our job.

00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:49.612
Why are you taking these innocent guys and working them into the ground?

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.033
Hyeongnim.

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:54.163
We're doing this because we want to.

00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:55.997
Yeah, of course.

00:08:55.997 --> 00:08:57.820
You guys need to wake up!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.883
Things won't go well for you even if you solve the case!

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:02.662
Look at me.

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:04.243
I'm begging you.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:08.723
If you have even an ounce of conscience left

00:09:08.723 --> 00:09:11.017
just let the guys go.

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:13.985
Don't ruin their lives too!

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:16.720
Hyeong, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.012
The representatives of police? Aigoo.

00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:24.546
Just be honest and say you're picking the suicide squad instead.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.410
I mean, why...

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.360
What's up with him?

00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:36.640
Jae Hong isn't wrong.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.728
You can decide for yourselves.

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.406
- Oh Ji Hyeok.
- Yes?

00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:44.985
Can you show me the proof of the CCTV footage being fabricated again?

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.309
Sure.

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:48.966
The rest of you can go home.

00:09:48.966 --> 00:09:50.323
Thanks for your work.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.663
Why are things so complicated?

00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:53.869
It's simple.

00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:57.485
We'll get fired if we help Do Chang.

00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:59.736
Fire us on what basis?

00:09:59.736 --> 00:10:01.479
We're national public servants.

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:06.070
Even if they can't fire us, they'll send us to the outskirts.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.340
But we'll still get paid.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.250
But you won't get to advance in your career!

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.601
I wouldn't have joined violent crimes if I was thinking about advancing my career.

00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:15.534
You're right.

00:10:15.534 --> 00:10:18.582
- Isn't that Jae Hong over there?
- Where?

00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:23.959
Is that bastard trying to drive after drinking?

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:26.018
I've told you multiple times!

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:28.871
Kang Do Chang is chasing Joo Dong Pal right now!

00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:30.227
Think about it.

00:10:30.227 --> 00:10:33.801
What good will it do for him if he touches Lee Dae Cheol's case?

00:10:35.087 --> 00:10:36.287
Hey!

00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:38.784
I'm not your slave!

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:42.359
Forget it. Do whatever you want!

00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:53.899
This is humiliating.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:57.893
How the hell did my life turn out like this?

00:10:57.893 --> 00:11:01.335
Damn it, I'm not done paying this off.

00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:13.763
You must have gotten a call from Yoon Sang Mi.

00:11:13.763 --> 00:11:16.132
Yoon Sang Mi from the auditing department.

00:11:16.132 --> 00:11:19.137
I can't believe this.

00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:32.909
Let's request a retrial

00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:34.368
before it's too late.

00:11:34.368 --> 00:11:36.959
You're right, considering the situation.

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.861
But we don't have enough time.

00:11:38.861 --> 00:11:42.679
Even if you prepare for years, the chances of winning in a retrial are slim.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.913
But we have to do everything we can. We have no other choice.

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:51.196
Detective Kwon said earlier that things wouldn't go well even if we solved the case.

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:52.623
He's giving us the facts.

00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:54.982
Are you two going to be okay with that?

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:57.148
The worst that can happen to me is getting fired.

00:11:57.148 --> 00:12:01.282
but the worst that can happen to Lee Dae Cheol is dying.

00:12:01.282 --> 00:12:04.142
Which one do you think I should choose?

00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:13.987
Be honest.

00:12:13.987 --> 00:12:16.484
Yoon Sang Mi has something on you, doesn't she?

00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:22.711
- Hyeong, did you...
- What?

00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:23.611
What? What?

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:24.990
What are you asking him?

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.314
Sim Dong Wook.

00:12:26.314 --> 00:12:28.020
What are you thinking?

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.844
We heard him on the phone earlier.

00:12:30.844 --> 00:12:33.046
Why do you think he would talk about Do Chang?

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:34.998
Yoon Sang Mi must have told him to report─

00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:36.222
Hey, idiot!

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.094
You don't even know Jae Hong!

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:43.251
Do you know how much he actually respects Do Chang?

00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:46.080
What are you going to do if Dong Wook is right?

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:52.223
- What if he's right?
- What is up with you?

00:12:52.223 --> 00:12:54.923
What are you talking about?

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:59.248
Think about it.

00:12:59.775 --> 00:13:06.212
Who do you think will remain on this team longer? Will it be Do Chang or me?

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:21.937
Thanks.

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:24.891
Did you tell your superiors about it?

00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:26.915
About our work?

00:13:26.915 --> 00:13:28.368
Yes, I did.

00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:32.076
Even your senior manager who was meeting with Oh Jong Tae?

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:33.723
Of course, I did.

00:13:33.723 --> 00:13:35.212
He's my immediate supervisor.

00:13:35.212 --> 00:13:36.936
They looked close.

00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:40.160
He wouldn't like it if we went after Oh Jong Tae.

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:45.612
It won't be good for you to be on his bad side.

00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:48.393
That's right.

00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:50.341
You're right.

00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:57.245
I just got a position at the headquarters, and now I'm going against the senior manager?

00:13:57.245 --> 00:14:01.370
And this case will annoy the prosecutors, police, and the judicial branch.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.259
If I get on their bad side, they won't give me a

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.278
story to write about for the rest of my life.

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:07.445
It will end my career.

00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:11.640
Why am I risking my whole career just for one story?

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.405
Aren't I such an idiot?

00:14:14.405 --> 00:14:16.502
This is crazy.

00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:22.304
Can you find out if Jo Seong Dae is really working for Kim Gi Tae and

00:14:22.304 --> 00:14:26.338
if Kim Gi Tae knew about Oh Jong Tae?

00:14:26.338 --> 00:14:28.872
I can't believe you.

00:14:28.872 --> 00:14:32.484
I just told you that I'm doing a stupid thing!

00:14:32.484 --> 00:14:34.039
Find it out for us.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:37.213
Detective Oh. Detective Oh!

00:14:38.264 --> 00:14:41.930
As you said, I think Lee Dae Cheol is innocent.

00:14:42.606 --> 00:14:46.391
But we don't have clear evidence because it's such an old case.

00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:50.040
Things would be so easy if just one person chose to speak.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:53.461
Can you help me?

00:14:53.461 --> 00:14:55.222
Help with that?

00:14:55.222 --> 00:14:57.203
Jo Seong Dae.

00:14:57.203 --> 00:14:58.671
You two are close.

00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:00.940
Didn't he tell you?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.324
I guess he didn't tell you about killing Park Geon Ho and his attempt to kill me.

00:15:07.232 --> 00:15:09.867
The police are looking into who he's working under.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:14.790
But I first met Jo Seong Dae because of you.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.039
- Jo Seong Dae?
- Yes, Jo Seong Dae.

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:22.383
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- You sent him to me.

00:15:22.383 --> 00:15:27.718
Oh, from when I asked my nephew to bring you here.

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:30.669
I guess he sent him instead because he was busy.

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:35.394
I'll ask my nephew later about who Jo Seong Dae is.

00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:37.235
Sir.

00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:40.764
I told you about Lee Dae Cheol's innocence with pure intentions.

00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:44.314
Well, I can't say it was all pure.

00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:48.456
You will stand on the witness stand when my trial starts.

00:15:48.456 --> 00:15:52.741
And I wanted the witness to have a good image of me.

00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:54.550
That's all.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.923
Shouldn't you have told me first if you had found out who the real killer was?

00:16:03.923 --> 00:16:07.112
We still need to investigate further.

00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:09.271
So, who is it that you're investigating?

00:16:09.271 --> 00:16:13.792
It's not the man that you told me about.

00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:19.095
But wasn't your final goal a specific person?

00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:26.981
If you'd like, I can stop things here.

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:39.300
Aigoo. Detective Kang, I've never handled a retrial.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.896
And I'm not confident I can win.

00:16:40.896 --> 00:16:43.921
In addition, the execution is right around the corner.

00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:47.753
Do you think they'll accept a retrial during such a sensitive time?

00:16:47.753 --> 00:16:52.901
And I'm not brave enough to handle such a big case.

00:16:52.901 --> 00:16:54.842
Attorney So.

00:16:54.842 --> 00:16:59.222
I'm the one who locked up Lee Dae Cheol.

00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:03.157
A detective who arrested the suspect is requesting

00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:06.285
a retrial to prove the suspect's innocence.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:11.831
I'm shooting myself in the foot right now.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.567
He's doing something crazy.

00:17:15.466 --> 00:17:16.174
So why?

00:17:16.174 --> 00:17:20.074
Everything will be fine if I just keep my mouth shut. I know that.

00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:23.676
But if I keep silent too,

00:17:24.786 --> 00:17:27.200
no one can speak for him.

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:37.592
A painting is very different from a photo.

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:39.537
A painting holds emotion.

00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:43.280
Because a person is looking at another person while they paint.

00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:45.948
What do you see in me?

00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:48.822
Anger?

00:17:48.822 --> 00:17:52.580
It seems like you're very angry at something.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.944
And you look sad.

00:18:22.074 --> 00:18:25.443
I'll hand the phone to the lawyer. You can talk to him yourself.

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:27.467
Hold on.

00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:29.701
- It's Go Joon Seop.
- Okay.

00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:31.552
Hello?

00:18:31.552 --> 00:18:34.547
Hi, this is Attorney So.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:41.101
Yoon Ji Seon's friend is the one who told us.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:44.954
How many witnesses do we have right now?

00:18:44.954 --> 00:18:46.022
Go Joon Seop,

00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:48.346
Yoon Ji Seon's friend...

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:24.489
[Lee Dae Cheol's Retrial Files]

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:30.091
No matter how I work around it, the conclusion doesn't change.

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:34.990
There's no proof that Oh Jong Tae is the killer.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.047
And there's no proof that Lee Dae Cheol isn't the killer.

00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:44.142
A retrial requires a lot more particular conditions than a regular trial.

00:19:45.427 --> 00:19:47.083
This is going to be hard to win.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.598
- But we have a witness.
- Go Joon Seop?

00:19:49.598 --> 00:19:53.189
But it's not like he witnessed the actual murder.

00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:55.620
- A police officer.
- A police officer?

00:19:56.583 --> 00:19:58.693
The witness that the judges find most credible

00:19:58.693 --> 00:20:00.833
is the detective in charge of the case.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:03.733
What if that detective testifies?

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:09.824
You're telling me to walk into a fire with a gas tank in my hand.

00:20:13.825 --> 00:20:15.628
Sure, why not.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:20.448
Kang Do Chang is busy chasing after Joo Dong Pal right now.

00:20:20.448 --> 00:20:21.897
It's a stunt.

00:20:21.897 --> 00:20:25.837
From what I know, he's reinvestigating Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:20:25.837 --> 00:20:26.617
Why?

00:20:26.617 --> 00:20:28.279
You know this from working with him.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:32.970
Once he thinks he's right about something, he just goes for it.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.293
He has changed a lot. He's not like how he used to be.

00:20:36.293 --> 00:20:42.242
You know that I'm auditing Detective Kang, right?

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.409
He came to see me recently.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:47.380
I wonder why that happened to that person back then.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.106
How come something that looked like a coincidence

00:20:49.106 --> 00:20:52.857
now looks like it had a hidden motive?

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:59.203
I'll probably have to just do my job against a close colleague of mine soon.

00:20:59.203 --> 00:21:03.261
What he was referring to was...

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:09.379
He's talking about when I lost the murder weapon and you found it.

00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:11.521
When he said he was going to do his job,

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:15.670
he meant that he will have to reveal what happened

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.362
between us if he reinvestigates the case.

00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:20.512
If my mistake back then comes to light,

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:23.559
my career will take a huge hit.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:29.751
And won't you get some backlash for finding the murder weapon?

00:21:34.137 --> 00:21:37.704
What do police officers do if they retire early?

00:21:37.704 --> 00:21:39.698
Become private investigators?

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.745
That's a little dirty.

00:21:41.745 --> 00:21:43.523
Private bodyguard work?

00:21:43.523 --> 00:21:46.134
That's hard labor too.

00:21:47.035 --> 00:21:48.902
Your age will be a problem.

00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:53.580
My age won't be an issue.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.841
I can get a young guy to do the work for me.

00:21:56.841 --> 00:21:58.598
- Who?
- I have someone.

00:21:58.598 --> 00:22:00.600
He forced me to walk into a fire.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.665
I'm going to drag him with me all the way to hell.

00:22:28.176 --> 00:22:32.275
Why would Yoon Sang Mi be here at this hour?

00:22:32.275 --> 00:22:36.050
She came by herself to do what and see who?

00:22:44.833 --> 00:22:47.733
Don't answer it. Just hold on to it.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.680
[Moon Sang Beom]

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:06.718
Give me that.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.799
I'm chasing after the suspect right now.

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.104
Why are you calling...

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.170
Hey!

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.491
Stop right there! Bastard!

00:23:24.692 --> 00:23:27.230
Let's go get Joo Dong Pal. It's about time we get him.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.795
Let's go.

00:23:31.027 --> 00:23:32.469
Who is it?

00:23:32.469 --> 00:23:35.508
Yoo Na, it's me.

00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:36.945
What?

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:40.261
You don't have anywhere else to sleep again?

00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:41.868
You need to pay me.

00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:43.813
You're crazy.

00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:49.899
You told the cops about me, huh?

00:23:53.364 --> 00:23:55.897
Hey. Hey!

00:23:57.917 --> 00:23:58.710
What?

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.037
Hong Doo is going to kill me.

00:24:01.037 --> 00:24:02.086
Why would he kill you?

00:24:02.086 --> 00:24:05.574
I got won over by that cop and handed him Hong Doo's number.

00:24:05.598 --> 00:24:08.082
Ah, Eonni, please help me!

00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:09.183
Where are you?

00:24:09.183 --> 00:24:12.002
You know this place... that place...

00:24:12.002 --> 00:24:14.356
The empty house where we had my birthday party.

00:24:14.356 --> 00:24:16.215
Hong Doo is going to find me soon.

00:24:16.215 --> 00:24:20.372
Can you stay with me and try to talk to him when he gets here?

00:24:20.372 --> 00:24:23.685
He's going to beat me to death if I'm by myself!

00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:26.538
This is all because I was trying to help you.

00:24:26.538 --> 00:24:29.042
Please, Eonni!

00:24:29.042 --> 00:24:31.355
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:37.534
Where are you going?

00:24:38.293 --> 00:24:41.793
Detective Kang told me not to let you out at night. Don't go.

00:24:41.793 --> 00:24:43.544
It's not like I'm locked up in prison.

00:24:43.544 --> 00:24:46.344
You don't want to come back, huh?

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:54.661
Let's say that you ran away without me knowing.

00:24:54.661 --> 00:24:57.295
Won't that work better for both of us?

00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:29.808
- You guys ate, right?
- Yes.

00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:31.734
Let's do this.

00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:33.360
Where is Joo Dong Pal?

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.957
He'll be here soon.

00:25:34.957 --> 00:25:37.900
He can't live without women.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.357
He'll head to his girl's house after having some drinks.

00:25:41.357 --> 00:25:44.058
Why call us here if it's that easy?

00:25:44.058 --> 00:25:48.202
I don't want to do all the hard work. I want to see you guys suffer.

00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:51.880
He's here.

00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:56.076
Let's go.

00:26:03.004 --> 00:26:04.837
Who are those bastards?

00:26:04.837 --> 00:26:06.810
Aren't they from Gwangju?

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.157
Damn it.

00:26:08.157 --> 00:26:10.780
Joo Dong Pal!

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.950
Run!

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.610
- Hey, you bastard!
- Get him.

00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:15.918
Stop right there, bastard!

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.573
Where do you think you're going?

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.910
Ji Hyeok!

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.490
Ji Hyeok!

00:27:01.496 --> 00:27:03.479
Hey! Ji Hyeok!

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:05.807
Ji Hyeok! Ji Hyeok!

00:27:05.807 --> 00:27:08.302
Get him for me!

00:27:56.754 --> 00:27:58.454
Move!

00:28:27.621 --> 00:28:29.321
Where is it?

00:28:29.989 --> 00:28:31.889
Hold on.

00:28:32.676 --> 00:28:34.476
- Jae Hong.
- Here!

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.710
- Darn it!
- Got him.

00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:44.960
- Go back home.
- Enough now.

00:28:55.543 --> 00:28:58.246
You guys came such a long way.

00:28:58.246 --> 00:29:02.440
Anyway, thanks for helping us out.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.090
Good work!

00:29:08.098 --> 00:29:10.861
You should go eat.

00:30:15.342 --> 00:30:17.342
What are you doing here?

00:30:18.246 --> 00:30:20.213
Did you call her here?

00:30:21.973 --> 00:30:26.047
She brings bad luck. She hangs out with cops.

00:30:26.047 --> 00:30:29.735
What were you two planning?

00:30:29.735 --> 00:30:31.871
- Answer me.
- Stop it.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.543
Hey, just looking at your face pisses me off.

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:38.592
Hurry and get lost.

00:30:38.592 --> 00:30:42.013
I asked her to do it. You can hit me instead.

00:30:42.013 --> 00:30:44.574
What a good friend you have.

00:30:44.574 --> 00:30:46.993
Look at that loyalty.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.523
You two take her and teach her a lesson.

00:30:50.523 --> 00:30:52.145
She made my nose bleed.

00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:54.140
- Make sure she's almost dead.
- Okay.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.240
Eonnie!

00:30:55.264 --> 00:30:56.864
Stop it!

00:30:56.864 --> 00:30:59.227
I don't want to see her anymore.

00:30:59.227 --> 00:31:00.786
I said stop!

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.622
Get her out of here!

00:31:03.622 --> 00:31:06.322
This is all your fault!

00:31:20.256 --> 00:31:21.856
Let her go.

00:31:21.856 --> 00:31:23.947
I said let her go.

00:31:47.974 --> 00:31:51.652
Let's just take four of your gang with us.

00:31:51.652 --> 00:31:54.971
You'll be lonely if you go in by yourself.

00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:58.788
Just give us four people that you're not close with.

00:31:58.788 --> 00:32:01.200
Hey, attention, Divisions 1 and 2!

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.280
Attention, attention.

00:32:05.373 --> 00:32:07.401
Good work!

00:32:09.896 --> 00:32:11.776
Who was the one who cuffed him?

00:32:11.776 --> 00:32:13.371
Kwon Jae Hong.

00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:17.161
I had no idea Jae Hong was that fast. He was quick like lightning!

00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:19.020
You should've seen him!

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.561
Hey, he usually moves slowly, but when he sees a suspect, he turns into Usain Bolt (famous Jamaican sprinter).

00:32:24.561 --> 00:32:26.171
He was born to be a detective.

00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:27.498
What is up with you guys?

00:32:27.498 --> 00:32:30.979
Hey, no need to be modest.

00:32:30.979 --> 00:32:32.482
You know my principles.

00:32:32.482 --> 00:32:37.351
I will definitely catch those who blame others for their mistakes.

00:32:37.351 --> 00:32:43.197
And I will definitely reward those who do something great.

00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:47.747
I didn't do it alone.

00:32:47.747 --> 00:32:48.971
You're right.

00:32:48.971 --> 00:32:51.339
You don't catch a suspect alone.

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:54.390
You guys finally did something great.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.924
Your team is the best.

00:32:57.924 --> 00:33:02.520
Go team!

00:33:09.068 --> 00:33:10.677
What if she dies?

00:33:10.677 --> 00:33:12.810
Don't worry. She'll wake up.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.118
Oppa, what are you going to do about me?

00:33:16.118 --> 00:33:18.693
- You're a good actress.
- I know, right?

00:33:18.693 --> 00:33:21.093
This makes up for everything, right?

00:33:22.678 --> 00:33:25.211
Don't put on an act in front of me, or I'll kill you.

00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:29.168
Of course! What do you take me for?

00:34:10.365 --> 00:34:12.741
Let's just say you ran away without me knowing.

00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:15.274
Won't that work better for both of us?

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.710
[Pork]

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.000
- Fighting!
- Cheers!

00:34:53.014 --> 00:34:55.116
- Are you done writing up the report?
- Yes.

00:34:55.116 --> 00:34:56.546
Good work. Let's go inside.

00:34:56.546 --> 00:34:58.270
Hey.

00:34:59.209 --> 00:35:00.609
Here.

00:35:02.357 --> 00:35:04.057
Thank you.

00:35:04.057 --> 00:35:06.744
Come on, let's go inside.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.657
The man of the hour is here!

00:35:09.657 --> 00:35:11.466

My precious baby!

- He'll now take a shot!
- Hong! Hong! Hong!

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.210
Take a bite.

00:35:51.217 --> 00:35:53.130
Chase it with that.

00:36:01.568 --> 00:36:04.335
Jae Hong, sit in the center.

00:36:04.335 --> 00:36:07.110
He doesn't like that.

[Retrial Application]

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.520
Excuse me,

00:36:58.529 --> 00:37:01.973
but I didn't request for a retrial. Who did it?

00:37:01.997 --> 00:37:07.194
Detective Kang from Incheon's West Police Department came to me.

00:37:08.365 --> 00:37:10.221
Why would he do that?

00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:16.587
I believe Detective Kang is acknowledging that the investigation didn't go right.

00:37:17.404 --> 00:37:19.269
Really?

00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:20.850
Yes.

00:37:23.467 --> 00:37:25.233
Would you like to go for it?

00:37:26.154 --> 00:37:29.216
Do you think a retrial is possible?

00:37:29.216 --> 00:37:32.111
Do you think the judge will accept it?

00:37:32.111 --> 00:37:33.721
Please be honest.

00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:39.258
I've seen many inmates prepare for a retrial,

00:37:39.258 --> 00:37:42.152
but I've never seen them get accepted.

00:37:42.152 --> 00:37:44.799
It's not totally impossible.

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:51.554
The detective who arrested you is admitting that he made a mistake.

00:37:51.554 --> 00:37:52.792
Now he is?

00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:57.317
He didn't believe a word I said back then when I told him it wasn't me.

00:37:57.317 --> 00:37:59.598
And he's admitting it with the execution right around the corner?

00:37:59.598 --> 00:38:02.298
He's trying to save me now?

00:38:02.298 --> 00:38:03.996
It's bullshit.

00:38:04.803 --> 00:38:07.405
If I die, he'll tell himself that there's no need

00:38:07.405 --> 00:38:09.850
to feel guilty because he did all that he could.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.201
He's just doing this to make himself feel better.

00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:16.116
I won't ever forgive him.

00:38:16.116 --> 00:38:17.878
Never.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.357
- Please sign the form.
- No.

00:38:24.357 --> 00:38:26.398
You need to have your revenge.

00:38:26.398 --> 00:38:31.966
If the retrial is accepted, Detective Kang won't be able to work as a detective anymore.

00:38:31.966 --> 00:38:34.414
Do you think the police and prosecutors will leave

00:38:34.414 --> 00:38:36.636
him alone after he has revealed their mistake?

00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:38.612
He knows that, too.

00:38:38.612 --> 00:38:40.086
But the fact that he's still doing it

00:38:40.086 --> 00:38:44.002
must be because he wants to feel more at ease as you said.

00:38:44.002 --> 00:38:46.319
Or else, it doesn't make sense.

00:38:46.319 --> 00:38:50.026
So you should sign it,

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:58.227
and tell the whole world what he did to you when you stand in court.

[Lee Dae Cheol]

00:39:20.467 --> 00:39:24.400
I'm a lawyer, but I don't fully trust the laws.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.927
I think my distrust will only grow more if you get executed.

00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:36.433
Eun Hye has no money and nowhere to go!

00:39:36.433 --> 00:39:38.401
She's sick too!

00:39:38.401 --> 00:39:40.002
How can you kick her out?

00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:43.213
I didn't kick her out! She walked out of here on her own!

00:39:43.213 --> 00:39:45.303
She left because you made her feel uncomfortable!

00:39:45.303 --> 00:39:46.960
What do you want me to do?

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.882
Was I supposed to beg her to stay?

00:39:48.882 --> 00:39:50.413
She's just a kid!

00:39:50.413 --> 00:39:54.491
Don't you get worried as a mother with a son if a kid doesn't come home?

00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:58.646
My heart is rotting since my son was taken away. Who am I supposed to worry about?

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:01.035
Then you should've called me at least!

00:40:01.035 --> 00:40:04.676
She's the one who said that she's not locked up in prison.

00:40:04.676 --> 00:40:07.787
Do you think you can take care of her?

00:40:07.787 --> 00:40:12.177
She's probably reminded of her dad in prison every time she looks at you.

00:40:12.177 --> 00:40:16.072
You may be a hero to the victims' families,

00:40:16.072 --> 00:40:20.696
but you're a villain to the suspects' family.

00:40:46.943 --> 00:40:48.975
She's not answering my calls.

00:40:48.975 --> 00:40:51.541
Can you try calling Eun Hye?

00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:53.890
I'll give her a call later.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.960
Why did you take her to your house?

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.349
Well, I have a lot of rooms at my house.

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:04.332
What are you going to do if Lee Dae Cheol ends up getting executed?

00:41:04.332 --> 00:41:07.053
You're going to just live with her?

00:41:07.053 --> 00:41:10.990
I haven't thought about that yet.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:16.826
You'll have nightmares every night as you look at Eun Hye.

00:41:16.826 --> 00:41:18.504

Hey! Why do you always try to teach me a lesson or something?

00:41:27.147 --> 00:41:30.780
Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself─

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.772
Got it.

00:41:31.796 --> 00:41:33.889
I think he's talking to the judge.

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:37.655
Yes, I'll look into it and send the supplementary files.

00:41:37.655 --> 00:41:39.171
Bye.

00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:41.593
Lawyer So, what did the judge say?

00:41:41.593 --> 00:41:44.423
He's asking why I'm doing this with the execution right around the corner.

00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:46.718
He's asking if we have an ulterior motive.

00:41:46.718 --> 00:41:48.318
What ulterior motive?

00:41:48.318 --> 00:41:53.091
We're just asking for a retrial because Lee Dae Cheol isn't the real killer.

00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:56.142
I think he just called as a formality.

00:41:56.142 --> 00:41:58.111
It's such a sensitive issue

00:41:58.111 --> 00:42:01.772
that he's protecting himself in case he dismisses it.

00:42:01.772 --> 00:42:04.944
So he's expressing that he's going to dismiss it.

00:42:04.944 --> 00:42:08.679
We can't have a retrial if the judge doesn't accept it.

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:10.079
Damn it.

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:15.894
I told him I'd send more files for the retrial, so let's do all that we can.

00:42:17.232 --> 00:42:24.182
But is there anything else that can work as grounds for having a retrial?

00:42:27.554 --> 00:42:30.469
This is really embarrassing.

00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:36.219
This is humiliating for the police to admit,

00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:42.808
but we lost the murder weapon in Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:42:42.808 --> 00:42:49.240
We found it again, but the murder weapon was missing for about an hour.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.990
Was the murder weapon chosen as evidence during the trial?

00:42:56.014 --> 00:43:00.227
The evidence could have been tampered with.

00:43:01.693 --> 00:43:03.168
Why didn't you mention it?

00:43:03.168 --> 00:43:08.683
At the time, I was so sure that Lee Dae Cheol was the killer.

00:43:11.865 --> 00:43:16.329
Man, we're at a big disadvantage.

00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:18.563
We don't have time at all.

00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:21.204
It's the same for the other side too.

If the news about Lee Dae Cheol's retrial becomes public,

00:43:23.563 --> 00:43:28.399
the ones who decided on the execution will try to take care of it before the day of the execution.

00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:31.685
Then we'll still have a chance at having a retrial.

00:43:31.685 --> 00:43:33.285
Right.

00:43:33.285 --> 00:43:38.260

You think this will change the judge's mind?

00:53:20.503 --> 00:53:23.387
I looked into the judge, and it's going to be a hard fight.

00:53:23.387 --> 00:53:27.097
An elite judge who scored at the top 10% on his exams.

00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:31.264
A judge takes that record for the rest of their career.

00:53:31.264 --> 00:53:34.722
A man like that won't be persuaded easily.

00:53:34.722 --> 00:53:37.044
Maybe he'll listen to God.

00:53:37.785 --> 00:53:45.137
The Catholic Peace Committee, which has been calling for the abolition of executions, is holding a silent protest

00:53:45.137 --> 00:53:51.491
asking that executions be abolished and that Lee Dae Cheol receives an immediate retrial.

00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:09.402
Yes, sir, it's me.

00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:13.807
I have a favor to ask.

00:54:13.807 --> 00:54:16.118
We have breaking news.

00:54:16.118 --> 00:54:20.001
Today, at midnight (12:00am), the Supreme Court accepted Lee Dae Cheol's request for retrial.

00:54:20.001 --> 00:54:23.500
The Supreme Court has ordered the Seoul High Court to hold a retrial.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.448
People are waiting to see what results the first retrial

00:54:27.448 --> 00:54:31.404
will bring with the impending execution.

00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:35.470
You heard the news, right?

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:38.165
We made the impossible happen.

00:54:38.165 --> 00:54:41.470
Holding a retrial is hard, especially with an impending execution.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.709
You could be an actor, Detective Kang.

00:54:43.709 --> 00:54:46.456
You were a natural in front of the camera.

00:54:46.456 --> 00:54:50.823
We're going to look for work with the film industry after this.

00:54:50.823 --> 00:54:52.384
Why are you dragging me into it?

00:54:52.384 --> 00:54:56.142
I realized that you're a genius when it comes to scamming people.

00:54:56.142 --> 00:54:59.861
You can write the script, and I'll act. Don't you think it will be a hit?

00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:01.144
You can be the villain.

00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:02.636
A villain that curses a lot.

00:55:02.636 --> 00:55:06.041
A villain's role won't suit me. A detective role is perfect for me.

00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:08.430
There are a lot of bad detectives too.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.299
So you've thought of me as a bad detective, huh?

00:55:11.299 --> 00:55:15.568
I'm just talking about the way you look.

00:55:15.568 --> 00:55:17.237
What's wrong with the way I look?

00:55:17.237 --> 00:55:21.414
You're the one who looks like a con artist.

00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:23.079
Stop smiling, you brat.

00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:24.741
Aigoo, come on.

00:55:24.741 --> 00:55:27.688
We haven't won the case yet.

00:55:27.688 --> 00:55:29.034
This is just the beginning.

00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:30.437
The beginning is very important.

00:55:30.437 --> 00:55:33.081
And I think the press is on our side too.

00:55:33.081 --> 00:55:34.626
Isn't the beginning part going well?

00:55:34.626 --> 00:55:40.562
If I were the judge, I wouldn't have accepted this retrial.

00:55:40.562 --> 00:55:43.707
He only accepted it because of the press.

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:47.484
The evidence that we provided isn't strong enough.

00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:49.206
Well, we'll work on it─

00:55:49.206 --> 00:55:51.315
You know we don't have much time, right?

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:55.739
We need to decide on the direction of the trial first.

00:55:55.739 --> 00:56:00.393
We'll put more emphasis on Yoon Ji Seon's case than on Jang Jin Soo's.

00:56:00.417 --> 00:56:05.683
If he's found not guilty for Yoon Ji Seon's case, we will be able to stop the execution order.

00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:11.352
And what is most important is that we have to prove the investigation was handled poorly.

00:56:11.352 --> 00:56:17.903
We have to put the focus on police corruption, coercion, and a poorly handled investigation.

00:56:17.903 --> 00:56:23.366
You know that all depends on what you say, right?

00:56:23.366 --> 00:56:24.949
I'll do everything I can.

00:56:24.973 --> 00:56:27.254
We have to win.

00:56:30.989 --> 00:56:33.522
So you've agreed to have this retrial.

00:56:33.522 --> 00:56:36.152
A cabinet reshuffling will be announced soon.

00:56:36.152 --> 00:56:39.385
There's no reason to take on a risk early in my term.

00:56:39.385 --> 00:56:42.646
I need to get rid of it before my term begins.

00:56:42.646 --> 00:56:45.262
The opposition party is already preparing for a hearing.

00:56:45.262 --> 00:56:49.616
They'll make a big deal about Oh Jong Tae.

00:56:50.526 --> 00:56:55.991
I need you to meet with him again before my appointment to get his word.

00:56:56.692 --> 00:57:01.034
To be honest, I don't trust him.

00:57:01.034 --> 00:57:03.964
Okay, I'll take care of it.

00:57:03.964 --> 00:57:06.024
Just say the word.

00:57:06.024 --> 00:57:08.829
I just need to lay low, right?

00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:13.929
If I do need to step in, you can tell me what to say.

00:57:13.929 --> 00:57:18.027
I'll make sure I don't go off-script.

00:57:18.027 --> 00:57:21.601
I'll let you know when the hearing is held.

00:57:22.254 --> 00:57:29.540
Is Congressman Yoo involved in any way with Lee Dae Cheol's retrial?

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.331
Why are you curious about that?

00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:33.173
Just wondering.

00:57:33.173 --> 00:57:36.773
The legal department decided on it because of the press.

00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:43.826
But I think there may have been some influence from a powerful man.

00:57:44.403 --> 00:57:47.262
The current attorney general doesn't have any power.

00:57:47.262 --> 00:57:52.209
All the power is already with the next attorney general.

00:57:52.209 --> 00:57:55.808
So the person who can make a decision about that is...

00:57:58.059 --> 00:58:04.126
I don't know why you're so curious about that, but I can tell you one thing.

00:58:04.126 --> 00:58:09.585
The one who opens the door is the one who can also close it.

00:58:13.497 --> 00:58:16.930
Well, I look forward to working with you

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:19.818
so that neither of us gets hurt.

00:58:24.933 --> 00:58:28.087
I just don't get it.

00:58:28.087 --> 00:58:31.600
What grounds do they have to hold a retrial?

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.345
Who is supporting Lee Dae Cheol?

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.878
I don't know.

00:58:37.878 --> 00:58:40.137
That's what I would like to know, too.

00:58:40.137 --> 00:58:43.099
He doesn't have anything.

00:58:43.099 --> 00:58:47.082
I think he sent letters from prison.

00:58:47.082 --> 00:58:50.676
I think the Catholic groups are moving because of that too.

00:58:51.481 --> 00:58:56.504
A retrial has already been decided, so we can't do anything about that.

00:58:56.504 --> 00:59:01.724
We three are the only ones in this division, who were involved with the case.

00:59:01.724 --> 00:59:07.656
I can take care of myself, but you two be sure to keep your mouths shut.

00:59:07.656 --> 00:59:12.361
Don't do an interview no matter how much the reporters beg you.

00:59:12.361 --> 00:59:16.604
Don't hand over any files, even if the lawyer requests them.

00:59:16.604 --> 00:59:18.871
We don't have any left anyway.

00:59:18.871 --> 00:59:22.241
The court might call for you, but don't show up.

00:59:22.241 --> 00:59:24.532
It's not illegal to not show up.

00:59:24.532 --> 00:59:26.763
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

00:59:27.903 --> 00:59:32.856
If... things go south for us at the retrial,

00:59:32.856 --> 00:59:37.374
the people who were involved in the case will all go down like dominoes.

00:59:37.374 --> 00:59:39.415
We'll all be dead.

00:59:39.415 --> 00:59:40.742
Yes, sir.

00:59:41.372 --> 00:59:43.090
I know that.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:50.370
[Executive Conference Room, Chief's office]

00:59:50.372 --> 00:59:52.572
This sucks.

00:59:52.572 --> 00:59:56.390
Well, I'm sure you have more on the line than I do.

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.431
Want to grab some drinks?

00:59:58.431 --> 01:00:02.174
No, I'm not in the mood to drink.

01:00:02.174 --> 01:00:05.904
Did you visit Lee Dae Cheol, recently?

01:00:05.904 --> 01:00:06.866
Why would I go there?

01:00:06.866 --> 01:00:09.266
You're close with Lee Eun Hye.

01:00:09.266 --> 01:00:14.321
Didn't she ask you to save her dad because he's innocent?

01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:20.559
You bastard, why are you asking me that?

01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:24.222
Why are you getting so worked up?

01:00:24.222 --> 01:00:25.639
What?

01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:27.774
Is that what really happened?

01:00:33.098 --> 01:00:35.206
Team Leader Nam.

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:41.868
You came in after me, but you've advanced much further than me in your career.

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:47.231
Why would you worry about someone like me?

01:00:47.231 --> 01:00:53.390
I'll have to deal with the consequences regardless of how the retrial ends.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:59.351
Just take pity on me, and keep your damn mouth shut.

01:00:59.862 --> 01:01:01.896
You're good at that.

01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:04.395
And one more thing.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:07.340
If you mess with someone like me who has nothing to lose...

01:01:08.604 --> 01:01:10.607
You better behave.

01:01:11.409 --> 01:01:13.709
Who knows what I might do.

01:01:25.362 --> 01:01:27.788
That was scary.

01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:36.086
What are you guys still doing here?

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.120
Hyeongnim.

01:01:39.122 --> 01:01:40.490
What did the chief say?

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:43.031
Does he know that you were behind it?

01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:46.071
Don't let people know that you know about that.

01:01:46.071 --> 01:01:49.917
I'll ask for your help if I need it.

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:53.427
So if the chief asks, just say you don't know anything.

01:01:53.427 --> 01:01:55.479
You should go home. I'm going to head out soon.

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:59.152
You can go home. I need to take care of some things on my own.

01:01:59.152 --> 01:02:01.052
Got it.

01:02:08.122 --> 01:02:13.300
Lee Dae Cheol's retrial was possible because of Detective Kang and Detective Oh, right?

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.800
Yeah.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.499
Do Chang is awesome.

01:02:17.499 --> 01:02:19.316
No, he's not.

01:02:19.316 --> 01:02:23.144
It won't do Do Chang any good if Lee Dae Cheol wins the case.

01:02:23.144 --> 01:02:24.870
He'll only get on our superiors' bad side.

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.228
It's because he was embarrassed.

01:02:27.228 --> 01:02:31.173
He's doing this because he didn't want to feel embarrassed for the rest of his life.

01:02:31.173 --> 01:02:33.376
I get where he's coming from.

01:02:33.376 --> 01:02:38.327
I was about to live the rest of my life feeling embarrassed too. But Do Chang helped me.

01:02:38.327 --> 01:02:43.319
That's when I realized for the first time why I need to be a detective.

01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:47.484
Doesn't it feel like Do Chang is teaching us something right now?

01:02:47.484 --> 01:02:52.410
He's showing us that this is what it means to be a detective.

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:58.737
That was a really cool way to put it, huh?

01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:00.414
Yeah.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:02.240
So cool.

Just kill me instead! Why are you dragging my innocent Eun Hye into this?

01:04:14.237 --> 01:04:15.549
Why? Why?

01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:18.082
Tell me exactly what you did wrong.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.904
I'll talk to you at the station.

01:04:19.904 --> 01:04:22.163
Why would we need to go to the station? This is a crime scene.

01:04:22.163 --> 01:04:24.904
Did we get more evidence that shows Oh Jong Tae is the killer?

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:27.557
- Did your boss ask you to find out?
- My boss is not someone who would do that.

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:30.786
Have they found evidence that makes you look suspicious?

01:04:30.786 --> 01:04:32.418
You must've been in a great hurry.
