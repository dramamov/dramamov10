[Name: Jo Seong Dae | Registration number: 730311-108641]

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.740
[Recent record: Assault - August, 14 2012]

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:28.644
It looks like him, right?

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:37.226
Someone emailed me a CCTV footage of Lee Dae Cheol.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.545
They also sent it to the detective who was in charge of the case.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.735
The ruling would have been different if that

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:45.349
- evidence had been submitted at the trial four years ago.
- True.

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:50.428
Lee Dae Cheol's case gained a lot of attention at the time.

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:53.342
It was a game that the prosecutors had to win no matter what.

00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:58.443
There was no need to submit evidence that would have put them at a disadvantage.

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.564
But why is someone revealing the truth now?

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:09.114
It will only damage the reputation that they have built up.

00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:10.747
I don't know.

00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:13.438
Maybe it's because an innocent man is about to die.

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:15.904
Because of their conscience?

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:20.954
The article you recently wrote about a death row inmate's victims' families...

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.743
Did you do that on your own?

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.107
Someone ordered you to do it, right?

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:30.878
The press is only talking about Jo Byeong Gil.

00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:34.186
People don't even know that Lee Dae Cheol is getting executed.

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:37.653
The person who told you to write that article.

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:42.667
What that person wanted wasn't the execution of a serial killer like Jo Byeong Gil.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.809
What that person wanted was...

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:49.296
Lee Dae Cheol.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:53.764
Do you know what the most effective way to bury the truth is?

00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:58.603
Having the suspect disappear.

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:00.564
Forever.

00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:16.407
The article you recently wrote about a death row inmate's victims' families...

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:17.703
Someone ordered you to do it, right?

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.584
Reports about the execution are still off the record.

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:22.984
Let's be the first ones to do it.

00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:26.331
Go interview the families of the victims.

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:30.873
Can I drop you off where I picked you up?

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:32.373
Yes.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.214
How do you know the attorney general?

00:02:38.214 --> 00:02:40.803
I don't think you work at the prosecutors' office.

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:44.770
I have personal respect for the attorney general.

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:51.925
He was in prison in the Philippines for murder.

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:55.506
And he was a suspect in numerous crimes after he returned to Korea.

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:57.459
So he killed Park Geon Ho.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.421
But the question is, how did Park Geon Ho know who the real killer was?

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:05.330
The answer to that question will explain everything else.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.479
But Park Geon Ho is dead.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.524
There's a chance that he told someone before he died.

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:13.639
Who?

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.639
Lee Eun Hye.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.940
What does she have?

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.162
Is it serious?

00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:19.851
She has epilepsy.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:23.512
It's chronic but not severe enough to require hospitalization.

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:26.631
- Then why did you admit her?
- Just in case.

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:30.069
In case Park Geon Ho went missing, Lee Eun Hye would be the only one

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.582
who knew what he was thinking.

00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:36.329
People often tell you that you're kind of annoying, right?

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.673
I don't know.

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:40.404
They don't say it to my face.

00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:41.836
You're annoying.

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:43.736
So annoying.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.315
Are you feeling okay?

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:55.503
I heard you didn't eat the food here.

00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:58.676
Is there something you want to eat? I'll get it for you.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.404
Park Geon Ho was murdered.

00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:12.910
Has Park Geon Ho ever talked to you about the real killer?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.987
When you worked with Park Geon Ho, I'm sure you listened to him for a reason.

00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:22.757
Park Geon Ho was on your father's side.

00:04:22.757 --> 00:04:25.889
Shouldn't we find the one who killed him?

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:35.190
What's going on?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.011
It's nothing.

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:39.425
She's a patient.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.264
- You want to see?
- I guess it's nothing.

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:45.331
You can take a look if you want. She's a patient.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.827
Let's talk to her again when she calms down.

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:50.445
You should wait in the car.

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:53.740
She's not someone who can be persuaded with nice words.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.731
Do you want to see her having another seizure?

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:34.509
I don't know if you remember,

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:40.315
but I'm the one who arrested your dad five years ago.

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.131
Do you remember the bag of clementines that were

00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:53.250
on your dining table for a few days five years ago?

00:05:55.702 --> 00:06:01.135
When I transferred your dad to the prosecutors' office after the interrogation,

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:06.007
he hung on to me and told me that he just had one favor to ask.

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:12.739
He told me that his daughter's only joy comes

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.280
from playing games for an hour after school.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.680
And he told me that she always eats clementines when she does.

00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:24.336
He said she might throw them away if they were from him.

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:30.400
So he asked me to secretly put them on the dining table.

00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:41.062
At the time, I had zero doubt about your dad being the killer.

00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:44.467
But right then,

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.942
for a very brief moment,

00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:52.263
I thought that your father might not be the killer.

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.817
I...

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:06.254
I'm going to seriously look at the case again.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:10.645
To find out why that moment stopped me back then.

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:14.686
Eun Hye.

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:18.606
Your dad is

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.829
going to be executed soon.

00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:37.145
Did Eun Hye talk to you?

00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:39.392
What did she say?

00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:44.331
Lee Dae Cheol asked Park Geon Ho to do something for him.

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:49.893
It's good that you now know the truth too.
[ February 27, 2019]

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.363
What are you talking about?

00:08:52.363 --> 00:08:53.703
What do I have to know?

00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:56.275
I'm going to die anyway.

00:08:56.275 --> 00:09:01.464
Why do you think they asked you to kill me despite that?

00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:06.092
It means there's someone who wants me dead sooner.

00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:09.876
Let's make a deal.

00:09:09.876 --> 00:09:14.984
I'm never going to tell anyone what happened between us.

00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:19.245
In exchange, please tell my daughter, Eun Hye,

00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:22.270
that her dad didn't kill anyone.

00:09:30.345 --> 00:09:33.240
I'm begging you, Officer.

00:09:33.877 --> 00:09:35.887
Officer...

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.181
Is that your daughter?

00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:44.284
Yes.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:46.223
Where is she right now?

00:09:46.223 --> 00:09:49.150
I haven't seen her since I got arrested.

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:51.714
So she abandoned her father.

00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:53.361
I don't think she'll believe me then.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:57.236
She was my only treasure in life and the only reason I had to keep going.

00:09:57.236 --> 00:09:58.869
Eun Hye knows that too.

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:01.565
She's a very nice girl.

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:03.882
She'll believe me.

00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:30.126
Eun Hye believes that her dad is innocent.

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:33.231
Of course, she believes him. It's her dad.

00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:37.450
That explains why Park Geon Ho had to die.

00:11:37.744 --> 00:11:40.470
Yeah, I'll send over the address and name.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.172
I already know about his crime record.

00:11:42.172 --> 00:11:47.762
Find out what Jo Seong Dae has been up to, what he does, and where he usually goes.

00:11:47.762 --> 00:11:51.225
It's okay if it takes some time. Just get me the information.

00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:52.897
Thanks.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.900
Why are you drinking at home all of a sudden?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.579
We didn't come to drink. We came because we had nowhere else to talk.

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:02.961
I can't go to the station because I'm on vacation.

00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:07.137
And I wanted you to meet my new partner too.

00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:08.997
Hello.

00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:22.582
Why are you a detective when you've got such a nice and tidy appearance?

00:12:22.582 --> 00:12:26.693
There are a lot of detectives who look better than me these days.

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:29.440
Right, so why are you guys doing that?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.401
A detective should look a little messed up like him.

00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:36.495
Stop with the nonsense and go to your room. We need to talk about something.

00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:38.697
Don't drink too much. I bought these for myself.

00:12:38.697 --> 00:12:40.265
Go to your room.

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:42.970
I can smell the alcohol on your breath. You're embarrassing me.

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:44.846
Please just go to your room!

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.123
Damn it!

00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:49.407
She must be out of her mind.

00:12:50.314 --> 00:12:53.385
- Drink only one bottle.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.430
Want to drink?

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.093
No, I drove here.

00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:14.868
Do you remember when Park Geon Ho had a fake seizure inside the lockup?

00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:16.979
He knew about Eun Hye's illness.

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:19.080
He wanted to tell us about it.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.864
Tell us that Eun Hye is sick because of us.

00:13:22.864 --> 00:13:25.917
Why do you think Park Geon Ho was right in what he did?

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:27.939
I don't think what he did was right.

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:34.537
But I think I get why Park Geon Ho believed that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent.

00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:38.538
Do you think Lee Dae Cheol is innocent?

00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:41.773
Isn't your opinion more important than mine?

00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:43.990
What do you think?

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.502
I've believed that Lee Dae Cheol was guilty until now.

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:51.788
But I'm going to erase that from my mind starting now.

00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:55.645
I'm going to go back as if I'm seeing the case for the first time.

00:13:55.645 --> 00:13:57.736
Lee Dae Cheol is neither guilty nor innocent.

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.703
What if he's found to be innocent?

00:14:00.703 --> 00:14:02.767
Then we'll have to save him.

00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:13.570
The person who told you to write that article.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.542
What that person wanted wasn't the execution of a serial killer like Jo Byeong Gil.

00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:21.057
What that person wanted was...

00:14:21.057 --> 00:14:23.058
Lee Dae Cheol.

00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:38.493
Senior Manager.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.063
Hey, you're here.

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:43.464
Is everything okay?

00:14:44.307 --> 00:14:46.311
Want some tea?

00:14:52.617 --> 00:14:54.122
Did something happen?

00:14:54.122 --> 00:14:56.821
- Let's have a seat.
- Okay.

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:01.338
Is it something bad?

00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:03.362
Reporter Jin.

00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:07.759
I think now I'll be able to keep the promise I made to you.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:11.263
You can report to this office starting tomorrow. Director's orders.

00:15:14.908 --> 00:15:17.925
The staff is probably going to give you a hard time about it.

00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:21.397
Yeah, I know that much.

00:15:21.397 --> 00:15:24.985
Why did you look so upset earlier?

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:28.714
You don't need to come here if you're okay with where you are now.

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:32.907
What the heck? Are you trying to take back the offer?

00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:36.498
All right, let's do this together.

00:15:36.498 --> 00:15:38.556
Okay.

00:15:38.556 --> 00:15:40.573
Shouldn't I buy you some drinks tonight?

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:42.571
I have something to tell you too.

00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:44.775
I already have plans.

00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:46.721
Then we can do it next time.

00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:50.200
No, you can join me.

00:15:57.175 --> 00:15:59.821
I bet it's hard for you these days.

00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:00.953
Excuse me?

00:16:00.953 --> 00:16:02.006
The article you wrote.

00:16:02.006 --> 00:16:05.792
I'm sure the people who oppose the execution had a lot to say to you.

00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:08.914
A reporter should handle that much as part of the job.

00:16:08.914 --> 00:16:11.370
Well, thank you anyway.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.978
Excuse me?

00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:16.824
The current government promised to abolish the death penalty

00:16:16.824 --> 00:16:19.176
as part of their campaign and will be able to keep their promise.

00:16:19.176 --> 00:16:22.652
The problem was inmates whose executions had already been ordered.

00:16:22.652 --> 00:16:26.732
We may have to keep a serial killer alive.

00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:29.000
In order to abolish the death penalty,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.257
the recent execution order was necessary.

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:34.656
And we needed to tell the people about the justification.

00:16:34.656 --> 00:16:38.279
So, that's why you needed my article.

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:40.620
Let me be honest.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.473
I will probably become the next Minister of Justice.

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:47.815
The abolition of the death penalty will occur while I'm in office.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:54.167
I had to get rid of the political burdens before my appointment.

00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:58.180
Senior Manager, it seems like you're the one who needs to buy the drinks, not me.

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:02.529
I get it. Family comes first.

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:04.984
Thanks for understanding.

00:17:04.984 --> 00:17:09.523
But you didn't need to tell me about your motive.

00:17:09.523 --> 00:17:12.123
You would've found out about it anyway.

00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:14.750
I wanted to tell you before you caught on.

00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:17.378
This is random, but—

00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:21.345
But isn't it the question you actually want to ask?

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:27.959
Is there something between you and the attorney general that I don't know about?

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:31.346
My brother and he share a past, not me.

00:17:31.346 --> 00:17:34.289
They have been rivals since they were in school.

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:40.595
They both thought they would have to drag each other down to be successful.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.729
Let's go for round two.

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:51.021
No, tomorrow is my first day at the headquarters.

00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:53.860
I can't show up hungover with a swollen face.

00:17:53.884 --> 00:17:56.690
All right, I'll see you at the office tomorrow then.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:10.875
But... Is my entrance to the headquarters a personal gift from you?

00:18:11.572 --> 00:18:15.997
We're not close enough to exchange gifts.

00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:18.936
Right?

00:18:18.936 --> 00:18:20.953
I'll see you tomorrow!

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.780
[Incheon West Police Station]

00:18:44.783 --> 00:18:46.692
The chief wants to talk to me.

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:51.220
He'll probably throw a fit about us going to the scene drunk.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.551
He might call you guys too.

00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:55.500
So let's get our story straight now.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:02.118
There's no need to tell the chief the exact reason why we ended up drinking.

00:19:02.118 --> 00:19:03.703
I'm going to tell him the truth.

00:19:03.703 --> 00:19:04.883
Come on!

00:19:04.883 --> 00:19:07.159
Detective Kang hasn't given up on this case either.

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:09.152
So I'm going to be confident and follow in his footsteps too.

00:19:09.152 --> 00:19:11.576
Damn it.

00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:14.379
Jae Hong, he'll hate us even more.

00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:16.463
We could all get replaced!

00:19:16.463 --> 00:19:18.235
I got it.

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:20.189
Just make sure you calm the chief down.

00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:22.313
I'm depending on you.

00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:27.945
Good luck.

00:19:27.945 --> 00:19:29.869
Sim Dong Wook.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:30.672
Yes, sir?

00:19:30.672 --> 00:19:33.027
I'm warning you.

00:19:33.027 --> 00:19:36.844
Don't think you can go against the team leader just because we do.

00:19:36.868 --> 00:19:39.301
You don't get to do that yet.

00:19:39.883 --> 00:19:41.666
Hey, Kwon Jae Hong.

00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:44.216
I talked to the patrols and they said Kang Do Chang

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:47.504
and Oh Ji Hyeok were already on the scene.

00:19:47.504 --> 00:19:50.593
Were they keeping in contact with Park Geon Ho?

00:19:50.593 --> 00:19:53.438
I don't think so.

00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:56.419
Then it doesn't make sense.

00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:59.482
Oh, I remember now.

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:02.211
This is a secret.

00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:08.938
But Do Chang saw Park Geon Ho getting murdered at that location...

00:20:08.938 --> 00:20:11.382
in his dream.

00:20:16.985 --> 00:20:18.427
Don't be rude!

00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:22.529
Team Leader, if you want to know who the killer is,

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:26.269
you should call Do Chang. He just became a shaman.

00:20:26.269 --> 00:20:28.658
He's really good.

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.622
He even walks on the blades of straw cutters.

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:45.855
Hyeongnim, your expression doesn't look like you're on vacation.

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:48.567
More.

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:49.776
Okay.

00:20:49.776 --> 00:20:50.840
I'm taking the picture.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.940
One, two, three.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.644
Detectives are allowed to drink too.

00:20:57.395 --> 00:20:58.919
There were many times when I had to report

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:01.970
to the scene while I was out drinking at night.

00:21:02.998 --> 00:21:07.505
But it's not like I don't understand where Team Leader Nam is coming from.

00:21:07.505 --> 00:21:09.829
A team leader needs to do that.

00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:11.891
And it was a murder scene.

00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:14.577
It's your fault for getting caught.

00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:15.534
I apologize, sir.

00:21:15.534 --> 00:21:19.885
Anyway, if Team Leader Nam keeps bringing it up,

00:21:19.885 --> 00:21:23.212
I'll end up having to do something about it as the chief.

00:21:23.212 --> 00:21:25.897
You get the position I've been put in, right?

00:21:25.897 --> 00:21:26.946
Yes, sir.

00:21:26.946 --> 00:21:30.441
It won't go as far as disciplinary action.

00:21:30.441 --> 00:21:35.691
If it goes that far, it will be difficult to manage all the other detectives.

00:21:35.691 --> 00:21:42.323
In exchange, your team will have to cooperate with Team Leader Nam on his investigation.

00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:45.543
If you do, Team Leader Nam won't raise the issue anymore.

00:21:45.543 --> 00:21:48.102
Yes, sir. Of course.

00:21:48.102 --> 00:21:52.035
I heard Kang Do Chang was on the scene too.

00:21:52.035 --> 00:21:54.109
Did he not tell you that I told him to go on vacation?

00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:55.087
No, he did.

00:21:55.087 --> 00:21:57.304
Is he still hung up on Lee Dae Cheol's case?

00:21:57.304 --> 00:21:58.366
No, that's not it.

00:21:58.366 --> 00:22:01.692
Then why was a guy who was supposed to be on vacation at the crime scene?

00:22:01.692 --> 00:22:03.589
Why won't he just take a break?

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.307
You see...

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.238

Wow.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.190
Of all things, I can't believe a detective is making up his own alibi.

Thanks.

Hey! He's got some gall.

No, it's not going to be easy.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:57.527
The fact that he's exposing himself like that

00:22:57.527 --> 00:23:01.458
means he's confident that he won't get arrested.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:30.703
Now that I think about it, you're right.

00:45:30.703 --> 00:45:32.613
What?

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.201
They're going to do the briefing for Park Geon Ho's case right now.

00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:43.255
Around 16:00 (4pm) on November 28th,

00:45:43.255 --> 00:45:48.274
Park Geon Ho was found dead at Haehwa apartments in Incheon.

00:45:48.274 --> 00:45:49.950
[Reliable police, safe nation]

00:45:49.953 --> 00:45:54.692
We have concluded that he jumped from the building, taking his own life.

00:45:54.692 --> 00:45:57.259
Did you find the reason for his suicide? Was there a suicide note?

00:45:57.259 --> 00:45:59.076
There was no suicide note.

00:45:59.076 --> 00:46:02.721
We think that his fear of getting locked up for what

00:46:02.721 --> 00:46:05.977
he recently did was the direct reason for his suicide.

00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:08.224
He was indicted without detention.

00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:11.421
In case of such a situation, would there be a reason to feel that kind of pressure?

00:46:11.421 --> 00:46:13.780
Park Geon Ho used to be a prison guard.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.155
He was afraid of being in prison with the inmates that he used to manage.

00:46:17.155 --> 00:46:19.661
Does the medical examiner agree with you?

00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:22.024
He has a wound on his thigh.

00:46:22.024 --> 00:46:25.180
But considering that the apartment was abandoned,

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.357
the medical examiner suspected that the wound could

00:46:27.357 --> 00:46:29.435
have come from a nail or other metal materials.

00:46:29.435 --> 00:46:30.964
Who is the medical examiner?

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:34.868
Why do you think he was found at an abandoned building?

00:46:37.174 --> 00:46:40.108
I've never seen such a fake investigation before.

00:46:40.108 --> 00:46:43.407
They're doing all they can to bury it.

00:46:43.407 --> 00:46:46.403
How can the police do that?

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:47.883
What will happen to Jo Seong Dae?

00:46:47.902 --> 00:46:49.878
If the case gets closed as a suicide,

00:46:49.902 --> 00:46:52.974
Jo Seong Dae will no longer be a suspect, right?

00:46:52.974 --> 00:46:54.175
I'll have to let him go.

00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:56.890
You can't let him go after what he did to me.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.839
The worst he can be charged with is blackmail.

00:46:58.839 --> 00:47:01.283
He could've killed me!

00:47:01.283 --> 00:47:03.011
He might try to do something to me again.

00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:06.462
Don't reporters and detectives have similar jobs?

00:47:06.462 --> 00:47:08.850
You should quit being a reporter if you can't take on those risks.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:11.296
Reporters don't have guns like detectives do!

00:47:11.296 --> 00:47:13.362
You don't look too happy.

00:47:16.457 --> 00:47:18.438
I feel bad, too.

00:47:18.438 --> 00:47:21.383
Had it been a murder case as you claimed,

00:47:21.407 --> 00:47:24.140
it would've been a good chance to raise my performance scores.

00:47:31.838 --> 00:47:36.635
Don't you think he's going too far, even if he got orders from above?

00:47:36.635 --> 00:47:39.730
I think he's deeply connected to the case from 5 years ago.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.180
He was the detective in charge of Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.949
And he was Detective Jang Jin Soo's partner.

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:47.283
He was his partner?

00:47:47.283 --> 00:47:48.822
Yes, I'm home.

00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:51.423
I got a little bit of sleep.

00:47:51.423 --> 00:47:54.183
I know where it is, so I'll take a cab there.

00:47:54.183 --> 00:47:56.620
Give me 30 minutes.

00:47:58.148 --> 00:48:01.514
After all you've gone through because of drinking,

00:48:01.514 --> 00:48:03.052
you're drinking again?

00:48:03.052 --> 00:48:05.739
Can't you just lock him up?

00:48:05.739 --> 00:48:06.669
You're a cop.

00:48:06.693 --> 00:48:08.612
I can only lock him up if he committed a crime.

00:48:08.612 --> 00:48:11.850
You can just frame him and lock him up.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.670
I heard other cops do it all the time. Why can't you?

00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:16.224
Do you really think what you're saying right now makes any sense?

00:48:16.224 --> 00:48:18.182
I talked to him on the phone earlier.

00:48:18.182 --> 00:48:21.491
I heard they are going as far as looking into his bank account to investigate you.

00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.577
And that's why he got pissed and filed the restraining order.

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:27.376
I didn't do anything wrong. Things just ended up turning out like that.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.560
I'm sure they're looking into you because you did something bad.

00:48:30.584 --> 00:48:34.739
So you can do something to lock him up too!

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:39.247
A cop can't even do that for his sister?

00:48:39.247 --> 00:48:41.534
Just drink up,

00:48:41.534 --> 00:48:43.972
and stop taking your anger out on someone else.

00:48:43.972 --> 00:48:45.739
Then what about me?

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:49.320
I can't see Jae Woong for the rest of my life?

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.328
I miss him.

00:48:52.009 --> 00:48:54.449
I want to touch him.

00:48:54.449 --> 00:48:59.710
It's driving me crazy! Please!

00:49:06.211 --> 00:49:10.228
That's all I can think about right now.

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.619
I'm sorry,

00:49:13.622 --> 00:49:16.120
but I can't do that.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.145
Police shouldn't do that.

00:49:19.145 --> 00:49:21.247
Ever.

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:29.305
Don't you think it's weird?

00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:32.588
He's dating his dead partner's wife.

00:49:34.228 --> 00:49:38.762
You can get attached when you're trying to comfort someone.

00:49:38.762 --> 00:49:43.184
I don't think Detective Oh agrees.

00:49:43.184 --> 00:49:49.035
Jang Jin Soo still chased after Lee Dae Cheol even after getting his alibi.

00:49:50.241 --> 00:49:52.384
It means someone paid him to do that.

00:49:52.408 --> 00:49:55.707
There's a high chance Nam Gook Hyeon was an accomplice as his partner.

00:49:55.731 --> 00:49:59.626
The two shared something with each other instead of with her dead husband.

00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:06.393
What?

00:50:06.395 --> 00:50:08.261
Look at everything.

00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:10.241
It's chaos. They're going through your desk right now.

00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:12.419
Did you do something again?

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:15.383
Hey! I thought you were only looking into Kang Do Chang!

00:50:15.383 --> 00:50:19.279
- Why are you looking at other desks?
- We're just following orders.

00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:22.207
The rest of the team is about to be investigated because of you!

00:50:22.207 --> 00:50:24.116
They're all clean, so they should be okay.

00:50:24.116 --> 00:50:28.649
I'm sure they'll find some crumbs if they look into everything!

00:50:28.649 --> 00:50:29.913
Okay.

00:50:29.913 --> 00:50:33.416
If they find anything, I'll take the blame for it. Don't worry.

00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:34.916
Yeah.

00:50:36.916 --> 00:50:39.474
That bastard.

00:50:40.216 --> 00:50:42.116
What's that about?

00:50:42.116 --> 00:50:45.746
All right, let's do it.

00:50:45.746 --> 00:50:48.661
I'll be sure to dig everything up.

00:50:48.661 --> 00:50:51.560
That damn bastard.

00:50:58.108 --> 00:51:00.108
Don't worry about it.

00:51:00.108 --> 00:51:02.945
It's okay since we have nothing to hide.

00:51:04.197 --> 00:51:06.363
It's humiliating.

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:09.106
Why are they only doing this to our team?

00:51:09.106 --> 00:51:11.664
Those bastards are the ones who are obviously corrupted.

00:51:11.664 --> 00:51:15.552
Why are they not doing anything to them and are only messing with us?

00:51:15.552 --> 00:51:18.500
They were just putting on a show.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.092
Why else would they take a whole hour to do this when it should only take ten minutes?

00:51:22.116 --> 00:51:24.588
They wanted the whole station to see it.

00:51:24.612 --> 00:51:27.616
They were just putting on a show to humiliate us.

00:51:27.616 --> 00:51:28.940
It's fine.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.687
Team Leader. It's suspicious.

00:51:31.687 --> 00:51:35.168
Why would they do this when Detective Kang is on vacation?

00:51:35.168 --> 00:51:38.437
And they forced the closure of Park Geon Ho's case too.

00:51:38.437 --> 00:51:43.473
Maybe they're hitting us first so we don't raise issues about Park Geon Ho's case.

00:51:43.485 --> 00:51:45.485
You're crazy.

00:51:47.136 --> 00:51:51.090
You guys think you're doing something huge, huh?

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.211
We're like a spec of dirt under a toenail to the people above.

00:51:54.235 --> 00:51:56.955
Why would they care so much about us?

00:51:56.955 --> 00:52:01.032
They just did it without any special reason. And we just got unlucky.

00:52:01.032 --> 00:52:05.889
You should know where you stand before you make speculations.

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:10.296
There's no need to put ourselves down like that.

00:52:10.296 --> 00:52:14.971
We just need to drink and forget about it.

00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:16.827
That's our style, isn't it?

00:52:16.827 --> 00:52:18.644
Let's go! I'll buy.

00:52:18.644 --> 00:52:21.444
I'm good. I'm going to go home.

00:52:21.444 --> 00:52:23.062
Okay.

00:52:23.062 --> 00:52:27.694
Then should we just go by ourselves or...

00:52:29.037 --> 00:52:32.404
He could've just stayed quiet and not touched it.

00:52:32.404 --> 00:52:36.017
It's not like he can take care of it.

00:52:36.017 --> 00:52:39.652
Why is he letting other people become collateral damage?

00:52:40.923 --> 00:52:42.123
Damn it.

00:52:47.796 --> 00:52:49.665
You'd better watch yourself today.

00:52:49.665 --> 00:52:52.998
I'll kill you if you cause a scene again.

00:52:52.998 --> 00:52:56.601
Team Leader. I know I don't have much experience,

00:52:56.601 --> 00:53:01.213
but anyone would've caught on.

00:53:01.213 --> 00:53:05.271
The reason they closed Park Geon Ho's case with that nonsense

00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:08.676
was to stop us from reinvestigating Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:53:08.676 --> 00:53:13.322
Jae Hong already said it. There's no need to overthink it.

I can't accept the fact that we're like a speck of dirt under a toenail.

00:53:25.384 --> 00:53:33.373
They're treating us like that because we're letting them!

Even though we may not be able to change the world,

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.592
I believe that we can change someone's life.

00:53:43.122 --> 00:53:46.030
I think they're interested in me.

But she's too young!

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.449
Go ahead and talk to them if you want.

00:53:56.449 --> 00:53:59.465
It's too soon. They need to drink a bit more.

Man Goo and Ji Woong know it too.

00:56:30.773 --> 00:56:32.973
He wanted us to...

00:56:34.479 --> 00:56:37.323
start over from here.

00:57:00.324 --> 00:57:07.063
Did anything suspicious happen around the time that Yoon Ji Seon was killed?

00:57:07.063 --> 00:57:09.857
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

00:57:09.857 --> 00:57:13.116
We need to conduct an additional investigation.

00:57:13.116 --> 00:57:16.727
I'm sorry to ask, but can you think about it carefully?

00:57:16.727 --> 00:57:17.966
I'm not sure.

00:57:17.966 --> 00:57:19.833
Did she have a boyfriend

00:57:19.833 --> 00:57:23.280
or a man who was chasing after her?

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.504
She did have a boyfriend.

00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:29.988
I think I did hear them fight over the phone back then.

00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:31.420
But other than that...

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.229
Do you know who her boyfriend was?

00:57:38.002 --> 00:57:41.402
Didn't you already look into all of this before?

00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:44.477
Why are you asking the same questions again?

00:57:44.477 --> 00:57:46.297
I didn't ask these back then.

00:57:46.297 --> 00:57:49.888
But those are the most basic questions to ask about the victim!

00:57:49.888 --> 00:57:51.642
Why not?

00:57:52.641 --> 00:57:56.208
Did you get Lee Dae Cheol's confession?
[November 15, 2015]

00:57:56.208 --> 00:57:58.240
I don't think he's going to confess easily.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.968
Why not? We have all the evidence.

00:57:59.968 --> 00:58:05.757
I just think there wasn't much done to look into Yoon Ji Seon.

00:58:05.757 --> 00:58:08.932
I should meet with the victim's family and friends and—

00:58:08.956 --> 00:58:13.239
The press is paying a lot of attention to this case.

00:58:13.239 --> 00:58:16.229
They're praising us for catching the killer quickly.

00:58:16.229 --> 00:58:18.084
If you drag this out for no good reason,

00:58:18.084 --> 00:58:21.405
they'll make a big deal about every little step of the investigation.

00:58:21.405 --> 00:58:25.705
Why would you do that when we have the killer?

00:58:26.425 --> 00:58:29.287
You were friends with Jang Jin Soo, right?

00:58:29.287 --> 00:58:29.935
Yes.

00:58:29.935 --> 00:58:31.917
He killed our fellow police officer.

00:58:31.917 --> 00:58:35.948
If you give him too much time and he ends up getting off,

00:58:35.948 --> 00:58:40.664
how would we be able to live the rest of our lives as cops?

00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:47.826
You bastard!

00:58:47.826 --> 00:58:51.108
I want to crash your skull right now.

00:58:51.108 --> 00:58:55.165
I didn't kill anyone! I didn't kill them! I had no reason to do that!

00:58:55.165 --> 00:59:00.174
The murder weapon that killed Jang Jin Soo had your prints and your DNA!

00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:03.600
Why would you kill Jang Jin Soo if you didn't kill Yoon Ji Seon?

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.902
You killed Detective Jang to cover up your crime!

00:59:07.902 --> 00:59:10.161
You bastard!

00:59:18.147 --> 00:59:21.789
No one looked at Yoon Ji Seon's boyfriend.

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:27.869
Yoon Ji Seon had a college friend who shared an art studio with her.

00:59:27.869 --> 00:59:30.869
I bet she'll be able to tell us something.

00:59:30.869 --> 00:59:33.283
Have you met with her?

00:59:34.631 --> 00:59:38.257
Yeah, I did meet with her

00:59:38.257 --> 00:59:42.831
but at the time I was convinced that Lee Dae Cheol was the killer.

00:59:42.831 --> 00:59:46.461
It was just a formality.

00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:50.324
What a nice way to start an investigation.

00:59:51.572 --> 00:59:53.181
Are you being sarcastic?

00:59:53.205 --> 00:59:55.705
The case is like a blank piece of paper.

00:59:55.705 --> 00:59:57.930
It's easier to write on a blank piece of paper.

00:59:57.954 --> 01:00:00.973
Whatever.

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:15.896
Why was this inside your desk, Detective Kwon?

01:00:15.896 --> 01:00:18.427
There are two possibilities.

01:00:18.427 --> 01:00:20.684
Either you stole it,

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:28.145
or you forgot to submit evidence from the scene to the evidence room.

01:00:29.383 --> 01:00:32.338
I'll have to look into it,

01:00:33.015 --> 01:00:36.215
but I think it was the latter.

01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:39.736
Our main target was Detective Kang.

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:44.004
But we're still lacking a lot of evidence to prove his corruption.

01:00:44.004 --> 01:00:49.408
I would like you to help us out with that.

01:00:49.408 --> 01:00:50.811
So you're telling me to—

01:00:50.835 --> 01:00:53.868
I'm not telling you to make things up.

01:00:53.868 --> 01:01:02.118
You just need to update me on what Detective Kang is doing from time to time.

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:10.620
I'll postpone my decision about this until I get what I need.

01:01:13.752 --> 01:01:19.152
I remember that you shared this studio with Yoon Ji Seon for three years.

01:01:19.152 --> 01:01:20.755
Is that right?

01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:21.434
Yes.

01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:27.829
So you must know pretty much everyone she met with during that time.

01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:29.495
Like her boyfriend.

01:01:29.495 --> 01:01:32.610
But Ji Seon was pretty introverted, so she didn't

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:35.010
really talk to others about her business.

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.972
I don't know who she met with besides the people from our major.

01:01:37.972 --> 01:01:41.329
What kind of paintings did she paint?

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:43.116
She painted a lot of people.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.727
Did she ever say that she painted her boyfriend?

01:01:45.727 --> 01:01:48.204
That seems very likely.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:52.167
No, she hired models for her work.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:55.068
She never painted our friends from the department, even though they asked her to.

01:01:55.068 --> 01:01:57.625
She had a lot of pride in her work.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:01.412
Do you remember any of her models?

01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:04.030
The most recent one around the time of her murder.

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:08.135
I don't know... It was such a long time ago.

01:02:08.135 --> 01:02:10.268
Please think about it carefully.

01:02:15.495 --> 01:02:17.786
Mr. Oh will be here once his meeting is over.

01:02:17.786 --> 01:02:19.289
What would you like to drink?

01:02:19.289 --> 01:02:21.403
We're okay.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:29.020
Hey, hey! You can't go there without permission!

01:02:32.558 --> 01:02:34.158
Hey.

01:02:35.203 --> 01:02:37.865
Oh Jong Tae has a lot of power.

01:02:37.865 --> 01:02:42.279
We might get even more pressure from above if we're not careful.

01:02:43.252 --> 01:02:48.185
You're sure there's a connection between him and the case, right?

01:02:48.185 --> 01:02:50.683
We'll find out after we talk to him.

01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:56.656
There was something she was working on right before she died.

01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:58.626
But I don't know who the model was.

01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:02.490
Ji Seon never showed me paintings she was getting paid to do.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:05.976
And some people who paid her requested that she doesn't show them to others too.

01:03:05.976 --> 01:03:08.913
Who usually paid her for their portraits?

01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:12.453
People with money who love themselves a lot.

01:03:12.453 --> 01:03:16.199
Do you have any of Yoon Ji Seon's old paintings?

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:20.480
I'm not sure. Her parents took most of them but...

01:03:21.244 --> 01:03:24.087
Hold on.

01:03:25.948 --> 01:03:32.025
I might not have her paintings, but I should have some of her sketches.

01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:39.960
She did sketches before she started painting.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.045
But they were just basic figures,

01:03:42.045 --> 01:03:46.689
so I don't think you'll be able to recognize faces from that.

01:04:15.825 --> 01:04:20.452
You think Yoon Ji Seon painted that?

01:04:20.452 --> 01:04:23.437
Is there a signature at the bottom?

01:04:23.437 --> 01:04:24.772
I'm sure she didn't sign it.

01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:28.096
She was embarrassed about accepting money for her paintings.

01:04:28.096 --> 01:04:29.350
Besides all that,

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:34.102
would an average person put up a painting done

01:04:34.102 --> 01:04:39.430
by a woman that he killed right in his office?

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:40.906
He doesn't care about stuff like that.

01:04:40.906 --> 01:04:43.173
What? Do you know him?

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.340
We're seeing each other often.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.805
What brings you here this time?

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:05.920

~ Preview ~
I got a tip that Oh Jong Tae was dating Yoon Ji Seon around the time she was murdered.

01:05:20.442 --> 01:05:21.779
She was so pretty.

01:05:21.779 --> 01:05:23.435
I'm afraid of something, too.

01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:24.780
Not catching the killer.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.848
There's a killer I need to find.

01:05:26.848 --> 01:05:28.249
Did you do it?

01:05:28.249 --> 01:05:30.980
Why did you bring in Jo Seong Dae?

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.907
I arrested him for the murder of Park Geon Ho.

01:05:32.907 --> 01:05:35.174
- You bastard.
- What?

01:05:35.174 --> 01:05:37.397
- There's someone who might be innocent.
- Eun Hye.

01:05:37.397 --> 01:05:38.654
Are you sure?

01:05:38.665 --> 01:05:40.670
I'm sure I can prove it and also bear the consequences.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.651
I lied to you.

01:05:42.651 --> 01:05:44.178
I did kill someone.

01:05:44.202 --> 01:05:45.929
We're not trying to catch a killer.

01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:47.838
We're trying to save someone's life!

01:05:47.838 --> 01:05:49.539
Ahjussi.

01:05:49.539 --> 01:05:51.924
Please help my dad.
