(Let's Go To Hell Together)

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.520
Did you really think I ever loved you?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.000
I never loved you.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.880
All the affection, intimacy,

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.600
and vows

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.759
we once had...

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.320
They were nothing but an act.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.399
I got close to you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200
and made you fall for me

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.079
to find out the truth
behind my sister's death.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600
So you wouldn't bear to harm me

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.519
and take the Mei pearl.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.519
But you turned out to be
the one who killed my sister!

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.799
So I couldn't bring myself

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.799
to keep up the act.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:15.719
I don't believe

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.680
what you're saying.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.599
Since it was all an act,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.000
of course I had to make it look real.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.280
Otherwise,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.680
a monster who's lived
for hundreds of years like you

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.159
wouldn't fall for my trap.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.680
Stay out of my life.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.680
Don't ever bother me again.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319
Otherwise, that silver bullet

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.519
will pierce right through your heart.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.879
Mr. Jing, I'll wait for you
in the dressing room.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.159
He gave me this.
It's actually quite lovely.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.159
- Lu.
- Lu.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.480
What's it with her?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680
I have no idea.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.080
Close the door.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.120
I saw you and Mr. Li part on bad terms.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.080
Did you fight?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.000
No, we didn't.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.680
We've completely gone our separate ways.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.560
Have you had a misunderstanding?

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.479
Mr. Li has truly adored you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.800
It shouldn't have come to this.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.879
There's no misunderstanding.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.199
He adored me

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.319
because he saw me as a mere replacement.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.360
The one he truly loves

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.159
is another woman.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.240
And I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.919
was just a substitute.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.560
Silly girl.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.080
As long he treats you sincerely,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.120
why dwell on being a substitute?

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.120
You need not care too much about that.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.120
What matters most

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.520
is asking your heart

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.520
if he's truly the one.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.120
But is he the one though?

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.120
He doesn't love me.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.759
He even killed my sister.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.120
It's a blood feud between us.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.520
How could I ever love him?

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.479
If so, let him go completely.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.680
Whether you move forward

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.879
or take a step back,

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.560
don't trap yourself in a rut.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.680
Being stubborn

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.319
will only hurt you more.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.319
There, there.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.280
What should I do?

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.120
There, there.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.399
Let her go.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.600
My good brother.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.879
She's about to be my wife.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.839
Jing Haisi.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:26.879
I've made up my mind.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.639
You win.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.000
I agree to remove the Mei pearl.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.199
A wise man knows when to yield.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.519
You're not entirely foolish.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.079
When will you do so?

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.399
The Mei pearl isn't with me now.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.199
And my Wujian force is fading by the day.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.240
I don't even know
if I'll last until then.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.800
You must give her back to me.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.000
Why should I?

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:51.240
On the night of the Crimson Moon,
I'll carve out her heart

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.839
and retrieve the Mei pearl.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720
But before that,

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.839
I'll torture her every day

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.480
and make her hate me to the core.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.279
Great.

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.279
I'd like to see
how you're going to torture her.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.839
Once her heart breaks completely,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.000
I'll cut her heart out.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.399
That sounds fun.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
That's more like it.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.399
Humans are nothing but tools to us.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.079
We can make this deal happen.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.240
However,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.000
I'll have someone watch you every day.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.639
Don't you dare play tricks
under my nose.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.000
Extra! Extra!

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.199
Lu Huayan has been expelled
from the Paramount by the chief inspector!

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.160
Extra! Extra!

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.560
Miss Lu, you still have the nerve
to show up here.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.439
Didn't you know?

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.800
The chief inspector

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.040
has already ordered your expulsion
from the Paramount.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.279
From this day forward,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.639
you're no longer part of the Paramount.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.959
A woman as vicious as you

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.759
has no place here.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.199
So you brought me back here

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.279
just to humiliate me

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.959
and get back at me?

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.240
You're quite perceptive.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.800
Your death is near.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.199
Kill me, then!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.240
Guess what I'm afraid of. Death or you?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.639
Want to die?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.879
It's not time yet.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.800
Since Lu Huayan is no longer
with the Paramount,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.720
Mr. Li,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.519
why don't you slap her twice

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.720
to cheer me up?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.820
You can't bring yourself to do it, huh?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.279
I'll do it myself.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.480
Has that cheered you up?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.279
Feeling satisfied?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.720
Happy now?

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.879
Wretched girl.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.000
Mr. Li.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:10.160
If Mr. Jing finds out
that you still feel guilty towards her,

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.720
I'm afraid he won't be pleased.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.720
Miss Lu.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.360
A vicious woman like you

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.079
isn't worthy of being
the Paramount's top performer.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.319
I think Gu Meng is far more suitable.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.920
After all, she's more popular than you.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.399
I'm honored and grateful

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.879
by your favor, Mr. Li.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.319
Both of you are nothing
but birds of a feather.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.360
You're just the same.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.720
Miss Lu.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:42.319
Didn't you hear what Mr. Li just said?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.759
From now on,

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.720
I, Gu Meng,

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.279
shall be the Paramount's top performer.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.360
And you

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.600
will forever walk
with your tail between your legs.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:02.680
Li Motong.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.000
You are both pathetic

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.079
and despicable.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.279
Mr. Li.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.900
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:19.079
Don't tell me
you're going after Lu Huayan?

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.160
None of your business.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.990
Of course
it's got everything to do with me.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.920
I've received Mr. Jing's order

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.879
to keep an eye on you.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.160
He wouldn't want you to break the promise

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.279
and get back together with Miss Lu.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.519
Naturally, I need to grasp
your whereabouts.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.120
You're nothing but Jing Haisi's lapdog.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.370
Who do you think you are
to be talking to me?

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.279
What did you say?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.399
What did you say?

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:46.879
Get lost!
