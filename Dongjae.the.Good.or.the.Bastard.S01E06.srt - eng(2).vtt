(All characters, organizations, )

00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.980
(and events in this drama
are fictitious)

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:21.819
Sir, can you take a look at this?

00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:25.490
What's this doing here?

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:30.746
Can you turn the light off?

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:34.875
Why is this here?

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:40.088
I was right.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:43.675
A partial fingerprint was found
in the gun trigger,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.884
and it belonged to him.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.762
He shot a gun before he died?

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:50.599
We have to sample every DNA.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:01.443
So, Kang Soo-min shot
the gun first,

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:03.195
and if that hurt the culprit,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.198
the culprit took the gun
with his wounded body

00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:07.616
and did this?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.301
Do you think that's possible?

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:10.494
We'll have to see

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.371
if any DNA got mixed.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:16.249
But what we need is
the culprit's fingerprints.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.920
It seems the culprit shot the gun
with gloves on.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.547
There's only a trace of
a smudged fingerprint.

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:35.018
If he got shot,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.065
there must be a trace of blood.

00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:57.040
Even if the bullet
only brushed past him,

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:59.167
he must've dripped
at least one drop of blood.

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:05.382
He wouldn't just wipe his blood
and leave

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:07.509
after killing a man.

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:12.389
(Gunsam Sauna)

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.230
No surveillance cameras.

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:23.692
No trace of blood.

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:28.196
No cars.

00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:37.831
Yes, I'll go now.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.293
Have you located
the victim's car yet?

00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:42.751
It's not outside.

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:44.729
We got the license plate number.
We're looking for it.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:46.298
But he's from Seoul.

00:02:46.423 --> 00:02:47.549
He probably drove here.

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:50.052
It's not in the area. Maybe
that junkie took a train here.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.309
CSI will check here.

00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.811
When's that going to be?

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:00.979
We're short of hands.

00:03:01.104 --> 00:03:03.398
We had to bust that drug deal too.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.193
It's the thirsty one
that digs the well.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:09.029
Thirsty, my ass. I have to
go back to the station.

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:10.488
Wait.

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:12.657
The victim Kang Soo-min's car.

00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:15.160
Check if that car passed
the toll gate to Cheongju.

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:17.345
If there's a record of entering,
but the car isn't here,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.637
it means someone moved the car,

00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:20.289
and it must be the culprit.

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.542
- Okay.
- Oh, and Park Chan-hyuk.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.170
Can you bring him here?
I need to check something.

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.671
Check what?

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:30.550
To check if the man inside is the
distributor and who the maker is.

00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:34.763
But he took off.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.682
You missed him?

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:39.434
He dashed even before I knew.

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:40.602
In a split second.

00:03:40.727 --> 00:03:42.395
And I also got a report
about this place.

00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.189
You told me not to worry
about missing him.

00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:47.192
But if the gun was found here,

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:48.835
it means Park Chan-hyuk didn't
kill Yu-ri.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.904
That's not the only case.
What about this case?

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.906
I thought you asked someone else
to watch him.

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:54.824
I did.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.328
We're currently checking if
cameras caught him taking off.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.411
Bye now.

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:02.874
Shoot.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.084
Whatever.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.629
You think I can't catch who did it
without someone else's snitch?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.431
Is this my hair?

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:20.684
He didn't even leave
a single strand of hair?

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:29.109
He wouldn't have worn gloves
for ramyeon, right?

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:44.416
Is it too much?

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:49.879
Shoot. He even cleaned
the stove knob.

00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.017
Unless he had no fingers...

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:08.689
How can there be
no fingerprints at all?

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.525
Maybe it's an old man.

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.862
Now the technology has improved,

00:05:13.987 --> 00:05:15.822
but if one made drugs
since the old days,

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:17.824
sometimes they have
no fingerprints.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:24.539
After staying here
just for a few hours,

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:27.542
no matter how many times I shower,
the smell won't come off.

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.461
Imagine how that'd affect
your fragile skin.

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:34.090
Wait.

00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:40.430
I'll be fine.

00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:43.975
If it's strong enough
to erase the fingerprints,

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.978
the one who made it
wouldn't be so healthy, right?

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:53.192
Perhaps he doesn't stop coughing?

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.029
If he made it for his whole life,
it won't stop with coughing.

00:05:56.154 --> 00:05:57.739
It'd completely ruin his lungs.

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:02.744
- He...
- What?

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:04.579
Never mind.

00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:13.296
One thing I know for sure is

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:15.507
that he has no fingerprints.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.555
Shoot. I should've taken
a closer look.

The phone is ringing,
but why won't he pick it up?

Who are you?

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:33.293
How can a junkie lose his drugs

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:34.711
like an idiot?

00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:36.629
Did you kill the girl too?

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:40.300
No. I really don't know
who took it.

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:42.010
You damn son of a gun.

00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:44.721
Listen.
That hostess bar isn't mine.

00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.347
Is it just me
who's bothered by that?

00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:52.520
What are you doing?

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:54.689
- Who is it?
- It's Dong-pal.

00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:01.488
Where the hell are you?

00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:02.922
Why didn't you freaking show up?

00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:05.408
Seriously, is this
how you want to play?

00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:08.786
- Cat got your tongue? Hey.
- Speak.

00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:13.208
Cat, my ass. I've been
with the police the whole time.

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:14.167
The police?

00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:15.852
They were questioning me
where I was last night.

00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:17.212
I was at work.

00:08:17.337 --> 00:08:18.980
You should've told them
you had to call the prosecutor.

00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:20.840
What were the police doing there?

00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:23.134
Whatever. Where's Choi Geum-ho?

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.470
Did you miss him?

00:08:26.304 --> 00:08:28.056
How can you miss him? Damn it!

00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.642
So where the hell is he hiding
right now?

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:32.393
I don't know!

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:35.396
How can you miss him? Shoot.

00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:37.148
Hey.

Hey, can't you teach
your snitch better?

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:41.294
Ma'am, Seo Dong-jae is
taking revenge on me

00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:42.862
for excluding him.

00:08:42.987 --> 00:08:44.030
Turn the wheels.

00:08:48.993 --> 00:08:50.662
What a piece of garbage.

00:08:51.287 --> 00:08:53.790
Hey, is Choi Geum-ho your brother?

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:55.016
How can you snitch
on your brother?

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:56.501
Not my brother. Brother-in-law.

00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:00.213
Did you tell him you saw
who sold the drugs?

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:05.552
Yes.

00:09:06.094 --> 00:09:07.178
Yes. I did. Yes.

00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:08.471
Who else?

00:09:09.013 --> 00:09:10.723
Only my brother-in-law.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:13.810
But I'm not sure

00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:16.062
who he might have said it to.

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:19.983
I'll ask him in person...

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:22.569
No, don't bother.

00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:23.836
You know how to make a call.

00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:26.739
For something this important,
I should be asking in person...

00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:29.617
It's my fingerprint.

(Park Chan-hyuk)

00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:05.028
The person you've reached is
not available...

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:09.032
Your brother must've found out
that you betrayed him.

00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:12.243
I won't have to bury you myself.

00:10:12.368 --> 00:10:15.830
If I leave you on a road, you'll
be stabbed in a matter of time.

00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:20.083
I know where Choi Geum-ho is.

00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.044
So?

00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:24.505
He can't be more messed up.

00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:28.051
He won't last long in prison.

00:10:29.342 --> 00:10:31.303
- So you should...
- I should

00:10:32.055 --> 00:10:33.097
kill him?

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:36.225
Are you saying that's the best
for your brother-in-law?

00:10:37.644 --> 00:10:39.979
I've dealt with tons
of human trash before.

00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:41.397
Wow.

00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:44.817

I was a damn prosecutor's snitch.

00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:52.742
So what?

00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:56.788
Turn me in. What does that mean?

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:00.166
That means
I can tell them on your behalf.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.211
That it was all that girl's doing.

00:11:03.586 --> 00:11:06.464
The one who stole the drugs
and sold them.

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:09.550

Anyone?

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:42.875
Prosecutor Seo, I just...

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.044
Get Kang Soo-min's address
in Seoul

00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:47.463
- and request a search warrant.
- What?

00:11:47.588 --> 00:11:49.215
He's the victim
in Soogok-dong sauna.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.342
Oh, and you know
Spare Bowling Center?

00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:53.010
See whose name

00:11:53.136 --> 00:11:54.220
it's registered in.

00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:56.072
Name, address, any information
you can find.

about where you were.

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:00.976
Me?

00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:02.812
Where's she now?

00:12:02.937 --> 00:12:05.732
She was heading to the police
station with Prosecutor Jo.

00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:07.232
Prosecutor Jo too?

00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:09.485
Hey.

00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:11.821
Meet me there.

00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:14.531
This is great.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.659
(Soogok-dong Murder
Investigation Team)

00:12:17.784 --> 00:12:19.787
It was closed during COVID-19,

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:20.955
and about 2 years ago,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.499
the victim Kang Soo-min rented it.

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.336
The prosecution thinks
he's the distributor...

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:30.757
What the hell?

00:12:31.924 --> 00:12:33.217
Kim Hyung-woo, raise your hand.

00:12:34.177 --> 00:12:35.887
Who's Kim Hyung-woo?

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:37.054
What?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.015
Bring Park Chan-hyuk.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.018
What are you staring at? Why do
you think we missed Choi Geum-ho?

00:12:42.977 --> 00:12:45.104
Did you miss him? Oh, no.

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:46.564
Hello, ma'am.

00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:48.691
Come in.

00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:52.653
Why are you venting on them?

00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:55.823
Didn't you see
what it says outside?

00:12:55.948 --> 00:12:58.242
This is the Soogok-dong murder
investigation team.

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:01.120
Screw Soogok-dong.
That's none of my business.

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:03.206
I didn't ask for this.

00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:04.749
Bring me Park Chan-hyuk.

00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:06.225
Why are you looking for him here?

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.085
Did you investigate him here?

00:13:08.211 --> 00:13:10.546
No, we went to the hostess bar.

00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:12.215
And?
We split after the investigation.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:12.673
We split after the investigation.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.634
He had to go to
the cement factory.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:16.344
You don't know where he is?

00:13:16.469 --> 00:13:18.095
No, it's not that they don't know,

00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:20.723
but it sounds like
they just let him go.

00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:22.241
He wouldn't dare to show up
for the deal

00:13:22.266 --> 00:13:23.810
when the police were ransacking.

00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:26.437
Only if he showed up,
we would've caught Choi already.

00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:29.565
You're the blame
for your own snitch.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.817
Come here.

00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:35.905
Take a look at that.
Do you know who that is?

00:13:40.284 --> 00:13:41.327
(Kang Soo-min)

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.537
No.

00:13:42.662 --> 00:13:44.038
You don't know Mr. Kang?

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.793
Did you kill him?

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.753
- What?
- Kill him?

00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:53.005
Did Choi Geum-ho order you
to kill Mr. Kang?

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.549
So you killed him
with these hands?

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.843
No, I didn't even know
he was dead.

00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:04.934
That's all I needed. Take him.

00:14:05.643 --> 00:14:06.769
Shoot.

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:09.897
If Mr. Kang's dead,
you should've told me.

00:14:10.022 --> 00:14:11.899
- Why would I?
- Because it's my case.

00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:14.861
Since when Im Yu-ri's death
was your case?

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:16.612
What does this have to do
with Im Yu-ri?

00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:17.780
Mr. Kang is dead.

00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:18.948
Ma'am.

00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:20.783
The weapon that killed Im Yu-ri

00:14:20.908 --> 00:14:22.827
was found next to Mr. Kang's body.

00:14:25.788 --> 00:14:27.623
- The shotgun?
- Yes.

00:14:27.748 --> 00:14:30.376
The murder scene is presumably
used as the Purple Factory.

00:14:30.501 --> 00:14:33.004
Factory, my ass.
What's your evidence?

00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:36.507
Methylamine, acetone,
dichloromethane,

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:37.675
excipient.

00:14:37.717 --> 00:14:39.802
Ecstasy ingredients found
on the scene.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.722
(Pictures from the scene)

00:14:42.847 --> 00:14:44.223
It's in purple color, no?

00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:47.727
Who made it? The maker.

00:14:47.852 --> 00:14:49.437
Why are you asking him?

00:14:49.562 --> 00:14:51.230
I'm still searching.

00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:52.915
Speaking of which,
I can't waste any minute.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.609
I'll get going first. Bye.

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:00.156
But...

00:15:03.492 --> 00:15:05.870
Sorry about the ruckus.
My apologies.

00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:13.169
What?

00:15:13.294 --> 00:15:15.796
You knew the police went to
see Park Chan-hyuk, didn't you?

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.593
Ma'am.

00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:22.845
I went to the terminal
in the afternoon.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.014
It's not like I knew
he was making a deal.

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:27.892
You think the police shouldn't
even have investigated Park?

00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:30.119
If they didn't take any action
after watching the video,

00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:31.979
that's a dereliction of duty.

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:34.190
Ma'am, if I hadn't
come here today,

00:15:34.315 --> 00:15:36.400
he would've hidden
Mr. Kang was dead.

00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:40.947
What we have left now is
Choi and the maker.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.532
Whoever catches them first
takes it.

00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:44.575
What?

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.285
I'm currently tracing the maker.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.913
It's highly likely that he took
off with Mr. Kang's car.

00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:52.249
I've requested a search warrant
on Mr. Kang's house.

00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:55.878
- Get him.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:15:59.674 --> 00:16:00.841
No.

00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:05.221
Is this what's called synergy?

00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:08.599
(Cheongju Police Station)

00:16:27.243 --> 00:16:28.995
The bowling center belongs
to Han Sang-sik.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.846
- I got the address.
- Enter it in the GPS.

00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:31.914
Yes.

00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:39.505
- I think he's a detective.
- What?

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:42.008
They're staking out already.

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:43.551
Don't stop. Keep going.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.680
Shush.

00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:52.018
Park Chan-hyuk.

00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:53.519
Who are you?

00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:55.187
Park Chan-hyuk!

00:16:56.856 --> 00:16:58.274
- Where is this prick?
- I'm sorry.

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.442
Park Chan-hyuk!

00:17:01.027 --> 00:17:02.445
Stop it, please.

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:04.488
Park Chan-hyuk.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.450
- Shoot.
- Sorry.

00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:09.368
Will you please stop?

00:17:09.493 --> 00:17:11.120
Where does Park Chan-hyuk live?

00:17:11.245 --> 00:17:13.330
Tell me. Where the hell is he?

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:24.592
Hurry up.

00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:30.139
Hurry.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.518
Hurry.

00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:38.522
Sir, we got him.

00:17:38.647 --> 00:17:41.567
But his wound is severe.
We should take him to...

00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:47.406
Sir, wait.

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:51.452
Choi Geum-ho?

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:55.331
Hey, Choi Geum-ho. Choi...

00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:04.548
Sir, he's dead.

00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:08.010
Shoot. That's bad luck.

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:09.678
What should I do?

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:11.222
Ditch him.

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:22.875
The police will think he died
on the way. It actually works.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.943
And

00:18:24.484 --> 00:18:25.986
change the boys.

00:18:26.654 --> 00:18:29.406
We still have a prick who dared
to make a deal with me.

00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:42.002
Please don't kill me. Please.

00:18:45.297 --> 00:18:46.381
Too bad.

00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:48.968
We'll say you killed her.

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:58.893
Think carefully in there.

00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:03.064
I'll go...

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.316
No, it's okay. Stay here.

00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:05.109
But...

00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:06.569
You'll only alert the suspect.

00:19:06.694 --> 00:19:08.445
I'll call you if I need you.
Wait here.

00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:09.613
Okay.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.423
Who is it?

00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:30.885
I'm looking for Han Sang-sik.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.803
I'm from the bowling center.

00:19:32.928 --> 00:19:34.430
- The bowling center?
- Yes.

00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:38.684
What do you want?

00:19:42.521 --> 00:19:43.606
What the hell do you want?

00:19:43.647 --> 00:19:44.690
Actually

00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:50.404
I'm from the prosecution service.

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:51.572
Voice phishing?

00:19:52.114 --> 00:19:53.364
No.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.951
Then I would've called you. I'm...

00:20:02.374 --> 00:20:04.877
Are you Mr. Han Sang-sik?

00:20:05.002 --> 00:20:06.170
Yes.

00:20:06.295 --> 00:20:08.589
Never mind. Excuse me.

00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:10.216
Wait.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.258
Did you just say a bowling center?

00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:15.261
I actually got a letter
about a bowling center

00:20:15.387 --> 00:20:17.181
and tax issues.

00:20:17.306 --> 00:20:19.116
- Can you take a look at it?
- No, it's too late.

00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:20.434
I don't mind. Come in.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:22.853
Honey, we have a prosecutor here.

00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:24.813
Give me the notice we received
the other day.

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:40.621
Help me.

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:48.587
Come in.
Are you the fellow prosecutor?

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.713
- Yes.
- Come in.

00:20:53.008 --> 00:20:54.051
Prosecutor Seo.

00:20:54.134 --> 00:20:55.177
Hey.

00:20:55.302 --> 00:20:57.596
Say hi to Sang-sik.

00:20:57.888 --> 00:21:00.683
He's a prosecutor,
and he's an expert in this.

00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:01.850
I see.

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:04.979
- Nice to meet you.
- What?

00:21:05.104 --> 00:21:07.690
Sang-sik here was involved
in cramming.

00:21:07.815 --> 00:21:08.732
You're good at this.

00:21:08.857 --> 00:21:10.484
You can count on him.

00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:12.544
Sorry for causing you a ruckus
when we just met.

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.405
No, no. I understand.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.824
Thanks to you,
I got a lot of protein.

00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:18.242
Thank you for the food.

00:21:21.744 --> 00:21:23.289
- Prosecutor.
- Yes?

00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:25.958
So I received this...

00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:27.126
Okay.

00:21:32.298 --> 00:21:33.507
Scamming someone else's name

00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:36.010
proves that he's no ordinary man.

00:21:37.052 --> 00:21:39.805
It's been proved,
but because it was a fraud,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.682
I have no way to find him.

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:43.934
It's not like I can post him
as wanted for coughing.

00:21:52.775 --> 00:21:53.818
Hello?

00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:55.946
Yes.

00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:57.865
Now?

00:21:59.158 --> 00:22:01.785
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:06.248
I'm sorry.

00:22:08.042 --> 00:22:09.084
It's an autopsy.

00:22:24.056 --> 00:22:25.099
Park Chan-hyuk.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.185
Chan-hyuk.

00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:29.396
Come out when I'm being nice.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.689
Park Chan-hyuk! Damn it.

00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:33.108
Park Chan-hyuk.

00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:37.112
Park Chan-hyuk. Shoot.

00:22:38.072 --> 00:22:39.990
Chan-hyuk. Park Chan-hyuk.

00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:41.240
Park Chan-hyuk!

00:22:41.992 --> 00:22:44.495
Let me sleep.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.038
Sorry.

00:22:49.124 --> 00:22:50.417
Hey, it's me, Byung-gun.

00:22:50.542 --> 00:22:52.378
I won't get mad at you.
Come out.

00:22:54.004 --> 00:22:55.798
Why was there nothing
in the autopsy?

00:22:55.923 --> 00:22:57.341
He should've fought back at least.

00:23:04.098 --> 00:23:05.182
Gosh, so tired.

00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:15.775
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

00:23:17.444 --> 00:23:19.113
I doubt they'd approve it.

00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:24.368
(Place to search,
Spare Bowling Center)

00:23:28.497 --> 00:23:30.124
There's nothing to write.

00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:32.835
The call history.

00:23:42.553 --> 00:23:44.888
(Call History)

00:23:48.267 --> 00:23:49.952
Find the number of the part-timer
who worked

00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:52.479
in the bowling center with Yu-ri
in her call history.

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:05.449
So? Do you want me to lie down
in your office?

00:24:05.576 --> 00:24:06.785
No.

00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:09.788
Humiliation isn't enough.

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:13.876
What if I say you took it
from me by force?

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.502
What if...

00:24:17.087 --> 00:24:19.131
Seo Dong-jae, come out!

00:24:19.255 --> 00:24:22.217
The corrupted prosecutor
stole my land!

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:24.595
Seo Dong-jae!

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.139
Everything Seo Dong-jae says is
bullcrap!

00:24:29.682 --> 00:24:31.560
No, he wouldn't do that.

00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:32.978
Gosh, he'd totally do that.

00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:36.648
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

00:24:36.773 --> 00:24:39.318
By paying her!

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:41.320
He's more than capable
of doing that.

00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:45.365
Please. Release him.

00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:48.619
I swear I won't bother you again
with the land issue.

00:24:55.876 --> 00:24:57.044
Then...

00:25:06.512 --> 00:25:09.014
Sir, Gyeo-rye isn't
in the station.

00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:11.683
What do you mean he's not here?
He's supposed to be out today.

00:25:11.725 --> 00:25:14.268
Yes, so I'm here to pick him up.

00:25:14.394 --> 00:25:15.729
But

00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:16.897
he's not here.

00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:35.457
If I neglect him, I'm worried
he'll get in trouble again.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.923
You went out of your way
to deliver him.

00:25:44.049 --> 00:25:45.467
How nice of you.

00:26:02.734 --> 00:26:04.528
Are you reselling it to me?

00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:06.655
For you to rebuy it.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.257
The land you worked your ass off
to steal

00:26:08.282 --> 00:26:10.450
by breaking
a 100,000 dollar porcelain.

00:26:10.576 --> 00:26:12.369
This land is right in front of it.

00:26:12.494 --> 00:26:15.163
Before I change my mind
and hold out,

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:16.623
rebuy it when you can.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.593
The police were arguing your son's
imprisonment should be extended,

00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:30.470
and I barely shook them off. So?
Do you want me to take him back?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.101
You're desperate big time.

00:26:37.686 --> 00:26:39.688
You're talking so much.

00:26:41.148 --> 00:26:42.190
Okay.

00:26:42.816 --> 00:26:43.942
Here.

00:26:53.493 --> 00:26:54.536
Hurry.

00:26:54.786 --> 00:26:56.288
Where? Here?

00:26:56.413 --> 00:26:57.456
Yes.

00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:00.417
Okay.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.588
Here. Yes.

00:27:06.173 --> 00:27:07.215
Freedom.

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:10.927
Don't you need to seal
the contract?

00:27:11.053 --> 00:27:12.095
Oh.

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:19.436
We should seal it.

00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:23.523
The ink.

00:27:34.368 --> 00:27:35.410
Well...

00:27:37.746 --> 00:27:40.165
Make sure to transfer
the registration.

00:27:44.086 --> 00:27:45.253
The end.

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:52.344
Oh, the drug investigation
will continue.

00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:54.471
He's only free
from the murder charges.

00:27:54.596 --> 00:27:56.556
I'll take care of that.

00:28:00.602 --> 00:28:01.645
You wish.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.280
That arrogant son of a gun.

00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:13.990
Nam Gyeo-rye!

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:19.871
Take care, you wish.

00:28:19.996 --> 00:28:21.581
It's clear that he sold drugs.

00:28:22.874 --> 00:28:25.752
Please cancel the redevelopment.

00:28:34.177 --> 00:28:37.222
Now, if I catch the drug maker,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.891
I'm off to the supreme office.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.440
We must first clear
Gyeo-rye's drug charges.

00:28:46.565 --> 00:28:48.734
I'll give the general briefing,
so you don't...

00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:49.901
Oh.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.533
There.

00:29:01.663 --> 00:29:03.265
We don't have much time.
Let's deal with it immediately.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.959
We don't have much time.
Let's deal with it immediately.
Yes, sir.

00:29:06.835 --> 00:29:08.044
I'll begin now.

00:29:09.254 --> 00:29:11.339
Is he the one who said
he'd buy the rest?

00:29:11.465 --> 00:29:14.342
I don't know. I wasn't there.

00:29:15.802 --> 00:29:18.221
He said he wasn't at the scene.

00:29:19.097 --> 00:29:21.099
Yu-ri went to sell it alone.

00:29:21.224 --> 00:29:22.601
I swear I saw nothing.

00:29:23.018 --> 00:29:24.603
She sold it alone.

00:29:24.728 --> 00:29:27.272
That's all that matters, isn't it?

00:29:27.397 --> 00:29:30.317
You talked to the detectives
without me before, right?

00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:32.694
What did you tell them exactly?

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:36.364
There must be a reason
they mentioned the drugs, no?

00:29:37.991 --> 00:29:40.202
I told them about the terminal.

00:29:40.327 --> 00:29:42.387
I've checked the surveillance
cameras from the terminal.

00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:44.498
All right. Listen carefully.

00:29:45.624 --> 00:29:48.502
It's true that Gyeo-rye
brought the bag.

00:29:48.627 --> 00:29:51.546
It was caught in the camera.
We cannot deny it.

00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:52.714
I wanted to return it...

00:29:52.798 --> 00:29:55.342
No, Im Yu-ri asked you.

00:29:56.176 --> 00:30:00.013
She knew where the bag was
in which men's restroom slot.

00:30:00.138 --> 00:30:01.431
She couldn't go in there,

00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:04.059
so she asked you to bring it.

00:30:04.768 --> 00:30:07.604
You had no idea what it was.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.192
(Funeral)

00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:18.573
Im Yu-ri knew the drug supplier

00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:20.700
had left the bag in there.

00:30:20.826 --> 00:30:23.620
That's the reason she went to
the terminal in the first place.

00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:26.540
But I already told the police.

00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:32.254
The police investigation doesn't
count as evidence in trial.

00:30:32.379 --> 00:30:34.256
We'll say it was
a coercive investigation.

00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:36.399
And it was
a coercive investigation.

00:30:36.424 --> 00:30:38.468
Because someone's dead.
And who's that?

00:30:38.593 --> 00:30:39.845
An officer's daughter.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.556
They cornered you ruthlessly.

00:30:43.223 --> 00:30:44.908
The public is taking
a negative stance toward it.

00:30:44.933 --> 00:30:47.519
It's a matter
of how to change that.

00:30:47.644 --> 00:30:50.313
Nam Gyeo-rye's information
is all over the internet.

00:30:50.438 --> 00:30:52.065
There are also pictures
of his face too.

00:30:53.483 --> 00:30:55.151
His face is revealed.

00:30:57.737 --> 00:30:59.739
His face is revealed.

00:31:04.327 --> 00:31:05.579
His face is revealed.

00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:08.582
His face is

00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:11.459
revealed.

00:31:15.213 --> 00:31:16.673
Then we should take
advantage of it.

00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:20.552
Nam Gyeo-rye.

00:31:22.429 --> 00:31:23.930
Keep it together

00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.974
and listen to
what I'm about to say.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.686
Hello.

00:31:29.811 --> 00:31:32.647
Do you work
at Spare Bowling Center?

00:31:33.023 --> 00:31:34.399
Sorry about that.

00:31:36.318 --> 00:31:38.069
- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:31:38.194 --> 00:31:40.989
Prosecutor Seo, I'm working
on what you asked to find.

00:31:41.114 --> 00:31:42.324
Keep up the good work.

00:31:43.283 --> 00:31:44.384
Did you get home safe last night?

00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:45.911
- Hello. Do you
- Yes.

00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:48.079
Work at Spare Bowling Center?

00:31:48.204 --> 00:31:49.247
Sorry about that.

00:31:50.123 --> 00:31:52.876
Maybe kids these days preferred
texting over calling?

00:31:53.418 --> 00:31:55.670
I wish I could just intrude

00:31:55.795 --> 00:31:57.130
illegally.

00:31:57.255 --> 00:32:00.342
Hello. Do you work
at Spare Bowling Center?

00:32:01.676 --> 00:32:02.719
You do?

00:32:03.762 --> 00:32:05.530
I'm calling from
Cheongju Prosecution Service.

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:06.723
Hello? Hello?

00:32:07.223 --> 00:32:08.266
She hung up.

00:32:12.437 --> 00:32:13.313
Hello?

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:15.523
Did you work with Im Yu-ri?

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:18.276
This isn't voice phishing.
It's the prosecution service.

00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:20.445
Do you know where your boss is?

00:32:21.321 --> 00:32:22.364
Prosecutor Seo.

00:32:22.697 --> 00:32:24.491
Can you come to
the bowling center now?

00:32:24.616 --> 00:32:26.660
Now. Yes. Thank you.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.679
Prosecutor Seo, the search warrant
on the victim's home in Seoul

00:32:29.704 --> 00:32:31.289
you requested last night.

00:32:31.414 --> 00:32:33.541
- Has it been approved?
- Yes, but

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:36.086
Prosecutor Jo took it.

00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:37.253
Why did he?

00:32:37.379 --> 00:32:39.673
He already headed to Seoul
with it.

00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:41.091
People in that room told me.

00:32:44.094 --> 00:32:45.804
Hey, you go.

00:32:45.929 --> 00:32:47.263
- Me?
- What are you doing?

00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:48.431
Oh.
Go.

00:32:48.515 --> 00:32:49.557
Go.

00:32:49.683 --> 00:32:50.725
The bowling center.

00:32:52.018 --> 00:32:53.395
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:32:55.897 --> 00:32:59.025
He even intercepts
other's warrants now?

00:33:09.035 --> 00:33:09.786
Sir.

00:33:09.911 --> 00:33:10.954
Can you talk?

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:13.515
I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush
to go somewhere.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.891
I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush
to go somewhere.
Really?

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:16.251
I'll call you back.

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:18.086
No, it's nothing urgent.

00:33:18.211 --> 00:33:21.131
I just wanted to check when you
were joining my company. Bye.

00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:22.340
Sir.

00:33:22.882 --> 00:33:23.967
Yes?

00:33:24.092 --> 00:33:26.970
I promise to give you
good news soon.

00:33:27.345 --> 00:33:28.613
Whether it's your work
or anywhere you go,

00:33:28.638 --> 00:33:31.558
I'll be the junior

00:33:31.683 --> 00:33:33.351
you're proud to introduce.

00:33:33.476 --> 00:33:34.561
I can be one.

00:33:34.686 --> 00:33:36.271
Please wait.

00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:38.732
Sure. Good luck.

00:33:38.857 --> 00:33:39.899
Be careful.

00:33:39.983 --> 00:33:41.026
Yes!

00:33:49.284 --> 00:33:50.869
Why do I have a bad feeling
about it?

00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:57.584
Did you get a hold of your boss?

00:33:57.709 --> 00:33:59.419
He doesn't pick up.

00:33:59.544 --> 00:34:00.587
Do you have the key?

00:34:02.422 --> 00:34:03.506
Sir?

00:34:08.344 --> 00:34:09.821
Do you know where your boss lives?

00:34:09.846 --> 00:34:11.389
Do you know where your boss lives?
No.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.198
What are you doing?
I have to clean that up.

00:34:28.323 --> 00:34:31.242
Check if the surveillance camera
caught your boss' face.

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:34.412
Okay.

00:34:36.331 --> 00:34:38.666
The person you've reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

00:34:55.725 --> 00:34:57.227
Yes, I know the bowling center.

00:34:57.894 --> 00:34:58.937
What?

00:35:00.105 --> 00:35:02.357
No need for CSI.
We have the device too.

00:35:02.482 --> 00:35:04.400
I'm outside the city
at the moment.

00:35:04.526 --> 00:35:05.944
I'll send someone else.

00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:08.238
- What for?
- One second.

00:35:34.347 --> 00:35:37.559
I am the father of the student
who was the suspect

00:35:37.684 --> 00:35:40.353
of the recent Cheongju
gun death incident.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.398
For being the first one
to find the dead friend,

00:35:43.523 --> 00:35:44.983
he was arrested on the spot.

00:35:45.108 --> 00:35:46.584
After being confined
with no evidence,

00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:49.737
my son finally returned
to my arms today.

00:35:49.863 --> 00:35:52.239
And he was cleared
from his murder suspicion.

00:35:53.616 --> 00:35:56.202
As you know, the victim was

00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:58.163
the family of a Cheongju officer.

00:35:58.288 --> 00:35:59.873
A detective captain's daughter.

00:36:00.498 --> 00:36:01.791
As a father myself,

00:36:01.916 --> 00:36:04.419
I understand his grief.

00:36:04.544 --> 00:36:05.920
However,

00:36:06.045 --> 00:36:08.756
the murder suspicion wasn't
enough, the police framed my son

00:36:08.882 --> 00:36:10.717
for selling drugs.

00:36:10.842 --> 00:36:12.135
- Why?
- Drugs?

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.678
Because the victim faced
a tragic death

00:36:14.804 --> 00:36:16.763
for selling drugs.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.728
A detective captain's daughter
sold drugs.

00:36:21.853 --> 00:36:24.105
That's what the police were
trying to hide.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.524
I didn't believe it at first.

00:36:26.648 --> 00:36:29.861
Until I heard it
from my son's own mouth.

00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:36.492
Your one and only mistake was

00:36:36.618 --> 00:36:39.579
falling for a girl
you shouldn't have.

00:36:44.042 --> 00:36:46.419
Nam Gyeo-rye, listen carefully.

00:36:46.544 --> 00:36:47.712
You had no idea.

00:36:47.837 --> 00:36:50.256
Im Yu-ri said she threw away
the drugs, and you took it.

00:36:50.381 --> 00:36:54.177
You never have imagined
she'd sold them.

00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:56.386
'I should've stopped her
more actively.'

00:36:56.512 --> 00:36:57.680
'I regret it.'

00:36:57.805 --> 00:36:59.974
'But Yu-ri told me
not to be tacky.'

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:03.185
'Yu-ri often asked me
to lend her money.'

00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:27.377
It was me who failed
to protect Yu-ri.

00:37:28.419 --> 00:37:30.380
I never expected her
to sell the drugs alone.

00:37:31.714 --> 00:37:32.757
Yu-ri

00:37:34.217 --> 00:37:35.885
knew my family had a gun

00:37:36.928 --> 00:37:38.595
all along.

00:37:40.098 --> 00:37:41.391
So she asked for the gun.

00:37:44.185 --> 00:37:45.770
If I hadn't given that to her,

00:37:47.605 --> 00:37:48.690
she...

00:37:49.399 --> 00:37:51.609
She said she'd trade them
for money,

00:37:52.944 --> 00:37:54.737
but I never expected her
to sell them.

00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:59.367
Do you know what the detective
in charge told him?

00:38:05.957 --> 00:38:07.290
'When you go to prison, '

00:38:08.376 --> 00:38:09.711
'stinky old men will adore you.'

00:38:09.836 --> 00:38:11.461
How can the police say that?

00:38:14.507 --> 00:38:17.051
You never let me down,
Nam Wan-seong.

00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:20.763
The coercive investigation
and human right violation

00:38:20.888 --> 00:38:23.141
during his confinement.
I will keep fighting

00:38:23.266 --> 00:38:25.101
to reveal that.

00:38:25.517 --> 00:38:27.145
Whether it's the police

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.896
or the prosecutors.

00:38:30.648 --> 00:38:32.066
In the name of father.

00:38:41.117 --> 00:38:42.785
He didn't only take
the memory card

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.537
but smashed it.

00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:46.956
Do you have a picture
with your boss?

00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:49.042
Who takes a picture
with their boss?

00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:51.544
Have you taken pictures before
at work?

00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:54.088
- Yes.
- Can you look for it?

00:38:54.212 --> 00:38:55.255
Okay.

00:38:55.715 --> 00:38:57.800
Hi.
I'm from Cheongju Police Station.

00:38:58.468 --> 00:39:00.219
- Did you bring it?
- Yes, here.

00:39:35.755 --> 00:39:36.798
(CAS: MDMA)

00:39:39.884 --> 00:39:40.927
MDMA.

00:39:43.513 --> 00:39:45.223
- Ecstasy.
- Yes.

00:39:56.317 --> 00:39:57.693
This is where it began.

00:40:05.368 --> 00:40:07.286
Starting with Im Yu-ri's death

00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:09.747
and the drug cartel.

00:40:16.086 --> 00:40:17.629
Prosecutor Seo.

00:40:36.357 --> 00:40:38.693
Wait till I make it in
the supreme office after this.

00:40:38.818 --> 00:40:40.653
You're no longer my senior.

00:40:43.072 --> 00:40:44.365
Investigator, what is it?

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.452
Prosecutor Jo, Mr. Kang's car
the prof took off with.

00:40:47.577 --> 00:40:48.719
Did you find it? Where is it?

00:40:48.744 --> 00:40:50.663
Pyeongtaek.
I'll send you the location.

00:40:50.788 --> 00:40:51.998
Okay.

00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:54.375
Pyeongtaek.

00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:56.627
Guiding to a new destination.

00:40:56.751 --> 00:40:57.794
(West Cheongju)

00:41:03.926 --> 00:41:05.136
Omitted from promotion.

00:41:06.846 --> 00:41:08.097
Excluded from contribution.

00:41:09.182 --> 00:41:11.726
You don't have to come
if you don't feel like it.

00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:13.728
Yes.

00:41:14.312 --> 00:41:16.647
I'd always been excluded.

00:41:17.523 --> 00:41:18.566
But...

00:41:20.902 --> 00:41:21.819
MDMA.

00:41:21.944 --> 00:41:22.987
Ecstasy.

00:41:24.322 --> 00:41:25.740
Now, I'm the only one
who knows it.

00:41:31.704 --> 00:41:33.204
It was all for this day.

00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:35.917
For me to greet a day like this.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.464
Let's go. Let's go.

00:41:41.756 --> 00:41:42.965
I'm going

00:41:45.927 --> 00:41:46.969
to the supreme office.
