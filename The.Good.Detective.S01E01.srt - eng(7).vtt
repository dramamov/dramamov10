The defendant Lee Dae Cheol killed a female college student and disposed of the body.

And he disposed of the body once again.

00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.990
It was a very brutal murder.

So the nature and the circumstances of the crime are very serious.

I can feel it, he is going to complicate things.

00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:58.802
So what?

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:02.747
If you really end up leaving because of a promotion, who else is going to be on desk duty?

00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:05.326
Should I ask the guy who always gets in trouble with the prosecution

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:07.823
for his spelling mistakes?

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:10.805

He thinks he's the team leader!

00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:19.710
He plans out his own schedule and makes the guys work.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.983
And when something goes wrong, I take the blame.

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:23.199
But if you ask the new guy,

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:25.338
do you think the team will listen? You saw them just now.

00:12:25.338 --> 00:12:27.085
And you can't put him with me!

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.599
He's a lieutenant! He's a higher rank than me.

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:31.648
- You think he'll listen to me?
- I don't know!

00:12:31.648 --> 00:12:33.092
Just take care of it.

00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:36.334
Like what the guys said, he's not someone who'll stay here for long.

00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:38.652
So just leave him in the office and tell him to write up reports.

00:12:38.652 --> 00:12:40.743
Why? Why, why?

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:41.896
What's the reason?

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.332
Did he stab you in the back in the past or something?

00:12:44.332 --> 00:12:48.160
It's because I think he will stab me in the back in the future!

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:53.004
The decision about my promotion will be announced soon.

00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:55.544
I don't want to step in shit right before it happens!

00:12:57.773 --> 00:12:59.140
Please.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.308
Ah, whatever!

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:32.974
This is Oh Ji Hyeok of Violent Crime Division Team 2.

00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:35.963
Okay, hold on.

00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:39.352
Yes, go ahead.

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.629
The missing person's name is Lee Eun Hye.

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:43.144
Age 18.

00:13:43.144 --> 00:13:45.210
What happened?

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:47.629
Go ahead.

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:50.512
What did you think about the team?

00:13:50.512 --> 00:13:52.037
I like that everyone is honest.

00:13:52.037 --> 00:13:53.837
Hold on.

00:13:55.186 --> 00:13:59.420
Here. You know what this is, right?

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.413
A round bald spot (alopecia).

00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:02.210
You know why people get these, right?

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.334
Yes.

00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:06.263
So you get what kind of mental state I'm in right now, right?

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:07.663
Sure.

00:14:07.663 --> 00:14:10.256
I'm sure an elite lieutenant knows this better than I do.

00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:15.385
But a missing person's case ends up as a runaway case after all that hard work,

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:19.162
and we get in so much trouble for wasting our time on it.

00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:22.940
If we consider it a runaway case and end up finding a body,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.611
then they say we messed up on our investigation and

00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:27.950
we killed the person when they could've survived.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.068
They go crazy! Totally crazy!

00:14:31.068 --> 00:14:36.088
If that happens during my current mental state,

00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:39.674
I'll just die.

00:14:39.674 --> 00:14:42.273
Die.

00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:45.293
You get it, right?

00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:48.345
You just need to go in there and tell them to hand the case over to another team

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:52.377
because it's your first day, and you're not in a position to take the case.

00:14:52.377 --> 00:14:55.698
- Okay?
- Sure.

00:15:03.693 --> 00:15:06.784
Hello, Lieutenant Yoon.

00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:09.654
You must be busy. To what do I owe this pleasure?

00:15:09.654 --> 00:15:11.012
We need to meet.

00:15:11.012 --> 00:15:12.441
With me? Why?

00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:15.222
Should I go to the department and make a scene?

00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:17.527
Or should we meet quietly?

00:15:17.527 --> 00:15:19.941
Where are you?

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:22.679
Okay. Okay!

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.137
Please take care of it for me.

00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:29.937
And keep in mind that we're a couple now.

00:15:31.676 --> 00:15:33.176
Fighting.

00:15:42.887 --> 00:15:47.852
He always does this. That bastard.

00:15:54.614 --> 00:15:57.184
Maybe I shouldn't have called the detectives?

00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:01.645
This could just be a runaway case. Maybe I was being too rash.

00:16:01.645 --> 00:16:03.124
What's the number of the person who filed the report?

00:16:03.124 --> 00:16:05.515
Give me one second.

00:16:22.887 --> 00:16:25.087
Wow.

00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:27.048
You shocked me.

00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:29.520
- You're here.
- Why did you get so pretty?

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.043
There should be a limit to how pretty you can get. You're almost unrecognizable.

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:38.738
Hey, I thought there was an actress sitting here when I first walked in.

00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:41.495
I thought they were filming something here.

00:16:41.495 --> 00:16:44.623
Is that how you usually speak to female officers?

00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:48.356
Not all of them. But we're kind of close.

00:16:49.621 --> 00:16:53.989
You had a meeting with your college friends at a wine bar earlier this year

00:16:53.989 --> 00:16:58.352
and the head official of the lawyers, Yoon Dong Pil, paid for the drinks.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:01.587
A total of 1,275,000 Won (~$1,275).

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.772
The rich guy is supposed to pay.

00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:11.205
And afterward, you were in charge of three cases Yoon Dong Pil's law firm took on.

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:12.724
Is that so?

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:18.787
And you stayed at Baekyoondo Hotel with your team during Lunar New Year, right?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:24.265
The hotel's reservation was under the name of the head of Incheon's union.

00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:25.575
I didn't receive anything.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.884
You can look at my bank accounts. They're all in the minuses.

00:17:27.884 --> 00:17:31.817
- So you're admitting to the crime.
- What crime?

00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:39.443
I asked the lawyer to take the case because the defendant said he couldn't afford one.

00:17:39.443 --> 00:17:41.700
So I introduced him to the lawyer at a bargain price.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.862
And our team went to the hotel for a stake out instead of enjoying the holiday.

00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:51.926
We just borrowed an empty room, so we don't use up all of our budget early in the year.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.418
That's not a crime.

00:17:53.418 --> 00:17:57.770
Have you bought drinks for your team members recently?

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.090
What?

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.773
Having someone else pay for you is also a form of a bribe.

00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:07.220
My goodness.

00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:22.351
Can I order a drink?

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.888
- Sure.
- A beer?

00:18:24.888 --> 00:18:26.858
You can pay for that.

00:18:28.504 --> 00:18:32.579
You said the name of your missing friend is Lee Eun Hye, right?

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:33.525
Yes.

00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:36.560
Do you have a picture of her?

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.060
Don't you have pictures of you two together?

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:50.456
The one in the yellow striped dress at the end is her.

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:54.246
Here.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.317
Hurry up and give it back!

00:18:57.341 --> 00:18:58.425
What about other pictures?

00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:01.913
I'll kill you if you scroll for other pictures! Give it back!

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.507
Where did she get the yellow dress from?

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:11.393
Where does she usually shop?

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:14.154
I told them everything when I filed the report.

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:17.130
I'm going to just go home if you keep hassling me.

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.491
Want to move to a different location?

00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:22.560
Somewhere we can talk comfortably.

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:33.434
Are you really a detective?

00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:37.487
It won't hurt you. There's no risk of getting caught either.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.722
Can you hold off for a bit?

00:19:42.722 --> 00:19:44.529
I'm not denying it.

00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:46.498
I'm just saying I need some time.

00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:49.296
You could do at least that much!

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.872
We used to be close.

00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:53.172
Of course.

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:55.098
There was some kind of chemistry.

00:19:55.098 --> 00:19:59.526
If I hold off on the investigation, won't it be obvious that we used to be close?

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:03.700
I think I'll get an order to do a more thorough investigation.

00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:07.264
After everything is finished,

00:20:07.264 --> 00:20:10.441
let's have a drink at the restaurant we used to visit often.

00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.437
See you later.

00:20:16.306 --> 00:20:20.738
Ugh, that brat.

00:20:20.738 --> 00:20:23.109
Since when did she...

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.754
I'm in front of the newspaper office.

00:20:25.754 --> 00:20:28.020
What are you waiting for? Come on in.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.482
- Can't we meet outside?
- Why?

00:20:30.482 --> 00:20:33.423
I just don't feel like going in.

00:20:33.423 --> 00:20:36.343
Come inside. I need to show you something.

00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:38.366
Fine.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:49.960
[Jeonghan Daily News]

00:21:12.123 --> 00:21:14.135
Reporter Park!

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:18.444
- Reporter Jang, did you check it!
- Yes, I confirmed it.

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:19.810
- What about you?
- I confirmed it.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.040
All right, all right.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.419
Hello? Hey, if you stab the prosecution in the back like

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:29.571
this, they won't give us any more stories!

00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:33.936
We're already getting the cold shoulder because of the arrest.

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:34.969
Come on.

00:21:34.969 --> 00:21:36.694
- Hey.
- Hi. You're here.

00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:39.202
Who do you think you are?

00:21:39.202 --> 00:21:41.748
I'm saying it because it's harming us too!

00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:44.161
- Let's go to the conference room.
- Okay.

00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:46.794
Don't get greedy.

00:21:46.794 --> 00:21:50.950
Just do what you're paid to do.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.127
Stay in your lane!

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:57.162
You know about Reporter Im Jong Pil, right?

00:21:57.162 --> 00:22:00.773
He recently moved to a TV station, so it's a bit of a mess here.

00:22:00.773 --> 00:22:02.362
I hope you understand.

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:05.190
Then you shouldn't have called me to the head office.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.535
And we shouldn't be entering this room alone.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:12.237
They're going to think I'm acting out because you have my back.

00:22:12.237 --> 00:22:14.494
I do have your back, though.

00:22:14.494 --> 00:22:17.850
Is that what you really think?

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.781
Take a look.

00:22:18.781 --> 00:22:20.545
I asked you, is that what you really think?

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:23.969
Reporter Jin, I'm talking business right now.

00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:26.652
Yes, sir.

00:22:29.107 --> 00:22:31.216
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.713
Put that away!

00:22:33.713 --> 00:22:36.410
Stop telling me what to do!

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.293
Fight me if you want to!

00:22:38.293 --> 00:22:41.048
What? Are you too scared to fight me because I killed

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:44.816
eleven people when Lee Dae Cheol only killed two?

00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:47.314
Bastards! You'll be the twelfth.

00:22:47.314 --> 00:22:48.878
You'll be the 13th,

00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:50.744
14th, 15th, 16th!

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.282
Remember your order!

00:22:52.282 --> 00:22:54.529
I'm going to slice your throats one by one.

00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:58.580
I'm going to drain all of your blood and chop you into pieces!

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.470
Asshole!

00:23:05.413 --> 00:23:06.536
Kill me!

00:23:06.536 --> 00:23:09.745
Kill me, you idiots!

00:23:14.517 --> 00:23:15.831
Do you know who that is?

00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:19.763
It's Jo Byeong Gil, who's serving time for killing eleven people seven years ago.

00:23:19.763 --> 00:23:24.687
The Minister signed off on his execution this morning.

00:23:24.687 --> 00:23:26.652
They just need the president's final confirmation.

00:23:26.652 --> 00:23:29.317
They're going to do an execution during the current presidential term?

00:23:29.317 --> 00:23:32.215
Reports about the execution are still off the record.

00:23:32.215 --> 00:23:35.739
Let's be the first ones to do it.

00:23:35.739 --> 00:23:39.056
Go interview the families of the victims.

00:23:40.512 --> 00:23:42.363
Why me?

00:23:42.363 --> 00:23:45.010
This isn't something that will be on the provincial news.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.234
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.

00:23:48.234 --> 00:23:53.232
You're thinking that protecting me, who's already hated, one more time won't make a difference, huh?

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.229
If that's the case, then I'll do it.

00:23:55.229 --> 00:23:58.931
Finish the interviews today and submit it before the deadline tomorrow.

00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:01.880
I'm asking you to do it because of your skills.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.300
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:24:32.902 --> 00:24:35.269
Her father's name is Lee Dae Cheol?

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:37.409
Okay.

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.148
Got it.

00:24:39.148 --> 00:24:40.815
Thank you.

00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:42.405
Bye.

00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:51.882
Oppa, I'm sleepy. Let's start after I take a little nap.

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:55.196
I paid for today and tomorrow.

00:24:55.196 --> 00:24:58.579
You can do whatever you want in here for two days.

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:02.769
Wow! You really have a lot of money, huh?

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:06.166
Did Eun Hye... ever talk about her father?

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:09.900
We don't talk about geezers.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.292
She's just an acquaintance, right?

00:25:12.292 --> 00:25:15.010
You're not close enough to her to report her missing.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.100
And you've never gone shopping together.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.111
And you didn't even know whether Eun Hye was wearing a dress or a t-shirt.

00:25:22.111 --> 00:25:23.280
I'm going to go.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.126
I hate talking about complicated things.

00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:27.050
One month.

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:31.507
You can stay here like it's your home for one month.

00:25:31.507 --> 00:25:32.717
Breakfast is included.

00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:35.600
You can substitute breakfast for room service too.

00:25:36.352 --> 00:25:38.519
What is it that you want?

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.137
Where's Eun Hye?

00:25:40.137 --> 00:25:42.206
I wouldn't have reported her missing if I knew that.

00:25:42.206 --> 00:25:43.680
Find it out.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.380
Two days.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.619
Extending the stay after that will depend on how you do.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.197
The Chinese restaurant on the 12th floor is good.

00:25:54.197 --> 00:25:56.286
No delivery though.

00:26:04.202 --> 00:26:06.031
At this rate, I will be bald soon.

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:09.999
It's because you're lacking male hormones.

- Who are you?

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.890
I'm Lieutenant Oh Ji Hyeok, who just joined Violent Crime Division Team 2 today.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:15.625
Ah, I see.

00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:18.506
I'm Nam Gook Hyeon, head of Violent Crime Division Team 1.

00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:20.461
Oh, hello.

00:38:22.157 --> 00:38:24.123
This watch.

00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:31.952
A detective shouldn't wear a fake.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.528
Is this a fake?

00:38:38.528 --> 00:38:41.602
I just bought it because I liked it.

00:38:41.602 --> 00:38:45.146
That brand is well beyond what you should be able to wear (financially).

00:38:45.727 --> 00:38:49.593
You should get rid of it before people get the wrong idea.

00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:08.592
This is one of the 80 watches that Swiss watch craftsman, Edgar Jone, designed.

00:39:08.592 --> 00:39:11.039
This is a rare item, and there are only two in Korea.

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:14.196
It's the most luxurious of the luxury items.

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:33.056
Ah, I think we're going to get busy.

00:39:33.056 --> 00:39:36.992
It's an assault case. The victim was badly injured.

00:39:36.992 --> 00:39:40.054
Seven of his ribs are broken, and one of his arms is fractured.

00:39:40.054 --> 00:39:43.209
He has a wound on his head, and his internal injuries haven't been confirmed yet.

00:39:43.209 --> 00:39:47.396
The doctor says he might become disabled.

00:39:47.396 --> 00:39:48.602
That's serious.

00:39:48.602 --> 00:39:53.171
The problem is, there is no CCTV footage, and the victim has a mental illness.

00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:55.003
So it's going to be a little complicated.

00:39:55.003 --> 00:39:58.209
We should meet with the victim and visit the site of the assault.

00:39:58.209 --> 00:40:00.460
We don't have any evidence, so I think we'll have

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.884
to do a stakeout near the site for about a week.

00:40:04.737 --> 00:40:07.043
We need to get a move on.

00:40:07.043 --> 00:40:10.254
Let's start the stakeout tonight. Come on, let's go.

00:40:10.254 --> 00:40:13.197
- What's the victim's name?
- The victim's name? What was it?

00:40:13.197 --> 00:40:14.799
- It's Park Do Cheol.
- Park Do Cheol.

00:40:14.799 --> 00:40:15.848
Age?

00:40:15.848 --> 00:40:18.456
He was born in 97, so...

00:40:18.456 --> 00:40:20.037
- Twenty-three.
- Yes, 23.

00:40:20.037 --> 00:40:22.956
We'll have to visit the hospital too, so we'll ask them there.

00:40:22.956 --> 00:40:24.434
Hold on, let me call and confirm.

00:40:24.434 --> 00:40:26.154
A call? Why? Call who?

00:40:26.154 --> 00:40:29.323
Do you know who to call?

00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:32.601
Thank you.

00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:34.250
Take care.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.232
Park Do Cheol, born in 97.

00:40:36.232 --> 00:40:38.773
His address is Bangsukdong in South Dongu, Incheon.

00:40:38.773 --> 00:40:39.822
Is that right?

00:40:39.822 --> 00:40:40.723
Yes.

00:40:40.723 --> 00:40:44.015
He signed up for accident insurance last month at five different places.

00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:46.415
The total amounts to 15 Mio. Won (~$150,000).

00:40:46.415 --> 00:40:49.103
It's insurance fraud!

00:40:49.103 --> 00:40:51.584
Aigoo. How did you get that information?

00:40:51.584 --> 00:40:55.057
Isn't it the basics of conducting an investigation?

00:40:57.198 --> 00:40:59.816
There have been many similar crimes in Seoul already.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.407
I just looked into it because it sounded similar.

00:41:03.407 --> 00:41:07.154
He says it's the basics of conducting an investigation, you turds.

00:41:07.154 --> 00:41:10.121
You should study instead of playing pool during your breaks!

00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:12.745
You should look into other cases too!

00:41:12.745 --> 00:41:14.198
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:41:14.198 --> 00:41:17.855
But shouldn't we meet with the victim and confirm?

00:41:17.855 --> 00:41:19.888
It could be a coincidence.

00:41:19.888 --> 00:41:22.918
It's better to hand it over to the insurance companies to investigate.

00:41:22.918 --> 00:41:25.853
They have a lot of experts with more experience than us.

00:41:25.853 --> 00:41:30.268
They'll request an investigation if they find a problem.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.079
You got lucky with your partner!

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:37.047
You'll get better too thanks to him...

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.605
Why are you sitting there? Do some research!

00:41:41.605 --> 00:41:45.018
Those people are acting out because of stupid detectives like you!

00:41:45.018 --> 00:41:47.668
You didn't know it either.

00:41:47.668 --> 00:41:49.095
I'm sorry.

00:41:49.095 --> 00:41:50.964
It's because we are stupid.

00:41:50.964 --> 00:41:53.031
Because we are stupid.

00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:03.130
Your late husband is Detective Jang Jin Soo

00:42:03.154 --> 00:42:06.819
who was killed by Lee Dae Cheol five years ago, right?

00:42:08.027 --> 00:42:09.527
Yes.

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.005
It must still be hard for you.

00:42:12.628 --> 00:42:15.464
I'm sorry for poking at your wound, but...

00:42:15.464 --> 00:42:21.051
Then why... why are you trying to write an article like that?

00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:21.780
Excuse me?

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:27.180
You know that it's still hard for me and that you're poking at my wound.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.177
Why are you making me go through the pain again?

00:42:31.902 --> 00:42:35.573
I don't understand why you're doing this.

00:42:35.573 --> 00:42:38.170
I don't intend to force you to do this interview.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.720
You can stop if it's too hard for you.

00:42:44.972 --> 00:42:47.896
Well, I've got to go.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.866
Eun Bi!

00:42:52.698 --> 00:42:55.394
I'm going to go. Close up the shop when you're done.

00:42:55.394 --> 00:42:58.156
- Okay.
- Good work today.

00:43:19.042 --> 00:43:21.042
Team Leader Nam Gook Hyeon?

00:43:21.042 --> 00:43:28.171
Our police department scored the lowest in friendliness in all of Incheon.

00:43:28.171 --> 00:43:30.480
Let's put extra effort when answering complaint calls.

00:43:30.504 --> 00:43:32.162
Especially you, Ji Man Goo.

00:43:32.162 --> 00:43:34.261
Why would you talk down to someone you've never met before?

00:43:34.261 --> 00:43:36.534
I didn't talk down to them!

00:43:36.534 --> 00:43:37.535
Oh, right. Sir.

00:43:37.535 --> 00:43:39.838
You have to use formal tone, even if they're younger than you.

00:43:39.838 --> 00:43:43.010
And be as polite as you can be when you talk to an ex-con, got it?

00:43:43.034 --> 00:43:44.434
Yes, sir.

00:43:44.434 --> 00:43:47.452
There's a regular inspection for internal public safety.

00:43:47.452 --> 00:43:50.778
Another inspection? They do it all the time.

00:43:50.778 --> 00:43:52.634
Hurry up and catch the convenience store thief.

00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:56.575
If one more store gets robbed, they'll say there's no public safety.

00:43:56.575 --> 00:43:57.576
And lastly—

00:43:57.576 --> 00:43:59.559
You said you would keep this short.

00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:02.046
We have an order from the chief.

00:44:02.046 --> 00:44:06.934
We must be the only ones who get an order from the chief.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.570
Fine.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.927
I'll end it there for today.

00:44:10.927 --> 00:44:14.909
Let's go out for dinner since it's Detective Oh's first day.

00:44:14.909 --> 00:44:18.960
A dinner for what? It's not like we got someone amazing.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.926
But we need to have some drinks. It's his first day.

00:44:21.926 --> 00:44:24.018
You guys can go without me.

00:44:24.018 --> 00:44:27.700
None of my body parts are working these days.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.864
I'm going to go and get some rest.

00:44:29.864 --> 00:44:32.354
Hyeongnim, can you take a look at this for me?

00:44:32.354 --> 00:44:35.770
Why are you asking me? Just do whatever the heck you want.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.004
Lee Eun Hye is on here.

00:44:58.784 --> 00:44:59.984
Why?

00:44:59.984 --> 00:45:02.152
What is it?

00:45:02.152 --> 00:45:03.991
We have a case.

00:45:04.863 --> 00:45:08.493
A dirty and twisted case.

00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:43.806
What is this?

00:45:43.806 --> 00:45:46.261
The girl who entered the field with him

00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:49.620
is Lee Eun Hye, who was reported missing this morning.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.605
Lee Eun Hye?

00:45:50.629 --> 00:45:52.308
She's Lee Dae Cheol's daughter.

00:45:52.308 --> 00:45:54.550
Lee Dae Cheol?

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.979
The guy you put away five years ago?

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.167
Detective Kang.

00:46:03.191 --> 00:46:04.848
This man has something to report.

00:46:04.848 --> 00:46:08.215
We're a little busy right now. Detective Choi!

00:46:08.215 --> 00:46:09.604
Are you sleeping?

00:46:09.604 --> 00:46:12.283
We have someone who wants to file a report. Team 1 needs to take it.

00:46:12.283 --> 00:46:15.005
- We have other urgent matters.
- Yes, sir.

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:17.345
Come this way.

00:46:24.393 --> 00:46:26.128
Please have a seat there.

00:46:26.152 --> 00:46:27.652
Thank you.

00:46:29.066 --> 00:46:31.107
What is this about?

00:46:31.107 --> 00:46:33.870
What the heck happened in the field?

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.570
I kidnapped a girl and killed her.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.051
- Are you saying you committed murder?
- Yes.

00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:41.487
You killed a girl?

00:46:41.511 --> 00:46:42.911
Yes.

00:46:42.911 --> 00:46:45.921
She was in her late teens,

00:46:45.921 --> 00:46:50.400
and I heard her name was Lee Eun Hye.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.260
Just a second.

00:46:53.792 --> 00:46:55.859
What's the victim's name?

00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:57.039
The victim's name.

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.918
What's your name?

00:46:59.918 --> 00:47:02.556
Where did you kill her?

00:47:02.556 --> 00:47:06.467
You kidnapped Lee Eun Hye and killed her?

00:47:06.467 --> 00:47:07.797
Yes.

00:47:07.797 --> 00:47:09.065
I think so.

00:47:09.065 --> 00:47:12.078
Say it clearly. Did you kill her or not?

00:47:12.078 --> 00:47:14.044
Did you really kill her?

00:47:33.058 --> 00:47:34.758
Is this you?

00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:36.889
Yes.

00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:38.152
Why did you kill her?

00:47:38.152 --> 00:47:39.593
I don't know.

00:47:39.593 --> 00:47:42.300
I don't remember anything. I was too out of it.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.067
Think about it carefully.

00:47:44.067 --> 00:47:47.730
What did you do to Lee Eun Hye in that field?

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:52.445
So I don't even know why I killed her,

00:47:52.445 --> 00:47:54.714
and I don't know if I really did kill her.

00:47:54.714 --> 00:47:56.714
And I don't know why I'm here.

00:47:56.714 --> 00:47:58.942
Shouldn't we test him for drugs?

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.635
- Damn it!
- You little.

00:48:00.635 --> 00:48:02.852
I don't do stuff like that.

00:48:02.852 --> 00:48:03.917
I'm fine.

00:48:03.917 --> 00:48:07.479
But you don't know what you did today?

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:12.659
I remember burying her.

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:14.684
Where?

00:48:14.684 --> 00:48:16.842
In this field?

00:48:16.842 --> 00:48:19.003
That idiot.

00:48:19.003 --> 00:48:22.887
I wouldn't have done anything if she just stayed still, but that idiot.

00:48:22.887 --> 00:48:25.530
This is all because of that crazy bitch.

00:48:26.105 --> 00:48:27.671
That bitch seduced me.

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:30.006
She was the one who suggested we go there.

00:48:30.006 --> 00:48:33.164
I didn't even know that she was a minor. Really!

00:48:33.164 --> 00:48:35.769
She looked like she was way over 20.

00:48:35.769 --> 00:48:38.402
That's not what's important right now.

00:48:38.402 --> 00:48:42.739
So you're sure that you killed her and buried her?

00:48:42.739 --> 00:48:44.239
Damn it!

00:48:44.239 --> 00:48:46.709
I told you already.

00:48:46.709 --> 00:48:49.195
I killed her and buried her!

00:48:49.195 --> 00:48:50.809
This is so annoying!

00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:52.409
You piece of—

00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:54.248
Where do you live?

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.950
You came here because you live nearby.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.717
I'm sure you didn't travel far to come here on purpose.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.300
Why?

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.355
Are you getting tired of me?

00:49:12.355 --> 00:49:14.555
Should I go somewhere else?

00:49:14.555 --> 00:49:16.536
Rape.

00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:18.520
Murder.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.148
Disposing of the body.

00:49:20.148 --> 00:49:23.817
You should bite on a case like this one.

00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:30.827
I was driving and saw someone throwing something down from the highway.

00:49:30.827 --> 00:49:32.852
At first, I thought it was a mannequin.

00:49:32.852 --> 00:49:36.108
But then I realized that it was a person.

00:49:36.108 --> 00:49:37.574
A person.

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.725
I'm sure it was a person.

00:49:39.725 --> 00:49:41.483
It's him.

00:49:41.483 --> 00:49:43.956
Can't you tell? It's him, right?

00:49:43.956 --> 00:49:45.149
It's him.

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.603
It sounds like it's a different person to me.

00:49:47.603 --> 00:49:51.661
He changed his tone purposely, so he sounds like a different person.

00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:53.009
Let's say that he did.

00:49:53.009 --> 00:49:54.864
What does it change if it is the same person?

00:49:54.864 --> 00:49:58.675
He's pranking us. He planned it all out.

00:49:58.675 --> 00:50:02.441
He's trying to make us think about the Lee Dae Cheol case.

00:50:02.441 --> 00:50:04.414
So why would he do that?

00:50:04.414 --> 00:50:07.728
How would I know? Damn it.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:15.682
Go to the crime scene that he reported, and we'll discuss it after.

00:50:15.682 --> 00:50:17.930
We won't be able to leave until the morning,

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:21.500
so you should go get some sleep.

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:27.628
This is Sim Dong Wook from Violent Crime Division Team 2.

00:50:27.628 --> 00:50:30.723
There's something wrong with Park Geon Ho! I think he's having a seizure!

00:50:30.723 --> 00:50:32.049
Okay.

00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:35.249
Park Geon Ho! Park Geon Ho!

00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:38.884
Park Geon Ho! Wake up!

00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:47.777
He looks fine to me.

00:50:47.777 --> 00:50:51.873
After I called you, it was getting worse, so I was going to move him to the infirmary.

00:50:51.873 --> 00:50:54.730
- But suddenly he was fine.
- Hey.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:58.273
- Do you have an illness?
- No.

00:50:58.273 --> 00:51:00.969
- I don't have any illness.
- Then what was it?

00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:02.416
Were you faking it?

00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:04.964
Why would I fake it?

00:51:04.964 --> 00:51:07.708
I just lost it for a second.

00:51:07.708 --> 00:51:10.366
That happens to everyone.

00:51:10.366 --> 00:51:13.877
Sometimes I get a seizure even though I don't have any illness.

00:51:13.877 --> 00:51:16.028
I heard it was because of stress.

00:51:16.028 --> 00:51:17.673
And that person was right.

00:51:17.673 --> 00:51:21.713
I heard this happens when being alive is harder than being dead.

00:51:21.713 --> 00:51:23.815
And it really did.

00:51:27.433 --> 00:51:32.517
It's so unfair that girl is suffering.

00:51:32.517 --> 00:51:34.780
It's so unfair.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.056
You're an evangelist?

00:51:51.056 --> 00:51:53.168
What has the world come to?

00:51:53.168 --> 00:51:56.266
You used to be a prison guard too.

00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:59.583
A former prison guard, and now an evangelist.

00:52:01.004 --> 00:52:03.970
Did you really kill someone?

00:52:05.354 --> 00:52:09.764
The prison he used to work at is the same prison where Lee Dae Cheol is.

00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:14.008
So you must know Lee Dae Cheol.

00:52:14.008 --> 00:52:14.980
Lee Dae Cheol?

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.455
You were at the same prison as him.

00:52:17.455 --> 00:52:21.155
He was on death row and you were a prison guard.

00:52:22.988 --> 00:52:24.827
Oh, inmate 1173?

00:52:24.827 --> 00:52:26.096
I know him.

00:52:26.096 --> 00:52:31.996
When a prison guard and an inmate get close, they become like brothers, right?

00:52:31.996 --> 00:52:34.228
Did he ask you to do this?

00:52:34.228 --> 00:52:36.992
Did you do this because he asked you to do it?

00:52:36.992 --> 00:52:40.923
Why would I become close with a murderer like him?

00:52:40.923 --> 00:52:42.983
He's not even human.

00:52:42.983 --> 00:52:45.887
Do you know how despicable he is?

00:52:45.887 --> 00:52:49.072
An animal like him cares deeply for his daughter.

00:52:49.072 --> 00:52:51.296
Isn't it contradictory?

00:52:51.296 --> 00:52:54.275
He killed someone who is like his daughter.

00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:57.032
So why is he worrying about his daughter?

00:52:57.721 --> 00:53:02.297
A bastard like him... needs to feel pain.

00:53:02.297 --> 00:53:08.174
The same pain that the parents of the girl he murdered felt.

00:53:35.658 --> 00:53:37.358
Where is it?

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.393
I think it was over there?

00:53:50.063 --> 00:53:53.478
Lee Eun Hye has a record.

00:53:53.478 --> 00:53:55.494
A record?

00:54:08.815 --> 00:54:12.215
Everything looks the same, so I'm getting confused.

00:54:12.982 --> 00:54:15.748
Think about it carefully!

00:54:24.534 --> 00:54:29.995
Released on a warning after two thefts, dine and dash, working at a hostess bar as a minor—

00:54:29.995 --> 00:54:33.400
That's enough.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.881
Which division was in charge of it?

00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:39.259
The dine and dash was the southeast division and the rest were Yeonsu Police Department.

00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:41.864
The detective in charge was Detective Park Seong Gyu.

00:54:41.864 --> 00:54:44.355
Park Seong Gyu.

00:54:44.355 --> 00:54:46.569
Park Seong Gyu.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.980
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.866
Why is his phone off at this hour?

00:54:57.866 --> 00:55:00.744
Where did they go?

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.330
Be careful over here.

00:55:05.266 --> 00:55:07.233
They're over there.

00:55:12.299 --> 00:55:13.269
Did you find it?

00:55:13.269 --> 00:55:16.570
He says he can't find where he buried her

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:20.250
because he was so out of it at the time.

00:55:23.049 --> 00:55:25.449
I really don't remember.

00:55:26.205 --> 00:55:29.158
You're smiling, you little...

00:55:32.135 --> 00:55:34.105
Are you messing with us?

00:55:34.105 --> 00:55:37.239
Do you think the police are a joke?

00:55:38.369 --> 00:55:40.959
Again! You're smiling again!

00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:43.411
- Stop smiling, you jerk!
- Keep calm.

00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:45.527
- Look at him! He's smiling!
- Calm down.

00:55:45.527 --> 00:55:46.800
You bastard!

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.002
We checked the scene, so we're good.

00:55:49.002 --> 00:55:51.502
- Don't get worked up over nothing.
- Look at him.

00:55:51.502 --> 00:55:53.260
Hey! You bastard!

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.400
Calm down.

00:55:58.229 --> 00:56:00.369
You weren't carrying anything in the footage.

00:56:00.369 --> 00:56:04.226
Did you dig up the hole with your hands and bury her?

00:56:04.807 --> 00:56:06.807
Maybe.

00:56:06.807 --> 00:56:08.894
I was out of it.

00:56:08.894 --> 00:56:11.201
So I don't remember how I did it.

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.397
The footage shows you leaving alone too.

00:56:15.135 --> 00:56:18.568
You looked too calm for someone who was out of it.

00:56:21.877 --> 00:56:24.744
Maybe I picked the wrong police department.

00:56:25.777 --> 00:56:28.710
There's a pretty smart detective here.

00:56:32.786 --> 00:56:39.563
So he buried Lee Dae Cheol's daughter at the place where Lee Dae Cheol buried a body.

00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:41.291
This can't be a coincidence.

00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:45.384
That's why I'm saying he has a hidden motive.

00:56:45.384 --> 00:56:48.723
There's a reason why he came to the police department where I work at.

00:56:48.723 --> 00:56:50.464
So what are we supposed to do?

00:56:50.464 --> 00:56:52.956
Think about his testimony.

00:56:52.956 --> 00:56:56.577
Does he look sane to you? He's crazy.

00:56:57.918 --> 00:57:01.549
We have to find the body in a case like this. We have no other choice.

00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:03.606
Jae Hong, get it started.

00:57:03.606 --> 00:57:05.928
Yes, sir. Let's go.

00:57:05.928 --> 00:57:09.246
Ji Woong, request backup and come with the rest of the crew.

00:57:09.246 --> 00:57:12.544
You two will wait with me until we get backup.

00:57:12.544 --> 00:57:14.107
All right.

00:57:14.107 --> 00:57:18.122
Take Park Geon Ho back to the station and keep interrogating him.

00:57:18.122 --> 00:57:20.870
Although I'm not sure if we'll get anything.

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.294
What the heck is this?

00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:25.886
What the heck is this case about?

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.720
[Incheon West Police Station]

00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:43.511
It's a bit salty.

00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:45.985
How did you first meet Lee Eun Hye?

00:57:45.985 --> 00:57:47.675
Did you approach her on purpose?

00:57:47.675 --> 00:57:51.699
How many points do you get if you solve a murder case?

00:57:51.699 --> 00:57:55.561
The inmates were very curious about that.

00:57:56.629 --> 00:57:58.529
This is different.

00:57:58.529 --> 00:58:00.550
The killer turned himself in.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:02.383
Oh, I see.

00:58:02.383 --> 00:58:06.004
Maybe I should've stayed hidden before letting you catch me.

00:58:07.793 --> 00:58:13.426
There's no reason to complicate things if you've decided to turn yourself in.

00:58:13.426 --> 00:58:14.513
Let's keep it simple.

00:58:14.513 --> 00:58:15.819
Are you begging me right now?

00:58:15.819 --> 00:58:19.636
Yes, I'm begging you. Please.

00:58:21.222 --> 00:58:26.736
Then go... find Lee Eun Hye's body first.

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.122
What?

00:58:28.122 --> 00:58:30.723
Why do you need me to spoon-feed you everything?

00:58:30.723 --> 00:58:33.066
Go find the body

00:58:33.066 --> 00:58:34.794
and the murder weapon.

00:58:34.794 --> 00:58:38.875
And collect the blood sample and come to me with the DNA comparison,

00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:41.351
then I'll tell you everything.

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.547
Right?

00:58:51.877 --> 00:58:53.677
Hey.

00:58:53.677 --> 00:58:56.711
I wanted to ask you something.

00:58:56.711 --> 00:58:57.999
Are you busy?

00:58:57.999 --> 00:59:00.729
You should have time for a quick chat.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.910
Baekho Road 472 in South Dongu, Incheon.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:19.986
Eunbang Road 212 in Jungu, Incheon.

00:59:19.986 --> 00:59:23.638
Do you... remember these addresses?

00:59:23.638 --> 00:59:26.706
The second location is where you said that you buried Lee Eun Hye.

00:59:26.706 --> 00:59:30.130
If you drove there, you should remember putting it in the navigator.

00:59:35.519 --> 00:59:39.914
You read over the question I gave you carefully.

00:59:39.914 --> 00:59:42.398
I'll give you a hint as a reward.

00:59:43.365 --> 00:59:45.765
"You snakes.

00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:48.599
You brood of vipers.

00:59:48.599 --> 00:59:52.327
How will you escape being condemned to hell?"

00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:57.000
Matthew 23:33.

01:00:03.535 --> 01:00:07.214
Yes, we haven't confirmed the identity yet.

01:00:07.214 --> 01:00:10.756
But it looks like a female high school student.

01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:13.176
Okay, got it.

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:17.425
I know it's a hassle, but can you send me the address of the crime scene?

01:00:17.425 --> 01:00:20.242
I need to go there and confirm something.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.049
Thanks.

01:00:31.168 --> 01:00:33.871
You told us to find the body ourselves, right?

01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:35.934
What was your motive behind that?

01:00:35.934 --> 01:00:39.120
You appeared in the footage with Lee Eun Hye on purpose, right?

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.777
To create an alibi.

01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:48.213
Where did you really kill Lee Eun Hye?

01:00:54.339 --> 01:00:58.406
Eunbang Road 212 in Jungu, Incheon.

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:07.391
He turned himself in on purpose.

01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:09.195
I think you're right, but—

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:14.950
He's going to keep claiming that he killed Lee Eun Hye and buried her in that field.

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:18.651
But if the body found at the beach turns out to be Lee Eun Hye,

01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:20.231
what do you think he'll say?

01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:24.028
He'll probably say that he didn't kill her, saying that he thought he had killed her.

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:27.491
That's what Park Geon Ho is after.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:36.277
I love the place where you are and where your grace abounds.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:41.495
Please do not take up my soul and my life with the criminal.

01:01:41.495 --> 01:01:46.944
Park Geon Ho targeted Lee Eun Hye from the start.

01:01:46.944 --> 01:01:50.344
Why do you think he killed her?

01:01:51.387 --> 01:01:53.464
I'm sure we'll find the reason in Lee Dae Cheol.

01:01:53.464 --> 01:01:59.121
So why take out a grudge against Lee Dae Cheol on his innocent daughter?

01:01:59.121 --> 01:02:01.277
That evil bastard.

01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:03.205
Be strong and bold.

01:02:03.205 --> 01:02:04.687
Do not be afraid.

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.158
Don't shake in fear in front of them.

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:19.908
The Lord will be with you. He will never leave you or abandon you.

Have you ever killed someone?

01:02:46.633 --> 01:02:48.898
You're worse than a pig! Die!

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:50.030
Do you know what it feels like?

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.436
Why did you kill her? Tell me why, you bastard?

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.020
This is not related to our case at all.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.196
- I'm sure she's changed a lot.
- If I say it's not her, then it isn't her!

01:02:57.196 --> 01:02:59.714
I said I did it. I killed someone!

01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:02.303
I told you to keep it quiet!

01:03:02.303 --> 01:03:04.318
Reporters, I have something to tell you!

01:03:04.318 --> 01:03:07.112
That murder isn't my dad! Is he?

01:03:07.112 --> 01:03:08.210
I'll do whatever you say.

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:09.366
Do you know Lee Dae Cheol?

01:03:09.366 --> 01:03:10.933
He's innocent.

01:03:10.933 --> 01:03:14.232
Are you confident that Lee Dae Cheol is the real killer?

01:03:14.232 --> 01:03:15.802
I have something to report.

01:03:15.802 --> 01:03:18.426
Take a look and decide for yourself.
