00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.579
Miss!

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.390
Here.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.650
That's right.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.364
Yes, Hyeongnim.

00:00:56.364 --> 00:00:58.765
We got Oh Jong Tae's DNA.

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.629
We'll take it straight to the forensics lab and get it tested.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:01.821
Okay.

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.750
Tell them it's urgent and ask them to speed it up.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.359
Yes, sir.

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:09.423
Hyeongnim.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:14.479
This is our station's vehicle entry log for the day Jang Jin Soo was murdered.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.859
Nam Gook Hyeon's car was parked in the morning and exited the lot the next night.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.609
There's a chance Nam Gook Hyeon was lying when he testified that Jang Jin Soo went to

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.023
arrest Lee Dae Cheol by himself while he was tracking down Lee Dae Cheol's whereabouts.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:34.075
You're saying Jang Jin Soo and Nam Gook Hyeon were together in the same car, that day?

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:37.342
This is Nam Gook Hyeon's credit card history from five years ago.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:40.466
He bought cigarettes from a store that was five minutes away from the scene.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:44.157
It matches the time of the murder.

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:46.758
Did you look into Oh Jong Tae's alibi?

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.839
Yes, he attended an opening ceremony for the Busan Hotel with Uncle.

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:51.445
People saw him there.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.086
And there's almost zero chance that Jong Tae

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:57.716
could've left an event with Uncle right next to him.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:00.320
Once we get the DNA results,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.384
we'll be sure that Jong Tae is the one who killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:08.909
All we have left to do is find out who killed Jang Jin Soo.

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:19.807
Let's supplement the prosecutions' article with statements from congressmen.

Toss it to the politics team and ask them to do it.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.541
Yes, sir.

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:28.245
Any updates on Kim Gi Tae's trials?

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:30.279
No, nothing much.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.594
Did you meet with him?

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:33.618
I only spoke to him on the phone.

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:38.353
He asked me to tell you that he's praying fervently and wants you to go easy on him.

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:41.836
I don't know why he keeps involving me in his business.

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:43.469
That's it for today.

00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:49.158
I guess you didn't go home last night. Were you here all night?

00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:50.165
Yes.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:53.114
I personally received a tip for a story.

00:03:01.726 --> 00:03:03.543
Seonbae.

00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:06.060
I need to ask you something.

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.689
Do you remember that report?
[Team Report]

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.906
It was when you were reporting on the police.

00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:14.406
Yes.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.990
Why were you trying to find Jo Seong Gi?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.136
It was when Senior Manager Yoo was working the desk.

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:23.517
The headquarters told us to look into Jo Seong Gi.

00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:28.523
Did Senior Manager Yoo go to Gawol Church to find Jo Seong Gi after the report?

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:30.383
I don't know.

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:34.178
Senior Manager Yoo wrote that he took a business trip on the log,

00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:35.719
so he did go to see him.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.219
Right?

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.609
Why did Senior Manager Yoo go see him?

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.993
Why are you asking me instead of Senior Manager Yoo?

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:45.632
What?

00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:49.056
Is there a reason you can't ask him directly?

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.299
No.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.645
I'll ask him myself.

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:56.242
Did you get the information from the police for that report?

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:58.376
I just need you to confirm that.

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:01.236
Thanks.

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:02.756
I'm not sure.

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.139
I don't know anymore.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.031
Do you remember the murder that happened five years ago near the town's entrance?

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:09.992
They found a body in the field.

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.634
Yes, of course, I remember.

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:14.217
Did you see this man on that day?

00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:15.709
Who is this man?

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.311
He's a journalist.

00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:19.081
From Jeonghan Daily News.

00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:23.800
Oh, a journalist did come to see our pastor that day.

00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:28.151
I'm not sure if it was this man, though.

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:33.209
But I think he said he was from Jeonghan Daily.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.100
Is that so?

What are we supposed to start with?

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:27.036
45 people live in this town here.

00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.385
And there are 17 people who could've passed by

00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:32.108
this place or witnessed the murder on that day.

00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:36.109
Out of those 17, eight were either children or elderly who couldn't move around.

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:38.720
I've confirmed the addresses of the remaining nine.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.962
Maybe we'll get something if we interview them.

00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:44.146
Hey, when did you figure that out?

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:48.975
And I noticed something interesting when I looked into the report records.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:53.078
There was a man named Kim Gwang Hoon who used to be a pastor at Gawol Church over there.

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:55.670
After the murder, he was reported missing.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.507
So I think we need to investigate whether it has something to do with our case.

What the hell is Team 2 looking into?

I don't know the specifics,

00:07:19.004 --> 00:07:22.257
but I think they found new evidence regarding Lee Dae Cheol's case.

00:07:22.257 --> 00:07:24.381
Evidence?

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.460
What kind of evidence?

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:27.810
They've been going to the lab a lot.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.670
So it must be something like DNA.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.970
Really?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.725
Can you find out what exactly they submitted to the lab?

00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:42.239
Do you, by any chance, remember the name of the detective who came earlier?

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:45.332
I'm not sure. I did look at his ID.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:48.678
I think it said Nam... something.

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:50.678
- Nam Gook Hyeon?
- Yes, that's right.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.735
What did he ask about?

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:56.280
He showed me a picture and asked me about a man.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.387
Yes, is this Pastor Kim Gwang Hoon?

00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:04.064
Did you work at Gawol Church in Incheon by any chance?

00:08:06.164 --> 00:08:07.334

There are no other pastors named Kim Gwang Hoon to look into, right?

Yes.

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:24.008
Does that mean he used a fake name?

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:25.408

00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:06.571
One of the two men who brought me all the way here.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.905
Did you read the email I sent you?

00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:34.731
I'm sure that's why you came here.

00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.588
Yes, I read it.

00:11:36.588 --> 00:11:39.986
But that's just one of my daily tasks.

00:11:39.986 --> 00:11:42.491
November 9th, 2015.

00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:46.916
Reporter Yoo from Jeonghan Daily News came here to investigate a story.

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:51.781
I'm sure that was one of the daily reports you received during that time.

00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.472
Do you remember the note you wrote on the document?

00:11:54.472 --> 00:11:56.582
"Jang Jin Soo."

00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:02.547
November 9th is when Detective Jang is presumed to have been murdered.

00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:06.163
Reporter Yoo visited this church on that day.

00:12:06.163 --> 00:12:10.634
It's only five minutes away from where Detective Jang was murdered.

00:12:10.634 --> 00:12:13.826
You were the prosecutor in charge at the time.

00:12:13.826 --> 00:12:17.346
It was the reason why you connected Reporter Yoo to Jang Jin Soo.

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:22.169
Anyone would be suspicious, under these circumstances.

00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:24.031
Senior Manager Yoo.

00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:28.727
Do you remember handing me the documents proving Prosecutor Kim's corruption?

00:12:28.727 --> 00:12:34.529
And do you remember telling me to find the real killer because Lee Dae Cheol is innocent?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.276
Why did you set this up?

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:42.053
What are you trying to gain from this?

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.519
You two have something in common.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:47.347
You both used me.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:50.398
One guy used me to get rid of a prosecutor who was in the way

00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.357
of his brother becoming a minister.

00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:57.549
And the other guy used me to get something on the man who investigated his corruption.

00:12:57.549 --> 00:13:02.572
The problem is that I have come closer to finding out the truth while being used.

00:13:02.572 --> 00:13:04.690
Do you know who Jo Seong Gi is?

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:08.855
I'm sorry to bring up your painful past.

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:11.490
But you know very well that a journalist must

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.725
play a villain's role at a time like this.

00:13:15.692 --> 00:13:19.447
When Yoo Jeong Ryeol was the student body president in 1987,

00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:23.937
his sister committed suicide after the police interrogated her about who raped and tortured her.

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:27.052
The cop who raped and tortured her was Jo Seong Gi.

00:13:27.052 --> 00:13:29.485
On November 9th, 2015,

00:13:29.485 --> 00:13:34.410
you met with Jo Seong Gi who was using a fake name Kim Gwang Hoon at this church, right?

00:13:36.568 --> 00:13:38.537
I'm sure you know about it too.

00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:43.004
He was the brother of Jo Seong Dae, the man who ran your errands.

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:46.222
Jo Seong Gi is missing right now.

00:13:46.222 --> 00:13:49.146
What happened between you two that day?

00:13:49.146 --> 00:13:52.113
He has been on the wanted list.

00:13:53.223 --> 00:13:57.286
How can we say that he's missing just because he went into hiding?

00:13:57.286 --> 00:14:01.516
Why did his brother, Jo Seong Dae, work for you?

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:06.000
Isn't it because you wanted to know the truth about

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.101
what happened between Senior Manager Yoo and Jo Seong Gi, that day?

00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:12.472
That was my intention at first,

00:14:12.472 --> 00:14:15.422
but he knew nothing about his brother.

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:21.746
I had him work for me because it was easy to control him since he was a criminal.

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:24.169
Prosecutor Kim.

00:14:28.754 --> 00:14:32.722
So you set everything up.

00:14:32.722 --> 00:14:36.186
You pulled out evidence proving Lee Dae Cheol's innocence to prompt a reinvestigation.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.318
And you wanted to take revenge on me and my brother

00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:42.879
by trying to reveal that I was involved, right?

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:48.138
So, what have you found out so far?

00:14:48.162 --> 00:14:52.351
Are you saying that I killed someone?

00:15:01.457 --> 00:15:03.600
I know you're not someone

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.870
who can commit murder.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.205
I've known you since you were little.

00:15:10.205 --> 00:15:11.341
Then why?

00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:15.776
I wasn't trying to reveal who killed who.

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:19.817
I want to reveal who pushed for Lee Dae Cheol's execution.

00:15:19.817 --> 00:15:24.517
Then Yoo Jeong Ryeol will have to step down as minister,

00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:27.433
and your career will be over too.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:43.130
Does that accomplish your goal for calling me here?

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.144
This will make things more difficult for my trial.

00:15:58.201 --> 00:16:03.099
You must be confident about your decision, seeing how far you've pushed me.

00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:04.629
What have you decided?

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:07.507
You're helping Oh Jong Tae.

00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:09.235
Why exactly?

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:11.609
Is it because you're afraid they'll reinvestigate

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:15.746
Detective Jang's murder once they find out Oh Jong Tae is the real killer?

00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:20.490
Why do you think I need to answer that question?

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.399
An innocent man died.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.659
I knew that Lee Dae Cheol was innocent

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:28.790
but I did nothing about it as a journalist.

00:16:29.325 --> 00:16:32.340
I know it's late, but I want to find out the truth

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.394
and who the real murderer is.

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:36.518
Do it.

00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:38.999
Do whatever it takes to find out who it is.

00:16:39.948 --> 00:16:43.648
I'll put it on the front page with your name on it.

00:16:55.582 --> 00:16:57.731
- Hello?
- Is Reporter Jin next to you?

00:16:57.731 --> 00:16:59.582
No, it's just me.

00:16:59.582 --> 00:17:01.054
I just didn't want any misunderstanding.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:04.174
I had no choice but to say that in that situation.

00:17:04.174 --> 00:17:06.455
What is it that you want to confirm?

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:08.954
I have no choice but to be on your side.

00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:11.428
I just want you to know that.

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:13.958
Let's talk in person later.

00:17:31.393 --> 00:17:33.885
How did it go? Are we able to visit Jo Seong Dae in prison?

00:17:33.885 --> 00:17:36.052
Yes, we can go right now.

00:17:36.052 --> 00:17:37.653
Why were you here?

00:17:37.653 --> 00:17:39.553
Let me ask one question.

00:17:39.553 --> 00:17:43.775
Who do you think killed Detective Jang?

00:17:49.856 --> 00:17:53.292
Why do you think it was Team Leader Nam?

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:55.841
We've confirmed Oh Jong Tae's alibi.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:59.942
And we've confirmed that Nam Gook Hyeon was with Detective Jang on that day.

00:17:59.942 --> 00:18:00.946
What about the motive?

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:04.965
Jang Jin Soo had evidence that proved Oh Jong Tae was the real killer.

00:18:04.965 --> 00:18:08.822
Nam Gook Hyeon found out and killed him because of it.

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:14.248
And there's a chance Oh Jong Tae told him to do it.

00:18:14.248 --> 00:18:19.680
By any chance, did you know that Senior Manager Yoo was near the crime scene?

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:21.646
How did you know that?

00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:23.275
So you did know.

00:18:23.275 --> 00:18:25.303
I just confirmed it.

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:27.167
Senior Manager Yoo was definitely there.

00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:29.086
And I've obtained proof that shows he was there.

00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:31.986
Did Senior Manager Yoo admit it?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:32.788
Yes.

00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:38.165
Did he tell you why he met with Pastor Kim Gwang Hoon at Gawol Church?

00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:40.608
His name is Jo Seong Gi, not Kim Gwang Hoon.

00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:42.675
He was using a fake name.

00:18:42.675 --> 00:18:44.895
The man you asked me to look up earlier?

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:46.195
Yes.

00:18:46.195 --> 00:18:49.328
He was wanted for raping and torturing in an investigation 30 years ago.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:53.632
Yoo Jeong Seok's older sister was the victim.

00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:04.760
His sister who died in 1987?
[Yoo Jeong Seon]

00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:07.165
Yoo Jeong Seon?

00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:12.309
Is Jo Seong Gi your older brother?

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:15.826
He was a cop and is missing now.

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:19.687
How did you first meet Kim Gi Tae?

00:19:19.687 --> 00:19:23.209
Did he approach you because he knew you were his brother?

00:19:23.209 --> 00:19:25.676
Did Kim Gi Tae order you to do it?

00:19:25.676 --> 00:19:27.496
He told you to look into Lee Dae Cheol's case

00:19:27.496 --> 00:19:30.719
because it had something to do with your brother, right?

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:33.910
And you found out that Oh Jong Tae is the real killer.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.625
You used that to get money from Oh Jong Tae, and you two became accomplices.

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:42.223
That explains why Oh JongTae tried to kill Lee Dae Cheol in prison.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.967
When you figured out the truth, Oh Jong Tae was afraid

00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:48.963
the world would find out that he was the real killer.

00:19:48.963 --> 00:19:52.927
So he tried to kill Lee Dae Cheol in prison. Right?

00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:57.414
We found proof that Oh Jong Tae killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:19:57.414 --> 00:20:00.199
When we get the lab results, we'll have Oh Jong Tae's

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.675
motive for conspiring to kill Park Geon Ho.

00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:05.780
It's only a matter of time before you two will be on trial.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.959
You need to cooperate to reduce your sentence.

00:20:13.389 --> 00:20:17.889
Good for you. You found out the truth.

00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:22.770
Where is your brother right now? Are you in contact with him?

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.815
He's dead.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:29.640
He might be in hiding because he's wanted by the police.

00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:33.373
I owe my brother money,

00:20:33.373 --> 00:20:36.146
but he hasn't contacted me for it.

00:20:36.146 --> 00:20:38.943
All he cares about is money.

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:42.565
It means someone killed him.

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:45.256
He did commit a lot of crimes.

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:48.718
When was the last time you talked to him?

00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:53.259
It was when he was a pastor at a church.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:55.747
I told him I would pay him back.

00:20:55.747 --> 00:21:00.489
And he told me he would call me back after he set up an account for deposits.

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:03.704
But that was the last time I heard from him.

00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:05.945
What's the exact date?

00:21:07.772 --> 00:21:09.568
On that day.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.526
That day when...

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:16.311
the detective from your team got killed.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:26.193
How come the cops didn't do anything when Jo Seong Gi was reported missing?

00:21:26.193 --> 00:21:29.426
They couldn't find him because it was filed under his fake name.

00:21:29.426 --> 00:21:32.645
If Jo Seong Gi really died that day like Jo Seong Dae said...

00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:37.165
That would make Yoo Jeong Seok the main suspect.

00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:39.682
I think we need to find Jo Seong Gi first,

00:21:39.682 --> 00:21:43.130
then we'll be able to solve Jang Jin Soo's murder too.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.620
So, the person who killed Jang Jin Soo is also...

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:52.090
If it happened at the same place, there's a good chance it was the same person.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.206
It's too early to say that.

00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:01.134
Hey.

00:22:01.134 --> 00:22:03.686
We already have our hands full with Oh Jong Tae.

00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:06.731
Why do we have to bring a manager of Jeonghan Daily News into this?

00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:08.961
Don't you think you're taking this too far?

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:11.579
We've already come this far.

00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:13.620
We need to see it through to the end.

00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:20.819
Then let's have the Seoul headquarters or the branch office handle Yoo Jeong Seok.

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:25.653
This is not something a country bumpkin sergeant can handle.

00:22:25.653 --> 00:22:28.044
That's why he can do it.

00:22:30.104 --> 00:22:33.748
The smart people wouldn't even touch it.

00:22:33.748 --> 00:22:38.567
Seonbae can do it because he doesn't care.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.758
Are you hanging in there?

00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:43.935
Of course.

00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:46.000
I've worked really hard to get to where I am.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.852
Right.

00:22:46.852 --> 00:22:50.080
You should go all the way to the top and

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.780
get revenge on the guys who did this to you.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.428
This is a hurdle I need to get over.

00:22:56.428 --> 00:23:01.227
In order to do that, I need something big.

Wouldn't it be better to keep a low profile instead?

Do you know why I went to the auditing department?

It's because it holds all of the organization's information.

Information is what you need to make the weak strong, and the strong weak.

00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:57.163
What is it that you found?

00:34:57.163 --> 00:34:59.769
Why are you changing the direction of the investigation?

00:34:59.769 --> 00:35:04.103
I know that you've been contacting Oh Jong Tae's father, Oh Jeong Soo.

00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:09.122
Have you been doing a background check on your partner?

00:35:09.122 --> 00:35:12.407
Lee Dae Cheol has a rock-solid alibi.

00:35:12.407 --> 00:35:14.756
What? Do you have something?

00:35:14.756 --> 00:35:16.093
Tell me the truth.

00:35:16.093 --> 00:35:17.975
Did you receive something from Oh Jeong Soo?

00:35:17.975 --> 00:35:21.473
Did he pay you to exclude his son from the investigation? Tell me!

00:35:21.473 --> 00:35:23.173
Hyeongnim.

00:35:23.173 --> 00:35:24.907
Jin Soo Hyeong!

00:35:24.907 --> 00:35:27.490
This is a misunderstanding.

00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:29.822
Lee Dae Cheol is the killer.

00:35:29.846 --> 00:35:32.469
I found evidence that proves Oh Jong Tae is the real killer.

00:35:32.469 --> 00:35:35.185
I'll submit it to the National Forensic Lab right away.

00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:38.297
The results will prove that Oh Jong Tae is the killer.

00:35:38.297 --> 00:35:40.197
So why?

00:35:40.197 --> 00:35:42.732
Why did you set up an innocent man?

00:35:42.756 --> 00:35:43.914
Why?

00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:45.315
Hyeong.

00:35:47.262 --> 00:35:49.918
Lee Dae Cheol is a bad man.

00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:52.381
He would've killed someone sooner or later.

00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:53.581
What?

00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:56.447
I was going to tell you this later.

00:35:57.767 --> 00:36:01.225
Hyeong, if things go well with this,

00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:03.474
it will change our lives.

00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:05.841
What did you just say?

00:36:07.024 --> 00:36:08.724
Come here!

00:36:13.498 --> 00:36:15.390
Get up.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.192
I had really no idea you were this dirty!

00:36:21.192 --> 00:36:22.364
Let me finish.

00:36:22.364 --> 00:36:23.475
No!

00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:26.423
You're worse than a murderer, you bastard.

00:36:26.423 --> 00:36:29.957
How can you frame an innocent man for murder?

00:36:29.957 --> 00:36:32.924
You're supposed to be a detective!

00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:02.405
Okay.

00:37:03.793 --> 00:37:05.593
I'm sorry.

00:37:05.593 --> 00:37:07.439
Hyeong.

00:37:08.316 --> 00:37:10.809
I must've lost my mind for a second.

00:37:12.184 --> 00:37:17.511
I'll return everything to its place.

00:37:18.743 --> 00:37:20.643
Forgive me.

00:37:21.536 --> 00:37:23.294
Forgive me just this once.

00:37:23.294 --> 00:37:26.952
Gook Hyeon, this isn't you.

00:37:27.477 --> 00:37:29.744
Why would you do that?

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.560
Hyeongnim.

00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.397
I think it will be hard to do anything now.

00:37:47.363 --> 00:37:49.856
- What?
- Team 2 is almost done.

00:37:49.856 --> 00:37:52.183
They'll reveal the truth of Lee Dae Cheol's case soon,

00:37:52.183 --> 00:37:55.576
and they'll find out what you did.

00:37:56.344 --> 00:37:57.909
What is it that you think I did?

00:37:57.926 --> 00:38:01.924
I thought Do Chang was framing you, at first.

00:38:01.924 --> 00:38:03.794
But he's not.

00:38:03.794 --> 00:38:05.588
Do Chang is not playing around.

00:38:05.588 --> 00:38:10.554
He's going to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of it.

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.702
What do you think they'll find?

00:38:13.702 --> 00:38:16.279
You think they can touch me?

00:38:16.279 --> 00:38:20.633
Them touch me?

00:38:26.298 --> 00:38:29.132
How did you find the skeletal remains?

00:38:29.132 --> 00:38:33.368
He might not be able to make friends with the living, but he's close with the dead.

00:38:33.368 --> 00:38:35.768
He's an expert at finding bodies.

00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:39.749
How are you going to proceed with the case?

00:38:39.749 --> 00:38:42.432
We'll have to investigate why Jo Seong Gi died.

00:38:42.432 --> 00:38:48.343
I think solving this case will also solve Jang Jin Soo's murder.

00:38:48.343 --> 00:38:50.005
What are you going to do?

00:38:50.005 --> 00:38:51.762
Are you going to write about it?

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:55.377
We'll confirm the identity once we get the DNA results from the remains.

00:38:55.377 --> 00:38:59.037
If it is really Jo Seong Gi, we'll find out who killed him.

00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:01.855
Will you be able to write about it at Jeonghan Daily?

00:39:01.855 --> 00:39:03.722
I'll have to write about it.

00:39:04.381 --> 00:39:06.882
It will be a Jeonghan Daily exclusive.

00:39:06.882 --> 00:39:11.400
Now I get why Yoo Jeong Seok tried

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.460
so hard to bury this case.

00:39:14.468 --> 00:39:20.839
Do you think he really killed Jang Jin Soo too?

00:39:20.839 --> 00:39:26.110
If he had killed Jo Seong Gi, he would've not been in his right mind.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.265
It's possible.

00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:29.719
Let's write up a report first.

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:33.315
Let's hold off on reporting it to the prosecution.

00:39:33.315 --> 00:39:35.208
Okay.

00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:38.501
Hello?

00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:41.999
Please go ahead.

00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:44.630
It's me, Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:39:45.336 --> 00:39:47.336
Where are you right now?

00:39:47.336 --> 00:39:51.396
Why do you keep harassing me?

00:39:51.396 --> 00:39:53.811
We know everything that you did. Come here.

00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:55.435
Let's talk in person.

00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:58.582
You can come defend yourself if you like.

00:39:58.582 --> 00:40:01.882
I'm too busy to come all the way there.

00:40:03.127 --> 00:40:06.500
You can do whatever you want,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.417
but don't get me involved.

00:40:09.417 --> 00:40:13.022
Nothing good will come out of us fighting against each other.

00:40:13.022 --> 00:40:14.261
Just come here─

00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:15.561
Hyeongnim.

00:40:15.561 --> 00:40:20.444
Didn't you say you hate it when someone else suffers because of you? Right?

00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:22.520
Let's both be careful so that doesn't happen.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.614
Hey! You... Nam Gook Hyeon!

00:40:33.246 --> 00:40:35.477
Do what?

00:40:37.321 --> 00:40:40.841
Just take a break until you hear about your disciplinary action.

00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:44.717
I'll accept whatever the superiors decide on.

00:40:44.717 --> 00:40:47.199
I won't file any complaints.

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:49.922
So give me one last chance in exchange.

00:40:49.922 --> 00:40:52.602
I already gave you a chance!

00:40:52.602 --> 00:40:55.553
And what have you gotten from the West Division so far?

00:40:55.553 --> 00:40:58.996
You only said there were no issues. You didn't do anything.

00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:04.286
The reason I hesitated was because I was looking for something big.

00:41:04.286 --> 00:41:06.853
I've finally found something.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.263
No one knows more about the West Division than me.

00:41:11.263 --> 00:41:14.696
I ended up like this because of the West Division.

00:41:15.327 --> 00:41:17.393
I need to get back at them.

00:41:18.922 --> 00:41:25.488
If you don't find anything again, your disciplinary action will become harsher.

00:41:25.488 --> 00:41:27.624
Proceed with that in mind.

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:38.082
1,500 won (~$1.50), please.

00:41:39.749 --> 00:41:42.032
You look familiar.

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.775
Where have I seen you before?

00:41:45.353 --> 00:41:49.420
Go home and tell the following to the person you live with.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.363
Tell him that a man warned you to be careful

00:41:52.363 --> 00:41:55.029
because you're too pretty to go unnoticed.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.016
Take care.

00:42:03.262 --> 00:42:05.862
Excuse me, sir! Wait a second!

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:20.966
Ahjussi. It's you, right?

00:42:21.716 --> 00:42:25.131
The man who placed the evidence in my dad's car.

00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:26.998
It's you, right?

00:42:26.998 --> 00:42:29.153
I know it's you, Ahjussi.

00:42:29.153 --> 00:42:30.886
I don't know.

00:42:31.861 --> 00:42:34.695
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:42:36.376 --> 00:42:38.809
You're the one who made my dad die.

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:43.034
My dad had to die because of you!

00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:47.297
You're up to no good.

00:42:47.297 --> 00:42:50.206
Don't say stuff like that,

00:42:50.206 --> 00:42:51.451
or else...

00:42:51.451 --> 00:42:54.350
Ahjussi, please!

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.928
Ahjussi. Ahjussi, I'm begging you!

00:43:04.928 --> 00:43:09.078
Please tell them that my dad is innocent!

00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:11.622
Ahjussi, please!

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:14.419
You know the truth!

00:43:14.419 --> 00:43:16.804
Please!

00:43:21.522 --> 00:43:23.569
You bastard!

00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:25.813
Bring my dad back to me!

00:43:25.813 --> 00:43:29.764
Tell them that my dad is innocent!

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.554
[Skeletal remains presumed to be Jo, a missing former cop]

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.945
I didn't write this in the report,

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:59.548
but a burnt car was found at the scene before the remains were found.

00:43:59.548 --> 00:44:02.028
And the car belonged to Gawol Church.

00:44:02.028 --> 00:44:07.309
Jo was working at Gawol Church as a pastor under a fake name.

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:10.886
He went missing after the burnt car was found.

00:44:10.886 --> 00:44:13.027
The circumstances confirm that these are the facts.

00:44:13.027 --> 00:44:15.071
Did the police reveal his real name?

00:44:15.071 --> 00:44:17.755
They'll reveal it once they finish the autopsy.

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:20.204
Is this really an exclusive for us?

00:44:20.204 --> 00:44:24.162
Yes. They said they'll do the press briefing if we don't write about it.

00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:26.514
Why would the police do that for us?

00:44:26.514 --> 00:44:28.978
I was at the scene when the remains were found.

00:44:28.978 --> 00:44:33.545
I asked them at the scene to let us take the exclusive.

00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:36.485
Senior Manager, this works.

00:44:36.485 --> 00:44:38.912
Let's write it as an exclusive.

00:44:48.351 --> 00:44:50.484
Let's publish it tomorrow.

00:44:56.385 --> 00:44:59.251
- Where's Eun Hye?
- In her room.

00:45:02.179 --> 00:45:04.384
Eun Hye, are you okay? What happened?

00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:07.018
Ahjussi, I remember now.

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:12.659
That person... I remember the man who put the evidence in my dad's car.

00:45:12.659 --> 00:45:13.772
Who is it?

00:45:13.772 --> 00:45:17.146
It's the guy I saw on the screen during the trial.

00:45:17.146 --> 00:45:20.533
The detective who investigated my dad. I'm sure.

00:45:20.533 --> 00:45:22.014
Nam Gook Hyeon?

00:45:22.014 --> 00:45:25.252
Yes. He came to the convenience store earlier.

00:45:25.252 --> 00:45:28.637
I remembered when I saw his face.

00:45:28.637 --> 00:45:30.988
I remembered him.

00:45:30.988 --> 00:45:32.560
That bastard.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.828
Ahjussi, can we request a retrial now?

00:45:36.828 --> 00:45:42.317
If I say that the man was him, will it prove my dad's innocence?

00:45:42.317 --> 00:45:44.164
Please let us have a trial again.

00:45:44.164 --> 00:45:46.336
Eun Hye, the thing is...

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.727
What? We need to hurry up and have a trial again!

00:45:49.727 --> 00:45:52.978
I remembered him when I saw him.

00:45:52.978 --> 00:45:56.635
We need to prove my dad's innocence, Ahjussi.

00:45:57.275 --> 00:46:02.961
Eun Hye, we can't hold trials just because we want to.

00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:06.985
Oppa. I need to talk to you for a second.

00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:24.798
Why didn't you tell me?

00:46:24.798 --> 00:46:27.124
I heard she has epilepsy.

00:46:27.124 --> 00:46:29.173
It's not a serious illness─

00:46:29.173 --> 00:46:32.335
I talked to the doctor.

00:46:32.335 --> 00:46:34.919
She might go blind.

00:46:34.919 --> 00:46:36.242
What?

00:46:36.242 --> 00:46:37.441
Why?

00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:39.738
If she keeps collapsing...

00:46:41.326 --> 00:46:42.899
What did he say, again?

00:46:42.899 --> 00:46:45.703
If her blood pressure spikes, it can damage her optic nerve.

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:49.003
Anyway! It is serious.

00:46:49.003 --> 00:46:52.593
Why did you bring her here?

00:46:52.593 --> 00:46:57.069
It's hard to take care of a normal kid. What are you trying to do with a sick kid?

00:46:57.069 --> 00:47:00.619
What if something goes wrong and she goes blind?

00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:03.291
Do you think you can take care of her for the rest of your life?

00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:05.491
That can't happen.

00:47:06.314 --> 00:47:07.969
She's going to go to art school.

00:47:07.987 --> 00:47:10.420
She can't lose her sight.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.244
Art school?

00:47:12.244 --> 00:47:14.106
She's going to go to art school?

00:47:14.106 --> 00:47:17.627
Do you know how expensive art schools are?

00:47:17.627 --> 00:47:19.441
You wouldn't be able to afford it!

00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:22.316
I have to take care of her.

00:47:22.316 --> 00:47:25.218
- Why? Why you?
- Gosh.

00:47:25.887 --> 00:47:28.331
I promised Lee Dae Cheol!

00:47:28.331 --> 00:47:31.812
I promised him that I'll walk her down the aisle when she gets married.

00:47:31.836 --> 00:47:33.336
Why?

00:47:33.336 --> 00:47:36.212
Why did you make that promise? Why you?

00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:38.097
Because I made Lee Dae Cheol die!

00:47:38.097 --> 00:47:39.798
I made her innocent dad die!

00:47:39.798 --> 00:47:41.865
Was it your fault?

00:47:41.865 --> 00:47:43.378
It's not.

00:47:43.378 --> 00:47:49.030
It's not your fault, so why do you have to take on a burden like her?

00:47:50.356 --> 00:47:52.056
Eun Hui.

00:47:52.981 --> 00:47:58.006
Hey. Every time I think of Lee Dae Cheol,

00:47:58.006 --> 00:48:01.750
it feels like there's a needle stabbing my heart.

00:48:03.978 --> 00:48:06.578
Even if she tries to run away from me,

00:48:07.275 --> 00:48:10.141
I have to hold on to her,

00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:14.727
so I won't be in pain.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.206
I'm not taking care of Eun Hye.

00:48:19.919 --> 00:48:22.653
Eun Hye is taking care of me.

00:48:32.816 --> 00:48:35.016
We can't do anything about it.

00:48:35.016 --> 00:48:36.790
That's how retrials are.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.759
If it gets dismissed,

00:48:39.759 --> 00:48:42.382
we can't hold another trial for it.

00:48:42.382 --> 00:48:45.211
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.430
My dad died because I couldn't

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.170
remember the man's face.

00:48:53.002 --> 00:48:55.735
How am I supposed to live with myself?

00:48:56.975 --> 00:48:59.478
My dad died because of me.

00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:02.274
I told you it's not your fault.

00:49:02.854 --> 00:49:04.605
You've─

00:49:07.473 --> 00:49:10.906
You've just made up the reason yourself.

00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:13.637
Don't lock yourself up in the hell you've created,

00:49:13.637 --> 00:49:17.312
or else you won't be able to survive.

00:49:30.195 --> 00:49:34.947
Nam Gook Hyeon called me earlier.

00:49:34.947 --> 00:49:36.595
I was wondering what he was saying.

00:49:36.595 --> 00:49:40.458
But he meant that he'll harm Eun Hye if I don't stop chasing after him.

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:43.625
Nam Gook Hyeon must be very nervous right now.

00:49:43.625 --> 00:49:45.705
We're closing in on him.

00:49:45.705 --> 00:49:50.037
I won't let him get away with this.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:55.963
Eun Hye might lose her eyesight because of him.

00:49:55.963 --> 00:50:00.856
Her dream is to become a painter.

00:50:00.856 --> 00:50:03.405
You don't need to worry about that.

00:50:03.405 --> 00:50:05.252
We can treat her eyes,

00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.196
and we'll send her to art school.

00:50:07.196 --> 00:50:09.296
It's easier said than done.

00:50:09.296 --> 00:50:12.101
The reality sucks.

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.568
I had to pay a lot in property taxes this year.

00:50:20.568 --> 00:50:23.269
And a lot in interest income tax too.

00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:31.382
I can't believe you're bringing up taxes to show off your wealth.

00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:34.601
You really suck! Get out of here!

00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:41.431
My accountant said making a donation will reduce my taxes.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:47.163
I've been thinking about where I should donate my money to.

00:50:48.506 --> 00:50:51.447
Why... Where do you want to donate to?

00:50:51.447 --> 00:50:54.330
No need to look far.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.151
There's one right there.

00:50:56.151 --> 00:51:00.277
Everyone has someone around them to donate to. There's one right there.

00:51:00.301 --> 00:51:01.559
There's no need to look far.

00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:03.259
You're right.

00:51:04.753 --> 00:51:06.986
I didn't think about that.

00:51:06.986 --> 00:51:08.873
This guy!

00:51:08.873 --> 00:51:12.646
You've got a good head on your shoulders.

00:51:12.646 --> 00:51:14.940
I'm so proud of you.

00:51:17.011 --> 00:51:18.780
- You're getting a call.
- What?

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.996
Your phone.

00:51:19.996 --> 00:51:22.853
How did you hear that?

00:51:23.659 --> 00:51:25.359
What is it?

00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:27.881
Okay.

00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:31.994
Submit a request for Oh Jong Tae's arrest warrant then.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.110
[Incheon West Police Station]

00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:36.992
Did you get a call from the prosecution?

00:51:36.992 --> 00:51:38.788
Not yet, sir.

00:51:38.788 --> 00:51:40.896
What if they dismiss it again?

00:51:40.896 --> 00:51:42.307
Don't worry.

00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:44.969
I'll go cause a scene at their office.

00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:50.983
Hey, they won't even bat an eye at a sergeant.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.561
I'll go.

00:51:53.561 --> 00:51:56.297
They' should definitely notice a chief.

00:51:56.297 --> 00:51:57.597
Really?

00:51:57.597 --> 00:52:00.721
You can do that?

00:52:00.721 --> 00:52:03.707
What happened with the body from Gawol Church?

00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:04.675
You see...

00:52:04.699 --> 00:52:08.732
We'll have the suspect once we confirm the victim's identity.

00:52:08.732 --> 00:52:09.830
Who is the suspect?

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.394
You see, sir.

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:15.538
It's Yoo Jeong Seok, the senior manager of Jeonghan Daily News.

00:52:15.538 --> 00:52:19.182
The younger brother of the Minister of Justice?

00:52:19.182 --> 00:52:20.886
Correct.

00:52:20.886 --> 00:52:22.779
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

00:52:22.779 --> 00:52:25.176
We got it while investigating Detective Jang's murder.

00:52:25.176 --> 00:52:26.859
What's wrong with you?

00:52:26.859 --> 00:52:29.562
Are you chasing after people like him on purpose?

00:52:29.562 --> 00:52:33.927
Hey! Our station is for catching small fishes.

00:52:33.927 --> 00:52:36.551
Why do you keep trying to catch whales?

00:52:36.551 --> 00:52:39.428
How do you feel about handing the case over to headquarters?

00:52:39.428 --> 00:52:41.560
- We have no choice.
- Right.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.334
We need to catch the whale if it's caught in our net.

00:52:45.334 --> 00:52:51.932
But the net might rip, or our ship may sink.

00:52:51.932 --> 00:52:53.641
Keep that in mind.

00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:58.236
You're so good at steering the ship, so that won't happen.

00:52:58.236 --> 00:53:00.755
Listen to you.

00:53:04.637 --> 00:53:07.570
We got an arrest warrant for Oh Jong Tae.

00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:16.158
- Hello!
- Hi.

00:53:16.158 --> 00:53:18.558
- Hi.
- What brings you here?

00:53:18.558 --> 00:53:20.730
- Is the chief in his office?
- Yes.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.843
Why do you need to see him?

00:53:21.843 --> 00:53:25.430
I need to talk to him about something. Don't mind me.

00:53:30.712 --> 00:53:33.517
Where are you right now?

00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:36.560
I've submitted it to my superiors,

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.445
so the auditing department will announce disciplinary action for you to the headquarters.

00:53:41.445 --> 00:53:46.336
I thought you promised to let go of my son's case last time.

00:53:46.336 --> 00:53:51.240
I was just saying I won't make it part of the deal.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.390
Do you have to make a big deal out of this for your office to be satisfied?

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:59.130
You should walk out on your own before you get fired.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.991
Then I'll just end it as a release from your duties.

00:54:03.618 --> 00:54:05.451
Are you really...

00:54:09.483 --> 00:54:13.513
- Chief Moon really accepted the charges?
- Yes.

00:54:13.513 --> 00:54:16.736
He said he'll accept the dismissal as well.

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:21.789
Why did he accept them so easily?

00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:25.779
He did put in a condition that I'll end it with just him.

00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:28.458
He doesn't want me to harass his men anymore.

00:54:28.458 --> 00:54:30.605
He's trying to look out for them?

00:54:30.605 --> 00:54:34.310
But I'm sure his men will realize something too.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:36.743
They'll know that the chief is getting fired because of them.

00:54:36.743 --> 00:54:40.701
But Kang Do Chang won't be able to do as he pleases now, right?

00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:45.500
Of course not, if he's a smart man.

00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:05.703
Hello, this is Yoon Sang Mi from the auditing department.

00:55:05.703 --> 00:55:08.025
I'd like to meet with you.

00:55:09.467 --> 00:55:12.939
Oh, I'll come to you then.

00:55:12.939 --> 00:55:15.510
I said no one is in the office!

00:55:18.636 --> 00:55:19.851
When did he leave?

00:55:19.851 --> 00:55:21.626
He just left.

00:55:21.626 --> 00:55:23.249
What?

00:55:23.249 --> 00:55:25.236
He knew we were coming?

00:55:25.236 --> 00:55:28.242
- He didn't say where he was going?
- No.

00:55:33.986 --> 00:55:35.427
He won't answer. His phone is off.

00:55:35.427 --> 00:55:37.209
So he caught on to us.

00:55:37.209 --> 00:55:40.100
What if he drops off the grid?

00:55:41.515 --> 00:55:43.345
Hey, we lost Oh Jong Tae!

00:55:43.345 --> 00:55:46.862
Okay. Get his credit card history right away,

00:55:46.862 --> 00:55:49.023
and look for him at places he frequents.

00:55:49.023 --> 00:55:51.647
Submit a request to track his phone.

00:55:51.647 --> 00:55:53.455
The two of us will go to his home.

00:55:53.455 --> 00:55:55.564
He might not know about the arrest warrant yet.

00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:56.864
Okay.

00:56:05.464 --> 00:56:08.257
What evidence do they have?

00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:10.693
They got it from your car before it was scrapped.

00:56:10.693 --> 00:56:12.922
It will prove that you killed Yoon Ji Seon.

00:56:12.922 --> 00:56:16.214
But Yoon Ji Seon's case can't be brought to court again.

00:56:16.214 --> 00:56:18.487
The fact that the judge issued an arrest warrant means

00:56:18.487 --> 00:56:22.783
that he has accepted it as proof for conspiring to kill Park Geon Ho.

00:56:22.783 --> 00:56:27.666
So I need to run away from those damn detectives?

00:56:27.666 --> 00:56:28.797
That's humiliating.

00:56:28.797 --> 00:56:32.776
Did you see today's issue of Jeonghan Daily?

00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.191
No, not yet.

00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:48.585
You must've come here often. It's your uncle's home.

00:56:48.585 --> 00:56:50.742
I lived here for a long time.

00:56:50.742 --> 00:56:54.307
I spent my childhood here with Jong Tae.

00:56:54.307 --> 00:56:57.822
- Why?
- My parents passed away when I was little.

00:56:58.531 --> 00:57:01.030
My father was killed.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:05.321
And my mother had depression and took her own life.

00:57:06.663 --> 00:57:12.173
The victim's family blames themselves if the killer doesn't get caught.

00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:17.564
If I hadn't called my dad asking him to come home early...

00:57:18.317 --> 00:57:21.917
If I had screamed when the killer appeared,

00:57:22.733 --> 00:57:25.000
then my dad wouldn't have died.

00:57:26.168 --> 00:57:28.912
If I had recognized the man who killed my dad,

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:31.312
my mom wouldn't have died either.

00:57:32.213 --> 00:57:35.282
We need to find out who made Lee Dae Cheol die.

00:57:35.282 --> 00:57:40.258
Then Eun Hye will stop blaming herself for her dad's death.

00:57:41.515 --> 00:57:42.615
Right.

00:57:42.615 --> 00:57:45.265
I didn't think about that.

00:57:45.265 --> 00:57:49.019
That's how we can really help Eun Hye.

00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:52.040
You should've told me your story a long time ago!

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:55.807
I thought you were just a psycho until now.

00:57:55.807 --> 00:57:58.469
Did your opinion of me change now?

00:57:58.469 --> 00:57:59.993
Yeah.

00:57:59.993 --> 00:58:02.075
You're not a total psychopath.

00:58:02.075 --> 00:58:04.565
