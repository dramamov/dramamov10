Who exactly are you implying said that?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.520
Don't you remember?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.770
Me?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.690
I did?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.670
You at least remember being on the phone with Gi Dong Jae

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.720
after having a conversation with Ms. Jeong Hui Joo in your office, right?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.770
There was a call in Gi Dong Jae's phone records

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.130
that matches up with the record of the burner phone you used to have.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.300
At that time, you and Gi Dong Jae talked on the phone.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.830
The world is so scary, don't you think?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.080
When a bunch of people attack at the same time like this,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.110
it's so easy to make someone into a criminal.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.880
Right?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.790
But I'm curious.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.970
Why, at this moment, did you reveal such an important card to me?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.560
When detectives show this much evidence, people usually confess.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.550
If the culprit

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.530
has even a tiny bit of guilt left.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.240
Do I really seem like such a pushover?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.320
Do I?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.290
Just because I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.240
obediently answered each and every one of your questions,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.380
do I really look like those dogshit gangsters that you deal with?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.690
It's no different than those dogshit gangsters... the things you do.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.600
Please understand, Chairman.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.300
He really can't stand a young person being so rude.

Why do I have to be embarrassed by those kinds of people?

I'm sorry.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.620
I really didn't predict that they would go this far.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.050
"Didn't predict," my ass.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.780
Those detectives.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.100
I think they worked me up on purpose.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.420
They're hiding something. Find out what that is.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.840
Yes, sir.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.370
- Close it.
- Yes.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.130
I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations, so kill that bitch!

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.370
"I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations,

so kill that bitch!"

That bastard heard it.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.780
- Yes, Chairman?
- Call the company security team, and tell them to gather at my office.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.710
You hate the sight of us, right?

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.140
Because you wouldn't be here if it weren't for us, right?

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.300
When you're sent to the prosecutor's office tomorrow, tell them

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.750
not to believe anything those freaks at violent crimes say.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.000
And that what Chairman Cheon Sang Woo said today is correct.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.310
The prosecutor would really like that. He's quite keen when it comes to the art of making a living.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.450
If you keep denying your relation to Cheon Sang Woo,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.030
we'll have to stop investigating him.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.560
We're all you have right now.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.970
Yes.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.380
If that gets presented as evidence at the trial...

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.390
Well then, I would have no choice but to admit to some things, right?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.000
You're going to keep your mouth shut until then?

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.670
You probably know since you work as a detective, but no matter how much evidence you find and shove in,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.200
if the prosecutor doesn't accept it as evidence, it's of no use.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.030
Do you think a keen prosecutor, when it comes to the art of making a living, would accept that as evidence?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.760
You know what the prosecutors always say.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.070
This is not admissible evidence.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.520

The time was too short.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.950
You removed the hidden camera equipment, right?

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.330
It's a shame. It was a perfect way to kill time when I was bored.

How was it? Meeting my brother in person. Was he okay to deal with?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.820
He was ruder than I thought.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.690
That's a good attitude. You just need to deal with him without prejudice.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.400
Why don't you hand the video over to me?

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.380
It won't be admissible evidence anyway. We'll be careful not to publicize it.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.810
But we need to get the prosecutor on our side.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.850
He has to see it with his own eyes to make him come to our side.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.450
Which video are you talking about?

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.800
We don't have time. The odds won't be on our side if we don't finish this quickly.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.020

You even worked as a Seoul MIU team leader before you retired.

Yes.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.920
Well then, I don't need to explain. Take a look yourself.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.840
If there's anything missing, please let me know,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.300
and from my point of view, the evidence that's needed for the trial

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.170
seems to be ready without anything missing.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.050
Not having the interrogation report of Gi Dong Jae, who actually committed the murder, is a bit of a flaw,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.680
but we can't quite drag over a dead person and interrogate him.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.160
So this is the best option we have.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.780
Yes. Well,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.080
I think you can hold the trial with that.

Yes.

You're admitting to ordering the murder of Jeong Hui Joo?

have you, by any chance, met with the lawyers from TJ?

You've probably received phone calls from many different places.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.820
And there probably was a lot of talk about your future too.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.320
I think

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.230
what kind of agreement you and I will reach in this trial

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.190
is the most important thing.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.810
Agreement? What kind of agreement?

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.840
Tail-cutting.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.500
I'm okay with that happening.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.380
However, don't lock that tail in prison for too long.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.580
If we can agree on a duration,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.900
I'll keep my mouth shut about the body for a while.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.080
Wow, you must've done many under-the-table deals when you were a detective.

You're a master at it.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.610
Well, I'll take out little things that won't be noticed, and...

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.310
I understand. I'll take care of everything in a way

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.720
that doesn't embarrass me as a prosecutor.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.120
You're the only related family member of the deceased Jeong Hui Joo, right?

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.140
Yes.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.520

No, no.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.630
I didn't raise her.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.510
She raised me.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.680
She made me breathe, and made me eat.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.230
Aigoo. Because the case was overturned in the middle,

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.280
you must have had a very hard time, mustn't you?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.900
Yes.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.000
But I think we're finally at the end of it.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.040
I'm really grateful to everyone who's been working so hard on this.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.480
The murderer of your granddaughter was revealed. It was Gi Dong Jae.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.690
He's currently missing.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.700
We're assuming he was murdered.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.160
So think of it as punishment for his sins. It'll help you rest easy.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.790
Okay.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.910
But there's another culprit who called for the murder.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.930
Choi Yong Geun.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.380
The fact that he instructed Gi Dong Jae has been revealed.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.550
Yes, I'm aware.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.330
Well, Choi Yong Geun will be sent to court to be judged by the law.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.050
Try to think that her grievances for having died unfairly have been resolved a bit.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.810
And you, who have been frustrated until now, can rest easy.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.420
Yes, Prosecutor.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.520
Thank you.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.400

we will send Gi Dong Jae and Choi Yong Geun to trial as the culprits of this case.

Well.

Detective Kang Do Chang also

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.190
agrees with you, right?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.100
Yes, well, I'm sure.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.640
Well then, you must be right.

You must really trust Detective Kang Do Chang.

Yes.

Who would listen to an old man like me?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.310
Everyone ignored me.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.490
However, Detective Kang

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.720
listened closely to me.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.020
And he found time in his busy schedule

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.910
to console and comfort me.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.400
If Detective Kang believes you,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.660
then I'll also have to believe you and follow your lead.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.000
Ah, I see.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.030
I heard that the grand TJ Group Chairman Cheon Sang Woo has descended into our station.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.140
You should've reported such an important occurrence immediately.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.280
- Yes, well, we were about to─
- How did you know?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.960
- We've thoroughly controlled things so that even the press doesn't know.
- Over yonder,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.840
if a police officer from the West Coast islands urinates into the sea,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.390
the very next day, the Seoul police agency has a meeting,

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.010
just because a police officer from an offshore island committed a misdemeanor.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.890
That's how it is in this business.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.900
Then do they know too?

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.610
They probably do. Of course.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.230
Chief,

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.080
the higher-ups will constantly call and pressure you.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.810
It's obvious. They don't want us to investigate Cheon Sang Woo.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.300
Don't you think it's best to avoid them for now?

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.600
Yes, that was a good choice.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.860
It was a call advertising cash loans.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.000
Aren't these jerks something?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.200
They know that I'll be discharged from my position as chief

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.600
and called to secure a customer.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.360
As if they were supernatural.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.630
Honestly, I wish it was the higher-ups calling me.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.140
But I'm only getting these kinds of calls all day long.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.650
Do you know why?

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.800
I went to a reunion with some past police colleagues yesterday.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.290
But those guys were treating me like I was invisible.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.780
Even though my glass was empty, there wasn't a single person pouring me a drink.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.790
Fifteen of us were gathered,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.650
and I was the only one drinking alone.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.920
Do you know why?

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.110
Yes, come on in.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.910
Chief, the main agency called.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.080
Your patrol this week has been postponed indefinitely.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.320
Okay, thank you.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.300
Hey, Kwon Jae Hong, as the one who catches the drift first and as the fastest person here,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.770
why don't you clearly summarize my situation?

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.400
You're an outcast.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.810
The special characteristics of an outcast.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.430
Even if you get beaten up somewhere and get your head smashed in,

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.770
no one cares.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.240
The organization, known as law enforcement that you all believed in so much,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.620
seems to have abandoned you

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.870
and me as well.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.750
We have to be able to see the stars if we want to grab them.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.490
It feels like everything is dark.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.720
"Young policemen!"

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.470
Sit down.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.500
"The country...!"

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.330
Hello?

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.740
Ah, yes, yes?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.900
Yes, I understand. I'll come right away.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.280
Yes, yes.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.500
Hey. I just got a phone call from the accountant,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.560
and they said that they found suspicious funds in Gi Dong Jae's company. Let's go there.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.920
I told you that we'd get something if we looked into that.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.870
Good job.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.620
We're going to go to the accountant's office and check the data there,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.790
so Ji Woong and Man Goo, you two go to Gi Dong Jae's meat processing company and confiscate all the documents.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.820
Okay? We're going.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.360
We don't even have a warrant.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.620
What are you expecting? The police organization abandoned us.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.790
Then the best thing to do is just push through without thinking. See you.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.300
Well, they are gangsters, so who cares about warrants.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.250
By the way, don't you think we might fall in love with them?

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.600
- We talk to them so often with our bodies.
- Yes?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.670
Excuse me?

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.820
I see, okay.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.300
Hey, Prosecutor Cha wants to see us. Let's go.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.740
Why?

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.710
- He says he wants to have some drinks.
- All of a sudden?

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.240
He wants to meet us with no pretenses about ranks.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.290
Don't you feel like things will turn out well? Let's go.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.050
Okay, then.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.830
Oh?

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.260
I can see it.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.500
A star. It's a bit faint,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.040
but wait, right there.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.090
Ahjumma. Ahjumma, Ahjumma!

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.610
Grandpa asked for some chicken to eat later.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.540
He said he's going to have a drink with some friends.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.900
Really? How unexpected!

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.980
He already ate all the chicken we brought him too.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.240
Wow, that's great!

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.460
He must finally be getting his appetite back.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.130
Okay, I should fry it quickly.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.310
He's so energized.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.940
I'm so happy, too!

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.560
Why all of a sudden? What happened?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.850
Today he met with the prosecutor,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.060
and he said he's going to get all the people who killed Hui Joo.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.140
That's good! That prosecutor must be a good man.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.480
Yeah! He said he's such a good man!

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.850
Isn't it great?

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.170
Aigoo.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.400
- Why are you here so early?
- Hello, Prosecutor.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.540
Hello. Sit down.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.800
You're okay with somaek (beer-soju mix), right?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.730
- Yes, I'll do it for you.
- No.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.040
I'm good at it.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.490
Making somaek is the only thing I got better at while working as a prosecutor.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.870
Did you order some chicken?

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.900
No, not yet.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.900
Eun Hui, an order of serrano-mayo boneless,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.920
and I don't know what sauce he'd like,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.570
so sweet and spicy, gochu-mayo, gochu-hot sauce, bring them all.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.100
Okay.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.390
You must be a regular here. You have the menu memorized.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.760
My sister runs this store.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.550
No wonder.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.480
It's a store run by your family, I see.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.890
That part-time worker is...?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.580
That's not a part-time worker.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.300
She's my daughter.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.940
The beer is a bit low.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.100
I'll bring it over. Are two bottles enough?

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.930
And there's something special I eat only when I eat ramen,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.930
I'll bring some of that too.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.460
That girl called the owner ahjumma earlier.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.200
If she's the daughter, shouldn't she call her "aunt" instead?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.610
She's not his biological daughter.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.750
She's someone that Hyeongnim raised like his own.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.930
Why?

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.970
Why would an unmarried detective do that?

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.570
Well, it's...

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.980
Could it be that she's the bereaved daughter of a victim?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.000
I'm asking if he's raising her out of some useless sympathy.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.140
Yes, that's right.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.400
He thinks that her father died because of him.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.430
Is she the daughter of the executed Lee Dae Cheol?

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.400
This is driving me nuts.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.900
Eun Hye.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.370
Why are you going on a delivery?

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.440
It's not a delivery. I'm going to Grandpa.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.770
Yeah? Okay. Take care.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.160
Say hi to Grandpa for me.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.820
Okay. I'll be back.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.950
Here.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.260
Since I was going,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.490
I got another bottle of soju too.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.590
I saw the ratio of your somaek,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.480
and thought the soju will be empty soon too.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.860
And this here,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.020
is brown mustard leaf kimchi, something I only eat when I eat ramen.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.540
The biting taste also has some carbonated texture to it.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.070
Carbonated...

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.980
This is really killing me.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.960
I mean, you said you would do somaek.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.260
It's a basic rule that a detective should have some space with the victim's family,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.480
because only then you can investigate objectively. Am I wrong?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.190
N-No. You're right.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.850
Then why? Why did you give personal consideration

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.930
to Ms. Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather?

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.610
Why do you give free chicken to that old man?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.030
The victim's family gets a bias toward the detectives!

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.300
Right? How would you fairly investigate?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.330
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.170
And since a detective's salary isn't much,

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.060
why would you take care of a victim's daughter?

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.220
You're a person whose wedding was canceled

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.070
because you were catching a culprit that day. Useless.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.660
A detective should just focus on being a police pig. Why are you making waves? Why?

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.080
Damn.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.320
Damn?

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.300
- You're saying damn at a prosecutor?
- Please understand.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.180
He extremely hates it when young people act rudely.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.270
What?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.520
Hey! Do you think I live like this because I want to?

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.010
I was a bully too.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.030
A bully who lived beating up innocent people.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.440
But what am I supposed to do? I became like this over time!

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.580
I don't want to live like this, either!

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.070
Then it's not too late yet!

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.110
So just live like me.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.300
Okay?

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.010
I'm telling you to get on the rich people's side.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.650
Just make a decision and change.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.140
Buy a house in Gangnam, and send your kid to study abroad,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.710
and get an attractive girlfriend too!

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.060
Why are you...

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.230
roping my innocent life into your pathetic life too? Why?

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.010
You have nothing to show for yourself.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.440
Prosecutor,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.720
what was the reason you wanted to see us today?

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.190
I don't know. I forgot because I got so angry.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.380
Okay, have a good night.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.280
Hey, what's wrong with that guy? Did I do something wrong?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.320
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.280
- Then why is he throwing a fit?
- Like you said,

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.090
I have a good feeling. It seems like things are getting better.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.860
What are you talking about? It's even worse now.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.010
Yeah?

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.370
Are the kids asleep?

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.370
Yeah, yeah. I'm done drinking.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.310
I'll be back soon.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.820
Okay.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.150
Do you want a cup of coffee?

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.070
Okay. Why not.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.550
Your face looks lively.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.930
Do you have a new boyfriend?

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.970
Crazy bastard.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.040
What do you think will happen to arrested Team Leader Choi Yong Geun?

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.710
It's a bit of a headache.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.680
Speaking of that, you should help and get him out.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.120
I don't have any power.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.760
Are you okay?

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.320
The press seemed to want to make the case bigger.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.820
There's no way it'll reach me.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.170
as long as you don't do anything.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.820
By the way, it's a shame for you.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.320
If only Woo Tae Ho were alive in this situation,

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.970
it would've become yours and Tae Ho's world.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.710
Right?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.450
You were really scared of Tae Ho, weren't you?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.680
That was your intention.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.600
What was the reason you brought Tae Ho in?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.930
You wanted to scare me, am I wrong?

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.400
Okay, sure, sure, this much.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.010
I...

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.340
really thought that you wouldn't love Tae.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.570
That you wouldn't love Tae Ho.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.690
Since he was just a tool for your goals.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.360
Why did you?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.140
You didn't feel any love. Why did you get feelings of jealousy?

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.230
You said you knew me well.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.180
Do you think those kinds of feelings exist in me?

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.420
So, you didn't have them?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.340
Then, feelings you didn't have suddenly appeared?

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.210
Watching him messing around with another woman

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.500
made you explode inside, didn't it?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.530
That makes sense.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.570
Why am I not as sly as Tae Ho?

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.640
You know,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.370
if someone stabs me,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.900
I stab too.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.900
Stupid guy.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.500
Thank you for the drink.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.680
Na Na,

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.770
you killed Woo Tae Ho, didn't you?

[What are you saying right now?]

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.690
Yes?

Hello.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.090
Hello, Prosecutor.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.680
Hey, come on in. Sit.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.770
I have already taken a look at what Detective Oh sent me this morning.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.050
I see.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.710
You have good memory.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.070
How did you memorize all from watching it just once?

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.840
This guy said he messed up on everything when he took the police academy exam,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.610
but on the memorization subject, full points!

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.700
He got into the police academy with his memorization skills.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.930
Your memory is killer.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.310
They don't have that many subjects that need memorization.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.040
Oh, really?

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.900
There's no other reason.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.490
It's because I'm a detective.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.020
Any detective would have gotten it ingrained in their head

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.820
if they saw a video like that.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.020
That's right. I would've been the same too.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.550
You're right. Because we're detectives.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.210
You don't have the recorded video, right?

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.650
No. It's an illegally filmed video, so I think it'll be difficult to acquire.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.600
Let's arrest Cheon Sang Woo,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.130
for the charge of hiring a hitman.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.250
- Excuse me?
- It fits perfectly with the motive that was submitted earlier.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.540
And the fact that he was on the phone with Gi Dong Jae has already been proven.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.070
And in the material you've sent me earlier,

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.450
the fact that there was a price can be proven.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.490
I think we can get an arrest warrant.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.080
If it were just a regular person, it would be possible, but he's a conglomerate's chairman.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.390
And you said the moment we request a warrant,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.610
there will be some other prosecutor in your position.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.910
I...

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.820
have two sons.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.230
And they don't really know how much of an awesome prosecutor I am.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.610
Using this as an opportunity,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.930
I'll show them how great I am!

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.600
Is it true that you requested an arrest warrant for Chairman Cheon Sang Woo?

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.740
Yes. That's true.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.430
Is he charged with soliciting a murder?

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.780
Yes, he is.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.840
Some opinions say this is just a setup for later scapegoating. Is that true?

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.460
- No.
- Has the warrant been approved?

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.600
I believe it's still under review.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.170
Was it your own decision to request the warrant,

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.880
or was it the entire prosecution organization's decision?

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.270
Requests for arrest warrants are the personal decision of prosecutors.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.910
If the entire prosecution's opinion is different from yours,

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.690
isn't there a possibility that they'll replace you as the prosecutor?

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.900
The prosecution

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.690
isn't an organization that is easily shaken by outside pressure.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.140
It's not an organization that would be

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.850
swept away in a situation like that.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.960
Are you saying that there was no outside interference or pressure at all?

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.420
You seem to have some prejudice, so I'll explain things clearly, here and now.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.740
There is no external pressure in this investigation.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.210
Who would do such obvious things like

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.370
excluding the investigator from investigations,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.880
and replacing the prosecutor

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.560
for not listening to the higher-ups?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.550
That's all for now.

Not bad.

The police say they've secured evidence. What kind of evidence is it?

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.090
You denied the allegations at the police interrogation. Do you still think the same?

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.570

afraid.

doesn't get answered before I'm dead?

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.060
You have to live until it's resolved.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.360
I'm too tired.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.000
I also wonder if I'm holding on for no reason.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.520
None of it would matter if I died.

The moment my father passed away,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.250
he smiled at me.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.180
If I meet my father again, I'll smile at him too.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.540
If you meet Hui Joo, you should smile too.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.730
"All the unfairness has been proven,

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.250
Okay. I should smile.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.660
When I see her again, I should smile.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.360
I lived smiling because I was looking at her.

Teaching an old man like me why I need to live.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:11.670
Thank you for that, Eun Hye.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.520
Was it you, the defendant,

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.640
who commissioned Gi Dong Jae to commit murder?

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.270
The defendant sent the serial murder victim's photos to Gi Dong Jae, right?

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.270
And at the time Ms. Jeong's corpse was being dumped, you gave advice over the phone.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.240
You admit to that, right?

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.140
Yes.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.960
Then, doesn't that mean you admit to the charges of ordering the murder?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.830
Perhaps, "there's a separate person who ordered the murder."

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.550
Are you claiming that the defendant only instructed the body dumping?

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.700
If that claim is true,

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.580
does the defendant know the person

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:58.680
who solicited Gi Dong Jae for the murder?

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.460
Gi Dong Jae didn't say anything about that to me. He just

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.560
said that he accidentally killed a person, I think.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.830
"No other person ordered the murder.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.780
Gi Dong Jae was acting by himself."

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.380
Yes. That's how I understand it.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.030
When the defendant was on the phone with Gi Dong Jae,

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.890
"What about Jeong Hui Joo's body?"

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:23.710
he asked, specifically using the name of the victim.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.960
Jeong Hui Joo

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.430
was an employee who worked in the defendant's department.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.440
She worked in the same company and was murdered,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.340
but without asking about the motive for murder,

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.140
you just believed that Gi Dong Jae killed her accidentally, and let it go.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.110
Yes. I just thought of it as a coincidence

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.710
and let it slide.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.570
After Gi Dong Jae murdered Jeong Hui Joo,

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.350
a subcontract fee of two billion won ($1.5 million)

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.980
was paid to the company that Gi Dong Jae owned.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:55.210
However, there is no evidence of any product in return being sent to TJ. This two billion won

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.730
was seemingly the price for the hitman.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.860
Defendant,

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.350
if Gi Dong Jae asked for your advice,

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:11.380
shouldn't he be the one paying you?

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.910
I was part of the legal team.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.720
That kind of business has nothing to do with me.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.880
It has nothing to do with you?

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.570
Then, you're saying that someone

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.970
who was your superior made the decision and paid for it.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.240
You're saying someone higher than you

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.110
handed over the money to Gi Dong Jae. Is that true?

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.690
Your Honor,

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.000
the prosecution is currently forcing testimony

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.460
with the assumption that the contract killing is a fact.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.230
That is nothing more than an assumption.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.360
As things stand, the claim that the killing was contracted,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.070
rather than the claim that the murder was accidental, makes more sense.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.590
Prosecution, continue.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.620
If you, defendant,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.830
keep denying the existence of another person who ordered the murder,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.230
you would become the only suspect

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.740
who ordered Jeong Hui Joo's murder.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.270
No further questions.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.400
Defendant Choi Yong Geun, can we assume that you have no complaints

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.940
against the prosecution's claims?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.130
Your Honor,

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.530
I am not the one who arranged the murder.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.160
Then say it!

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.380
- That there's another person!
- I want to know too.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.330
Because only then will my allegations be cleared.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.180
In that case,

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.800
is the defendant admitting

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.150
that this case is a contracted murder?

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.470
Yes, I believe so.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.920
Has the witness on the stand

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.350
seen either of the two defendants before?

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.290
Yes, I have.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.200
Who?

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.420
That person.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.760
You said you saw him before Jeong Hui Joo, your granddaughter, was murdered.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.780
In what context did you see him?

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.590
He came to my store.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.610
At first, I thought he was a customer who came to buy shoes.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.250
However,

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.880
he acted like he didn't know my Hui Joo, even though he knew her.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.910
What did he talk about?

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.890
He said that she's too beautiful

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.660
and that she has to be careful of men.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.430
You said you saw him again after that, right?

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.290
At the corporation headquarters of TJ.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.720
At that time, what did the defendant say to you?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.630
He said that my Hui Joo

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.780
was a worm that sticks to rich married men

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.210
and takes money from them.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.800
He said that the Heavens punished her.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.880
Defendant Cheon Sang Woo, in the earlier defendant testimony,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.490
said that he barely knew the face of Ms. Jeong,

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.320
and that he hardly remembered her being an employee in the legal department.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.190
No further questions.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.720
Defense, you may now question the witness.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.990
No further questions.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.110
Didn't we gain at least a little advantage over them?

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.450
We didn't.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.520
They're acting like they're disadvantaged.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.540
The lawyers there, are the country's finest.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.640
They're not showing us their cards, and they're not giving us time to prepare.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.940
When they get to the retrials, they'll reveal their entire hand at once and push hard.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.840
So we'll need to prepare even more thoroughly.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.040
Right, Ms. Kim Min Ji. Do you think we can get her as a witness?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.230
- Well, we have the recording. Can't we play that at the trial?
- No.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.290
She has to come in person and explain the situation at the time.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.990
Only then would it be admissible evidence.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:13.650
She's a crucial witness who could prove Cheon Sang Woo's murder motive.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.070
We must bring her to court.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.380
Would Kim Min Ji come?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.370
I'll try contacting her. However, we shouldn't expect too much from it.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:29.630
As you said, there was a reason for pushing you hard during the interrogation.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.580
We've confirmed that Choi Yong Geun, who was in jail at the time,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.470
was released for investigation purposes.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:40.830
They made him watch your testimony in person.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.540
That's why he showed an uncertain attitude at the trial.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.320
He's going to try to stay neutral.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.850
We should get rid of the belief that Choi Yong Geun is on our side.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:00.630
Moving forward, we need to make things more advantageous for us.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.480
Doing so would make Choi Yong Geun return to us too.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.930
What's the opinion among the defense team?

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.990
There are still many variables, so the final course of action hasn't been decided yet.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.570
The most important variable,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.260
is whether Kim Min Ji attends the trial.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.770
You must stop that from happening.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.200
Hey.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.010
Why didn't you answer my phone call?

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.870
- Why?
- Oh, Daddy!

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.690
Soo Yeon?

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.180
Daddy!

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.800
Now,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.760
I have no reason to answer your phone call anymore.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.500
How did you? She...

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.440
Cheon Na Na?

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.240
You.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.330
I only brought her because auntie wanted to see her niece.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.220
She takes after her father a lot.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.660
It turned out well today. I like it.

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.970
Witness Kim Min Ji seems to have been won over by the prosecution.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.910
Yes, I know it's an unfavorable situation.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:43.040
We need a critical card to turn this around, so let's get going.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.770
How did it go? Did they come up with something?

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.920
Yes.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.230
How?

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.900
Everyone's opinion points towards one thing,

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.570
Woo Tae Ho.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.240
Woo Tae Ho?

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.400
Did he say that's why he killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.470
I thought he would just threaten her.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.310
When I heard that Hui Joo was a victim of a serial killer,

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.850
I thoughi, "Ah, Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo didn't kill her."

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:28.490
"Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo wouldn't have sent a serial killer to kill her."

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.900
But...

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.080
that serial killer

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.640
said he didn't kill her, so...

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.060
This conversation

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.710
becomes an important piece of evidence revealing the defendant's murder motive.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.010
Are you certain that the recorded voice

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.480
- is your own voice?
- Yes.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.700
And the content of the conversation is true as well?

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.690
Yes.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.440
No further questions.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.900
The defense may now cross-examine.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.600
Please play the last part of the recording one more time.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.160
Hui Joo said she couldn't trust you either.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.560
Because she learned that you

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.750
eagerly covered up the assault case from two years ago.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.130
She thought that you were on the same team as

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.170
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.160
Yes, that's enough.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.520
This is also your own voice, right?

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.580
Yes.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.150
Were you aware that this conversation was being recorded?

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.780
- No.
- No further questions.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.840
Was it you, the defendant, who made an employee take this photo,

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.690
and then instructed them to send it to Jeong Hui Joo?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.430
Yes.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.710
What was the reason?

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.680
I...

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.390
knew that Woo Tae Ho was hiding the CCTV footage from the assault case.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.570
Using the fact that I knew Woo Tae Ho and she were having an affair,

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.120
I told Jeong Hui Joo to find the hidden evidence and bring it to me.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:21.720
The defendant was the team leader of Seoul MIU

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.960
who was responsible for that assault case from two years ago.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.920
As we heard from the recording, Woo Tae Ho asked for your help to cover up that case, right?

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.420
And due to that relationship, Woo Tae Ho brought you in as the legal team leader, right?

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.480
- Yes.
- So then, rather than defendant Cheon Sang Woo,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:45.560
you would've been closer with team leader Woo Tae Ho, since you knew each other's weaknesses, right?

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.120
Yes, that's right.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.290
Woo Tae Ho knew the murderer Gi Dong Jae too, correct?

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.930
Gi Dong Jae owned a subcontractor business that worked under TJ.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:00.170
However, the legal department lead probably didn't have enough power to decide on the companies to be subcontracted.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.490
Wasn't this only possible

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.380
with the permission of a director-level employee, such as Team Leader Woo Tae Ho?

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.290
Well, yes, I guess.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:16.250
Woo Tae Ho is a person who rose to a director-level position from a simple prosecutor.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.530
It was possible because he was the son-in-law of a chaebol family.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.340
If the fact that he had an affair with Jeong Hui Joo was revealed,

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.700
he would have met an irreversible crisis.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.750
So he asked Gi Dong Jae,

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.140
"Make Jeong Hui Joo into a victim of a serial murder."

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.410
"Only then will I be able to avoid becoming a suspect."

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.270
Objection, Your Honor!

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.060
Woo Tae Ho is already dead.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.600
By using a story that can't be proven, they're confusing the trial with something irrelevant to this case.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.550
Defendant Cheon Sang Woo.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.670
Yes?

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.990
If the defense's claim is proven to be true,

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:55.600
you may face a separate trial for murder.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.270
Do you accept the defense's claims?

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.240
Yes, I do.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.760
Objection overruled.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.010
Defense, please continue.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.860
Contrary to Woo Tae Ho's intentions,

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.860
it was revealed that Jeong Hui Joo's murder was not the work of a serial killer,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:17.700
and after his wife, who found out about the affair, declared that she was divorcing him, he made a final move.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.190
And taking advantage of assault victim Kim Min Ji's ill feelings,

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:25.270
"make Cheon Sang Woo into a criminal who ordered a murder."

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.730
To use the conversation between him and Kim Min Ji as evidence, he intentionally recorded it.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:36.330
Let's listen to Woo Tae Ho's voice on the car dash cam recording right before Woo Tae Ho died.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.420
This is the best way.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.040
Please follow my lead this time.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:49.870
According to the report the police made, right before Woo Tae Ho died, he called the detective in charge,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:55.310
and said that he had something to testify related to the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.650
The reason why Woo Tae Ho said "the best way" in the recording

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.650
is because he thought he could kill two birds with one stone.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.360
Hide his crime by going to the police,

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.230
and making the defendant Cheon Sang Woo the mastermind. Also,

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.180
to change the mind of Cheon Na Na, who was competing for the CEO seat,

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.220
and make the news about his divorce

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.300
disappear.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.230
The defendant was aware of most of these facts.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.210
However why, in the investigation,

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.440
did he not testify about this?

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.960
Woo Tae Ho was my sister's husband

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.770
and he contributed a great deal to the TJ Group.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.010
I thought it was my last courtesy to the deceased Woo Tae Ho.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.750
No further questions.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.080
No. No, no.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.320
Woo Tae Ho

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.100
is not a person who would kill my Hui Joo.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.480
No, no.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.010
I heard

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.270
that there's a high possibility Chairman Cheon Sang Woo will be released.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.040
Do you think that will happen?

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.690
We need to wait and see.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.150
What about you?

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.490
Well, I'd probably be sentenced to a short stint.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:31.260
But Cheon Sang Woo, Cheon Na Na... neither of them can abandon me.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.270
They'll work hard behind the scenes. I'll rest in here and come out after a bit.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.100
That's a relief.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.900
Did you meet with Director Cheon Na Na?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.090
- Yes.
- What did she say?

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.350
To withdraw money from a borrowed-name account,

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.360
the consent of the people who lent the account is required.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.960
It's hard to convince all of them,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.850
but she said she talked to a few already.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:58.940
Did you tell her that it had to be resolved before the trial is over?

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.620
Yes. She said to make a bank account

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.760
and to give her the account number.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.800
Check the account and contact me as soon as the money comes in.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.060
If Chairman Cheon Sang Woo gets released,

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.110
wouldn't he try to take that money back?

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.700
Even if he comes out, he won't be able to take it back

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:22.410
because I still have a weapon called 'honesty.'

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.330
I heard the approximate amount from Director Cheon,

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.160
and it's more than I could imagine.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.480
She said that's just a part of it.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.470
If it's too big,

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.980
wouldn't there be a strong possibility for it to be exposed?

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.930
Gi Jin,

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.450
do you know what kind of money has the least trouble?

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.750
Money that thieves hide after stealing it.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.240
We just have to say the words.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.900
Open

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.850
sesame.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.370
Was there anything we could refute

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.520
from what the defense said?

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.790
Most of what they said was based on facts.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.510
But Woo Tae Ho ordering the murder is nonsense in the first place.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.700
They just roped him in.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.330
There's no way to prove it right now.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.760
The only way is to go to the afterlife and ask Woo Tae Ho and Jeong Hui Joo, like you said.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.180
I wonder what Woo Tae Ho meant when he said, "this is the best way."

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.980
Did you meet with Cheon Na Na? It was said to her,

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.580
so she might know what her husband meant.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.230
She said that he meant that he would reveal the assault case that Cheon Sang Woo committed two years ago.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.630
That won't help.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.590
I think it could mean confession.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:43.240
Are you saying that Woo Tae Ho could actually be the culprit like they're claiming?

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.800
I'm not saying their claim is correct.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.860
Hey, stop talking nonsense. You said you saw it.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.460
You said that in the video,

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.970
you saw with your own two eyes that Cheon Sang Woo was the one who ordered the murder.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:57.010
Why are you saying such things in front of the prosecutor?

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.610
You're confusing him.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.450
There's no other way.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.830
I'll bring that video to court.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.750
You said the owner has no intention of giving it to you.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:07.160
We have to try to get it somehow.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.440
It's a video that was illegally filmed without his consent.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.850
And if there's any chance for illegality, even in the evidence acquisition process,

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.500
the chance it will be admissible evidence is zero. Zero.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.610
Evidence that is inadmissible can't even be brought into court.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.950
If it's not admissible,

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.710
we can make it admissible.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.310
[1,000 won]
[30,001,000 won]

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.910
[160,001,000 won]

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.320
[350,001,000 won]

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.730
It's done.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:45.050
Open sesame.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.110
Don't you need kimchi?

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.270
They also sell kimchi at the convenience store?

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:57.040
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.900
Hurry up and bring kimchi.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.980
[HEAVEN]

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.400
Delicious.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:13.540
The video that you showed me. You said you didn't show it to Woo Tae Ho, right?

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.140
- Yes.
- It's okay even if I don't believe that, right?

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.500
Honestly, illegally filming is not that big of a crime.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.960
As long as it wasn't used for sexual reasons,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.830
it would just incur a fine.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.820
That won't change my mind.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.470
That's true.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:34.520
Because if the fact that you filmed it and handed it over to police was revealed,

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.120
you'd be the immoral person who made your brother into a man who arranged a murder.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.610
You'd then be abandoned by your family,

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:45.370
and get kicked out of your company, right?

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.260
And?

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:51.700
The defense team

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.370
randomly subpoenaed

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:57.400
the deceased Team Leader Woo Tae Ho.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.830
So, we're planning on doing something random like that too.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:02.510
We need your permission.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:03.740
From me?

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.520
What kind of permission?

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.040
Open the door for us.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.500
- What's your business?
- We have a search and seizure warrant for

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.180
a suspect in the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.030
Ji Woong, Man Goo, go over this way,

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.980
- Jae Hong and you go over there.
- Okay.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.020
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay.

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.550
My husband's office is on the second floor.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.290
Okay.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:56.940
Here, show us the video.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.520
Why are you torturing me so much? Why?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.300
What did I do to you to deserve this?

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.970
Huh?

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.170
Why?

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.770
Your Honor, turn this video off, right now!

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:11.550
Turn it off for now.

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:14.450
This video was illegally filmed. There's a problem with it being submitted as evidence.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.540
It is admissible evidence.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.300
I already checked it as well.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.820
On what basis?

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.960
Let me tell you about that.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.680
In the preceding trial, the defense

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.440
claimed that Team Leader Woo Tae Ho was the one who ordered the murder.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.950
As a prosecutor, I had to check the facts,

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.860
and to acquire that evidence,

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.880
we restarted the investigation on Woo Tae Ho.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.950
This video evidence,

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:39.760
was found at the office in Woo Tae Ho's house.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.010
It's evidence that was found as a result of search and seizure.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.060
It's assumed that Woo Tae Ho secretly filmed this.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:50.100
No. That wasn't filmed by Woo Tae Ho!

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.460
Then who filmed it?

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.180
In the last trial, the defense said

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.570
that Woo Tae Ho tried to make defendant Cheon Sang Woo the culprit.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:08.060
If that claim was valid, then, of course, this was filmed by Woo Tae Ho.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.680
The one who pointed fingers at Woo Tae Ho as the suspect,

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.970
is the defense.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.340
This is evidence that was found in that suspect's house.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:19.470
Do you still think this is not admissible as evidence?

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:24.040
Continue showing the video evidence.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:28.900
Kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.850
I'll give you enough to let your family be wealthy for generations,

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.740
so kill that bitch Jeong Hui Joo!

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.690
Department Lead Choi will take care of the rest,

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:43.560
so Gi Dong Jae, all you need to do is kill her!

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.180
Do you understand?

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.610
Next video.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.040
This is the reaction of Gi Dong Jae, who went missing after killing Jeong Hui Joo.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.980
Yes?

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.020
Jeong Hui Joo?

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.080
I mean, if you suddenly order such...

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.960
I understand, sir.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.560
I'll call back after discussing with Department Leader Choi.

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.320
Defendant Choi Yong Geun.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.790
- Yes.
- In the videos,

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.740
the person defendants Cheon Sang Woo and Gi Dong Jae

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.510
refer to as "Department Lead Choi" is you, correct?

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:24.030
Yes.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:28.130
Lastly, who is the person

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:31.880
who ordered Gi Dong Jae to murder Jeong Hui Joo?

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:54.950
It's Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.590
No further questions.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.790
Yes.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:17.580
Yes, it's good. I told you, the result was good.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:21.070
I'll tell you details when I get there.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:24.450
I said we would win. No matter what we would win.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.180
Yes, don't worry about it.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.270
I'll be in right away.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.990
Here he comes, here he comes!

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.500
Are you satisfied with how the trial ended?

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.190
What do you think of the evidence that was shown today at trial?

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:38.060
- Move back!
- All that's left is the verdict. How do you feel about that?

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.560
- Please move.
- Please say something.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.030
- Chairman Cheon!
- Please tell us how you feel.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.290
Hey, that guy.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:49.290
I'm worried he'll run away before the official verdict.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:50.520
I'm a bit nervous.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.480
I'll follow him and keep an eye out.

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.420
Go to the station first.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:54.810
What about me?

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.750
Taxi, taxi.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.440
[Cheon Sang Woo]

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.940
Na Na. Die.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.600
Die!

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:51.020
Hey!

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.070
You bitch!

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.340
You know you can't win against me.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.260
Just lose.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.250
You shouldn't get any more miserable.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.910
Just step back now. That's all you need to do.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.690
Why would I lose to you?

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.680
Why?

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.510
Die!

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:41.710
Whew. I almost killed

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:45.470
my only sister in front of a detective.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.990
Na Na, don't play tricks like this on me again.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.990
You can't win against me, even if I'm dead.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.460
You'll just die a pathetic death like your mother.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.280
Okay?

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.620
Are you okay?

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:20.360
Our relationship as siblings isn't very great, don't you think?

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.730
Yeah. It seems so.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.160
If you like, we'll have someone watch over you.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.270
It's nothing new.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:50.820
It's something I've been experiencing since I was young, so don't worry about it.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.740
The trial will turn out the way you wanted.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.710
However, it's not the end for me.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:58.300
Is there something left?

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.100
I want to know Woo Tae Ho's real thoughts before he died.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.160
Only when I know can I finally see the end.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.830
Nice, I was a bit sad we were finished.

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:13.400
Until that ending, let's keep seeing each other.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.370
Thank you for saving me today.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.340
Welcome.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.300
How are you feeling?

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.140
I'm better thanks to you.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.050
Take a seat.

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:03.460
I've raised my son wrong. I'm ashamed.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.750
You must be very concerned.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:09.650
The trial process was fair.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:12.120
I guess you have to accept it.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.070
I don't mean to make that an issue at this point.

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:21.640
It's about TJ, rather than my son.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:24.820
It's not because it's my company.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.280
If TJ collapses, the country's economy

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.870
will be affected more than we think.

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.110
McQueen's power would grow as well.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.850
We're also accepting that this is a serious issue.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:42.540
The reason why McQueen is trying to acquire TJ

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.170
is not because they're trying to save the dying TJ.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:50.880
They want to actually destroy it, and sell it, piece by piece.

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:56.510
Not so long ago, McQueen

01:03:56.510 --> 01:04:00.740
chose Woo Tae Ho as the CEO.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:06.260
It's a shame. It was the only chance to save TJ.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.420
I lost that opportunity foolishly.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.740
I am already aware.

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:19.310
I also thought that it was a great chance to change up the playing field.

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.290
I'll go out

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:24.920
and find another Woo Tae Ho.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.610
Can you promise that?

01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:39.480
So then, do you have someone in mind?

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.700
Yes. I do.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:45.280
This case

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.060
is an unprecedented case in which the head of one of

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:54.050
Korea's leading conglomerates appeared in court as a suspect who ordered a murder.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:59.720
All eyes are focused on this trial.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.190
The economic, catastrophic effect of imprisoning

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:07.990
the head of a conglomerate must also be taken into account.

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:10.560
However, this court

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.670
is going to talk about the only value

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.540
that we should never throw away.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:22.080
The law is equal for everyone.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.780
The sentencing.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:30.290
Defendant Choi Yong Geun, pleading guilty to the crime of instigating corpse abandonment,

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:33.170
is hereby sentenced to five years in prison.

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:39.980
Defendant Cheon Sang Woo.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.060
Order in the court.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:52.400
Defendant Cheon Sang Woo, found guilty of abetting murder,

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.870
is hereby sentenced to 15 years in prison.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:15.530
Here. Good work, everyone!

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:17.260
Thank you.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.980
Thank you for all the work.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:26.390
Thanks to you leading us well, things ended well.

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:29.130
I didn't do anything, I was just roped into it.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.710
What a shame to be roped in by a detective.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:34.840
Come on, why are you talking like that? A prominent case has been resolved fittingly.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.910
Let me ask you just one thing.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.800
Why do you live like that?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.180
Is it a desire for honor?

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.660
Or is it like a sense of justice? What is it?

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.480
It's nothing like that.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.500
You came along with us too.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:51.170
I had to because you guys kept luring me in like some water ghost.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.420
Why on earth do you live like that?

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.970
Because I'm a detective. What other reason could there be?

01:06:56.970 --> 01:07:00.560
You're overestimating yourself. Don't live like that from now on.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.760
Why are you suddenly tackling the way I live out of nowhere?

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.920
Are you rebelling against me again?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.370
You started speaking grossly first!

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:09.590
Do you still think detectives are lower than prosecutors?

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.510
I didn't think of you like that, but you're old-fashioned!

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:14.250
I'm not saying who's below or above.

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:17.630
A prosecutor puts detectives straight when they go astray! That's why I'm speaking like this!

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:21.090
Put straight, my ass! All you do is sign reports and sit at a desk!

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:23.050
What do you know about crime scenes?

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.490
Detectives can't see the whole of the situation!

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:27.140
How many cases do you deal with in a month?

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.080
I take care of the number of cases in a day that you do in a month!

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.120
- Come on, Oppa, why are you doing this to the prosecutor?
- You stay out of this!

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.670
- Oppa!
- It's nothing.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.800
Have you ever seen a murdered body?

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.590
Have you seen a body that you just can't see without looking away?

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:45.720
What about you? Have you ever struggled after sentencing someone to an execution?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.000
Huh? You just have to put handcuffs on and hand them over!

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.180
Your problem is that you think of detectives as a joke.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:53.360
You're the one I think of as a joke, not detectives.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.280
You little...!

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.550
That's the same thing! How old are you?

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.660
How old?

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.500
The chairman is coming.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.180
Chairman, how do you feel about being found not guilty?

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.830
Chairman Cheon Sang Woo was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:14.220
Do you think it has anything to do with you receiving a not guilty (verdict)?

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.610
What do you think the future of TJ will look like?

01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:18.660
What do you think was the basis of your pronouncement?

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.690
Please, a word.

01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:21.160
Please, no more questions.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.250
Please say one thing.

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.230
Please say one word for the program.

01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:28.110
Please, just one word, please!

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:29.860
Do you know why you were pronounced not guilty?

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:32.800
Please, one word!

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.090
Sorry about the struggle.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.690
You waited a long time, didn't you?

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:04.940
I'm sorry. I keep getting busy.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.320
It's okay.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.050
Take a seat.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.170
Grandpa, Ms. Hui Joo's situation...

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.600
I apologize in the place of my company and my family.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.230
No, no.

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:22.100
I have more to be sorry about.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.500
You must've been shocked by the result of the trial.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.390
I'm so sorry.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.400
You were very hurt because of my Hui Joo, right?

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.330
I

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.050
also believe that your husband's passing,

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:45.670
was because my Hui Joo made mistakes.

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:48.990
You don't have to think of it that way.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:55.760
My Hui Joo... please be generous and forgive her.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.030
Hui Joo must also be asking for your forgiveness on the other side.

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:05.290
Director Cheon, what would you like me to do for the tea?

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:08.750
I'll do it myself, he's a precious guest.

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.780
Are you okay with coffee?

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.730
Ah, yes.

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.950
Give me one moment.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.280
Yes, Team Leader?

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:35.800
The phone number was the team leader's office's.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.730
I'm sorry.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:43.630
That's okay, please continue, Director Cheon.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.000
Okay. I'll be there soon.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.510
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.750
I think I have to go right now.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.610
Go to the store first.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:04.600
I'll be back for dinner at the latest. Let's have dinner together.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.310
Okay. See you later.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.410
Okay.

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:14.380
Bye.

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:29.790
Oh my. Hui Joo.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.000
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.550
Did something happen?

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:51.060
Director Cheon.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:53.920
Yes?

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.340
Was it you, Director Cheon?

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:10.080

The reason why Gi Dong Jae died was that he told Woo Tae Ho about the culprit.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:40.630
If we investigate whether Gi Dong Jae murdered Jeong Hui Joo like you're saying,

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.920
and if we find out he didn't,

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.440
Cheon Sang Woo would be innocent.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.650
Dong Jae didn't leave anything with me.

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.240
I discovered what he hid while cleaning up his things.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.060
Please get rid of that evidence.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.410
Every trace of it.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.170
Do you think I don't know what you did?

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:59.180
The moment you covet something else, you lose the right to be my daughter.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.840
Protect me.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.030
We're both murderers.
