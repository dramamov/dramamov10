00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.400
I've slept for eight hours.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.400
But I'm still so sleepy.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.360
Sis, help me turn it off.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.240
Nian'er

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.960
No,

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.639
I feel like every morning

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.439
I just did this yesterday morning.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.960
Why has it turned into

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.120
having to do this every morning?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.759
It's a Calorie-Burning Day every morning.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.039
You only get up early once a week.

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.280
What are you complaining about?

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.199
For our dinner,

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.960
we have to get some exercise.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.879
To balance calorie intake and burn.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.960
So it all evens out.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680
One hour of moderate exercise

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.639
burns three to four hundred calories.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.680
It's really good for you.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.840
Hui

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.039
What's wrong?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280
Are you feeling unwell?

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.639
I think work's been too tiring lately.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.560
I walk around the office all day.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.479
Feels like I've burned all my calories.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080
Have I lost weight recently?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.919
Then maybe you should rest.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.240
Yeah, I'll rest too.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.000
Why?

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.560
I burn calories even when I sleep.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.319
Sleeping counts as exercise too.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.040
Exactly.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.240
I use my brain a lot when I dream.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:25.319
Why don't you say

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.199
when you eat,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.519
you're burning calories too?

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.199
Why don't you say

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.079
when you sleepwalk,

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:30.399
that's exercise too?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.560
Come on.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.000
Do ten more and you can rest.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.720
No,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.639
The reason you're working out

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.360
is it because of Du Peng?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.759
Want to beat him up?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.279
Hui, how about this:

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.279
Why not hire Du Peng at your company

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.680
and give him a hard time?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.519
Don't mess around.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.519
No, Nian'er,

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.439
let me tell you,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.279
if you really

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.120
want to get back at Du Peng,

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.519
I've got plenty of ways.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.639
Just tell me.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.079
Okay, ten.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.000
One.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:10.639
Two.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.399
Three.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.040
Four.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:24.079
Teacher Liang,

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.920
I'm leaving work now.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.600
Maybe it's time to give it back to him.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.959
Here you go.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.839
It's lunchtime now.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.800
I got you an extra portion.

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:34.399
Now that you mention it,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.199
do you know who I am?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.040
You're Liang Nian'er's good friend.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.519
You're pretty well-informed.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.079
That's because

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.600
Because of what?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.720
It's nothing.

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.680
Because you secretly met Nian'er

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.839
and know I'm the one

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.160
who lives with her.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.199
You could say that.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.480
Since you know

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.800
I'm her close friend,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
I appreciate your kindness.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.800
You...

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.519
What?

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.879
Are you mad?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.759
Say something.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.600
Cat got your tongue?

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:25.480
You really don't have to do this.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.399
I came here four months ago.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.639
I've been wanting to find Nian'er.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:34.879
But when I saw

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.560
her with you all,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.680
she looked happy and content.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.480
I felt I shouldn't disturb her.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.160
So I...

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.399
Don't you think you have a responsibility

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:49.399
to make up for all the hurt you've caused her?

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.680
I know I was wrong.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.439
I want to see her too.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.639
But I'm afraid.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.439
Do you still love Nian'er?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.040
I...

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.879
Now, it's more about...

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.240
I came to tell you today

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.959
I think she hasn't let you go yet.

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.320
But...

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.840
As a man,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.080
you should talk to her and make things clear.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.639
Don't hold her back anymore.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.360
Such a coward.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.799
In this world,

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.720
men who hurt Nian'er deserve to starve.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.240
You really are a coward.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.840
You really said that about him?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.879
Not a single word off.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.679
Well said.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.440
If it were me,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.679
I'd say the same.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.000
I think Nian'er

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.600
wants to say that to him too.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.039
But she can't bring herself to say it.

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:24.000
Then I'll say it for her.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:26.120
About you going to see Du Peng,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.600
don't tell Nian'er, okay?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.080
Don't be fooled by how Nian'er

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.039
seems so carefree.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.080
She actually doesn't like

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.519
others meddling in her love life.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.000
She can handle it herself.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.320
True.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.440
Isn't that Zhen Gui?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.000
Director Li.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.360
Li Yihan.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.879
From now on,

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.879
please call me Director Li.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.200
Zhen Gui,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.279
next time you come,

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.039
let me know in advance.

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.000
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.320
By the way, Zhang Hui,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.440
the research report is due, right?

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll give you five more minutes.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.399
Okay.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.720
How did I end up taking orders from you?

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.799
He convinced over ten veteran staff to quit.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.000
After joining the new company,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.200
the new boss fired all the old staff.

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.440
That's just too tragic.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.039
Is there some kind of scheme here?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:26.240
Li Yihan returned to the company seamlessly.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.000
He made a big show of loyalty.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.720
Our sales department happened to need people.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.639
He was promoted straight to sales director.

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:34.200
Two ranks above me.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:37.879
A real master of office politics.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.159
Are you saying there's a feast tonight?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.440
Yes, there is.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.639
Did I forget some special occasion?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.240
We have guests today.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.399
I'll get the door.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.279
Be polite.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.399
Hello.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.879
Hello.

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.480
Didn't expect Nian'er to invite

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.240
him today.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.519
Have some water.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.200
Thank you.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.240
Did Nian'er invite you here?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.000
No, no, no.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.120
My friend lives nearby.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
I just happened to pass by.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:08.799
So I dropped in to visit Teacher Liang.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.639
We all know about you two.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.240
So let's get straight to the point.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.840
Why do you like our Nian'er?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120
I don't really know.

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.440
I just do.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.679
I want a real answer.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.039
I like watching her cook.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.679
When she's cooking,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
she's totally focused.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.159
It's beautiful.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.919
Our Nian'er truly is a kitchen goddess.

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:05.879
So, no wonder.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.000
Zhengui.

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:09.639
Did you take a carrot?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.440
Teacher Liang.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.679
Why are you here?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.039
I just happened to pass by today.

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.039
So I stopped in to visit.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.200
These two are still pretending.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.200
Clearly, Nian'er invited a man for dinner.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.600
Stay and have dinner with us later.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.759
Okay.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.279
Have a seat.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:51.960
Wait, that's not right.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.799
It's your first time at our place.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.759
So how have you seen her cook before?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.559
Last year, at a team-building camp.

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:01.799
Nian'er showed off her cooking skills.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.720
Since then, I...

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.440
So that's it.

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.559
There's someone else?

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:17.600
They're here.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.399
Hello.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.320
Nian'er, Du Peng is here.

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:33.120
Stay calm.

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.679
Liang Nian'er, don't forget

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.279
why you invited him to this dinner.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:40.840
There's nothing

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.759
a dinner can't fix.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.480
Did Nian'er invite Du Peng today

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.879
and not Yin Zhanqi?

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.159
This is so awkward.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:43.960
What should we do?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.000
It's fine, let me handle it.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.399
Let me introduce everyone.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.960
This is Yin Zhanqi.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.039
Nian'er's suitor.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.440
This is Du Peng.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.320
Her ex.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.400
Hello.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:15.400
Hello.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.640
Hello, hello.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.519
Mission accomplished.

00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:03.880
The dishes are ready.

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:22.400
Let me introduce everyone.

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:23.599
This is

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:24.400
Yin Zhanqi.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:25.880
A colleague.

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:28.599
And this is

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:29.640
Du Peng.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:30.880
My friend.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
Already introduced.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.440
Tonight we're having

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:54.119
Braised Lamb Chop Hot Pot.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.640
Such a delicious dish.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.240
Some guests even brought gifts.

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.640
Some came empty-handed.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.039
I told him not to bring anything.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.640
So he's just here for a free meal.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200
What would you like to drink?

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.240
Water is fine for me.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.000
Thank you.

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.599
Have some juice.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.559
I'll pour for everyone.

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.039
Is orange juice okay?

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:35.920
Sure.

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:40.319
Thank you.

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:43.119
Here.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.519
Welcome, both of you.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.000
Welcome.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.839
Thank you.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:09.559
Thank you.

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.839
Everyone, eat the lamb chops while they're hot.

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:00.119
Is work going well for you lately?

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.119
It's been going pretty well.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.119
It's been ages since I had such a feast.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:13.359
This is my first time eating

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.119
lamb chops made by Nian'er.

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:16.640
It's delicious.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.519
Thank you.

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:21.880
You're welcome.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.759
First time.

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:25.920
Will it also be the last?

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.960
Eat more.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.480
I have to work overtime tonight.

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.400
Then I won't bother you.

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:51.319
I'll walk you out.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.880
Let's just say goodbye here.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.599
You still have guests at home.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.680
This is the laptop

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.200
you left here before.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.559
It should still work.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.319
So, can I sometimes

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.640
come over for dinner at your place?

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.680
I don't think so.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.319
Du Peng.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:04.640
Thank you for showing up again.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:07.880
It gave me a chance

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.720
to give myself closure.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.400
Let's end it here.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:17.720
Let's stop here.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.720
I've thought it through these past days.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.880
When we first got together,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.759
you said

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:29.079
no matter what problems we face,

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:31.240
even if it's hard, we shouldn't break up.

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:38.400
But now I want to tell you

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.319
if we break up,

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.200
we shouldn't get back together.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:49.920
Let's be strangers from now on.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.240
Otherwise,

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.960
both you and I will lose badly.

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:06.720
I'm no longer afraid of losing.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:19.920
Okay.

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:22.559
Thank you.

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.839
Good luck.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.319
Bye.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.240
Why aren't you keeping the guest company?

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.839
He said he needs to wash the dishes.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:25.640
I'm not that close with him,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.480
so it's fine.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.880
There's a secret about Nian'er hidden here.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.960
Nian'er has been saving money.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.000
Isn't it all for her late grandmother?

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:47.240
But there's another secret.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:50.839
Nian'er grew up with her grandmother.

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:52.920
Her father passed away early.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.839
Her mother remarried soon after.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.599
The person closest to Nian'er

00:27:56.599 --> 00:27:57.799
was her grandmother.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.319
Her grandfather was an Altay aid official.

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:03.319
He died in the line of duty there years ago.

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.079
So before her grandmother passed away,

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:06.519
she wished for her ashes

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.559
to be sent to Xinjiang,

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.119
to be buried with her husband.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:14.559
And to plant a tree there.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.759
To remain forever in Altay's soil.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.240
But moving a grave

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.319
is not an easy thing to do.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.960
Nian'er insists on fulfilling her grandma's wish.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.720
But her aunt spoke up.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.119
She said moving the grave is fine,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.799
but the money for the plot

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.119
and the funeral expenses

00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:33.319
must all be paid back to them.

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:34.039
How much?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.880
A lot.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:41.920
No wonder she's been saving so hard.

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.079
Thank you.

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:05.599
It's nothing.
