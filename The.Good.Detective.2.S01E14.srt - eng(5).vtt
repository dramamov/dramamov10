00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.850
Come on!

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.990
You're drinking too much.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.550
Grab him again.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.280
This was the last place that the phone sent a message.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.390
Where are we?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.400
That grandpa lives near here.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.690
- Yes, Eun Hye?
- Grandpa sent me a text,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.540
but it's weird.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.990
Grandpa says he's going to Hui Joo.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.680
But...

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.520
but he has never sent me a text before.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.030
And...

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.020
someone strange was at Grandpa's store just now,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.080
and I think he was rummaging through, trying to find something.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.580
Yes.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.060
Ahjussi,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.600
I think something happened to Grandpa. What do we do?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.100
Ahjussi, please...

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.280
please save Grandpa.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.780
I think they're trying to make it look like a suicide.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.800
The message sent to Eun Hye implies suicide.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.900
They took the phone from him and sent it themselves.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.300
Let's hurry before it's too late.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.000
Aigoo. My gosh.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.130
Hyeongnim! Someone is coming up!

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.890
Hey, hurry up.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.050
Pull!

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.030
Over there!

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.270
Hurry up!

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.330
Cut it! Cut it quickly!

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.640
- Hurry, cut the rope!
- Call the ambulance! Quickly!

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.470
Bring him down! Good, just like that.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.050
He's barely holding on by a thread.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.630
Grandpa, you can't leave like this.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.400
Please hold on.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.100
Put everything you have into breathing.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.000
There's one more thing you need to know, so...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.840
you have to survive. Please.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.400

[Administration | Discharge]

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.390
Grandpa.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.600
Please hold on just a little longer for me.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.980
Because I can't hopelessly let another person go like this again, Grandpa.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.370
Please!

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.200
We've found several footprints not belonging to any of us.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.270
They couldn't erase their traces because they were hurriedly running away.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.810
Once the forensics team finishes, we will find out who these guys were.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.690
What about the others?
[Intensive Care Unit]

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.420
They're probably checking the CCTVs nearby.
[Intensive Care Unit]

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.660
Okay. Keep the NFS team there until they've completely finished.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.580
Tell them I'll kill them if they don't work thoroughly.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.290
We can't miss even a single strand of hair, understood?

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.750
Yes.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.380
Good luck.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.070
He'll wake up.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.510
We can't say for sure since he's quite old,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.800
but he's a man with a strong will.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.900
He'll get back on his feet, I believe it.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.520
He wasn't trying to kill himself, right?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.720
No.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.280
That's clear.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.640
Why?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.400
Why did they do this to Grandpa?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.560
We're investigating that right now, so we'll know soon.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.700
It's probably him.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.770
I'm sure it's related to him.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.540
- Who?
- I saw that guy's face.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.000
The guy who tied me up at Grandpa's store and ran away.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.170
What?

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.440
Who the heck...?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.100
What on earth did he do to you?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.490
That guy was looking for something at Grandpa's store.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.230
And when he saw me, he blindfolded me so I couldn't see him.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.300
I saw him, though.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.870
Did you see him for sure?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.340
Is it someone you've seen before?

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.800
No.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.700
But I remember it clearly.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.940
Eyes, nose, lips.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.700
Every part of his face.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.180
I'm not sure.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.140
I can't remember. I'm sorry.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.260
It's okay.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.930
Dad.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.130
It's okay.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.080
I won't make the same mistake again. Never again.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.320
What did you do with Jeong Hui Joo's clothing?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.760
I burned it.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.170
Good job.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.320
There were no other issues, right?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.640
There's one thing that's bothering me, but...

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.000
Then you're saying that it wasn't cleanly taken care of?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.640
Correct.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.460
I heard Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather was in an accident,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.800
he's not dead, though.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.570
That must be bothering you a bit.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.460
I heard that, according to the doctor, he has no possibility of recovery.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.740
Such a shame, don't you think?

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.130
In any case, most of the problem is gone, right?

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.180
It's a bit early to judge that.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.000
I think we need to keep an eye on the situation a bit.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.090
Are you the kind of person who is only capable of that much?

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.300
Excuse me?

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.890
You're supposed to give me confidence.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:54.510
You should say, "It won't cause trouble, and even if it does, I'll take care of it."

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.330
I'll try, but...

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.740
So, why did you do things I didn't order you to?

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.670
You should take care of what you started.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.430
I understand. I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.950
I'll take care of anything that might cause trouble.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.600
I'm busy these days.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.530
There's so much to take care of within the company.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.500
If everything turns out well,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.300
I'll keep you close and bring you up with me.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.170
Yes.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.970
I understand.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.990
How did you know Mr. Jeong In Beom was in danger?

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.310
There's something I gave him.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.280
Because of that

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.160
those guys tried to kill the old man.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.410
What was it?

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.100
Hey, you guys.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.310
You went to Gi Dong Jae's brother and assaulted him, right?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.300
And it was also you guys who tried to fake Jeong Hui Joo's grandpa's suicide, right?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.560
Gi Dong Jae's brother already testified about everything.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.800
I heard you and Goo Jae Choon visited him, right!?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.320
We've found evidence related to you at the crime scene

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.020
and sent it to NFS, so the results will be out soon. Okay?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.440
We've also confirmed the van you guys drove using the CCTV footage.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.800
Plate number 2112, am I wrong?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.480
Throughout my entire career investigating gangsters,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.900
I've seen a lot of evil guys,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.570
but I've never seen bastards like you.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.360
Even if you're just some gangsters with no basic manners,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.100
he's your grandfather's age, you bastard. Hey, you're picking your ear?

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.070
Stop, stop, keep it together.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.700
Hey, you guys aren't even gangsters, you're just worms, dirty worms.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.370
You worms!

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.630
Why are you hitting us? Why?

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.000
Isn't this infringing on our human rights?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.850
Look at the shit coming out of his mouth.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.120
Human rights are only applicable for humans, you bastard.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.330
Calm down, stop. Try to calm down.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.300
These guys did nothing wrong.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.420
You did it because you were instructed to, right?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.110
You didn't want to, but someone higher up told you to, so you did it.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.440
Imagine if news of you messing up an 80-year-old man got out.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.740
Do you think you can survive going around

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.530
saying, "I'm a gangster"? Huh?

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.440
No, you can't because you'd be too embarrassed.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.210
If you go to jail, they won't even treat you like a human being. For a while,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.470
- you'll have to have your head stuck in the toilets!
- That's right.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.010
In this case, you should reveal who the true piece of garbage is.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.060
Was it Goo Jae Choon?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.940
Or is there someone else?

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.710
Well, the thing is....

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.790
I think Hyeongnim was ordered by someone too.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.000
Who is it?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.700
Well.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.030
Of course, I don't know either. Hyeongnim is the only one who knows.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.300
Seriously!

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.540
What brings you here?

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.550
I heard that Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather was in an incident.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.020
Did you guys find out why?

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.240
Well, that's still being investigated, so...

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.880
But why are you interested in that case?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.530
Right, not too long ago, I was investigating Gi Dong Jae going missing.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.640
I think Goo Jae Choon was related to that,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.880
and I think Goo Jae Choon might be behind this as well.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.100
Well, we're still investigating, so I don't have much to say.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.440
I'm not trying to steal this case away.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.150
I'm trying to hand the case to the Incheon West Station.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.090
I see. Is that so?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.890
But there's not much that's been found yet.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.720
On our side, we're keeping an eye on Goo Jae Choon's guys.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.820
We confirmed that they were dragged here this morning.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.840
That means that those guys are related to what happened with Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.490
right?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.190
I'm not sure.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.930
This here...

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.430
is evidence that shows Goo Jae Choon murdered Gi Dong Jae.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.020
My gosh, I've lost to the Incheon West Station guys again.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.470

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.800
I can't block this. I can't do anything anymore.

Are you trying to bail this late in the game?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.150
I just did as you asked me to.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.450
Go off grid for now.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.550
You need to give me time to fix this, alright?

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.750
I'll keep trusting you and waiting.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.920
Did she see me that day?

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.660
It's a forensic report
[Forensics Report]

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.550
that confirms it was Gi Dong Jae's blood on the deck of the ship that day.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.750
And this is

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.500
the boat owner's testimony

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.400
that says they lent the boat to one of Goo Jae Choon's guys.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.990
It's evidence that shows Goo Jae Choon killed Gi Dong Jae.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.490
But why do you think Jang Gi Jin gave this to us?

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.810
He told us to arrest Goo Jae Choon.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.420
Jang Gi Jin, that bastard. I think he's planning something.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.380
He's trying to pin Gi Dong Jae's death and terrorizing the grandpa, all on Goo Jae Choon,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.940
and wants personally remove himself from it.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:01.940
Oh, it's Eun Hye.

Hello.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.100
Eun Hye, what brings you in?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.410
I need to show you something.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.970
That's Jang Gi Jin.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.160
This guy is the guy who sneaked into Grandpa's store and stole something.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.110
I also saw him driving away from the station just now.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.690
What Gi Dong Jae's brother gave to the grandpa

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.880
was the clothing and shoes that Jeong Hui Joo was wearing when she was murdered.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.290
Jang Gi Jin went to find that at the grandpa's store.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.980
He made East Gangnam Gang members kidnap Grandpa,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.580
eliminate him by faking a suicide,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.770
and in the midst of that, he took Jeong Hui Joo's clothing.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.740
After confirming that the East Gangnam guys were arrested,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.900
he gave Gi Dong Jae's murder evidence to us.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.290
So he diverted our attention

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.740
to Goo Jae Choon.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.820
That was Jang Gi Jin's intention.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.880
Was something hidden in Jeong Hui Joo's clothing

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.820
that would cause him to try to kill someone?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.210
Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.760
That's why he kept the evidence instead of getting rid of it.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.820
Which means that amongst her clothing,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.010
there's evidence of who murdered Jeong Hui Joo.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.180
Jang Gi Jin is the team leader of the Seoul MIU.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.960
Which means that evidence is now in the police's hands.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.210
He's not a police officer anymore.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.800
He's a criminal.

Oh, yes.

Didn't I announce that we'd be having a president's meeting today?

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.780
Well, the honorary president suddenly changed the location,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.740
so I thought he'd tell you directly,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.650
but he must have not contacted you.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.730
I'm sorry.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.080
No, there's no reason to be sorry.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.910
I understand.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.440
Yes?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.490

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.650
the situation has turned quite bad.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.550
I would get several charges for this incident.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.620
Trespassing, assault, concealment of evidence,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.760

That's a lot.

Don't worry about it. I'll take care of the rest.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.180
You couldn't protect Chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.650
And now you're even in a prison uniform.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.680
Do you think I can keep trusting you in this situation?

the money I received alongside you will disappear into thin air, too.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.020
I'm serious this time.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.830
I'll protect you no matter what, so don't worry.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.120
I'll trust you if you tell me that.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.190
All I did

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.220
was get Jeong Hui Joo's body handed over to me,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.080
and then handed it over to Gi Dong Jae.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.710
I don't know who killed her or how.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.560
So,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.620

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.900
Then why at the trial...?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.620
Cheon Sang Woo had to go to jail for commissioning a murder

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.500
in order for us to receive the money.

That's all. Jang Gi Jin wasn't caught on anything.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.830
He moved only after checking the CCTVs in the area.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.090
Damned guy.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.580
Utilizing the things he learned as a detective like this?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.010
That means this is the only evidence we have.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.720
Did you find anything?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.110
Yes.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.510
Is there footage of Jang Gi Jin?

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.200
No. Jang Gi Jin isn't on anything,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.890
but Cheon Na Na is.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.900
Does this mean Cheon Na Na has something to do with this case too?

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.410
Yes. But the footage takes place during the daytime.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.000
It's far from the time that Eun Hye saw Jang Gi Jin.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.700
Is it a coincidence, then?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.940
Let's check with Cheon Na Na first.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.310
She went to the store for sure, so she'll say why she went there, one way or another.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.690
Cheon Na Na won't say anything directly.

Okay.

Don't you think the situation seems a bit suspicious?

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.470
Why, as soon as the fact that Cheon Na Na went to the store was revealed,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.880
did something happen to the grandpa?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.730

You were filmed on a dashcam that was in a truck near Mr. Jeong's store.

Why did you go there?

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.690
I went there to meet that grandpa.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.270
For what reason?

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.060
I don't think you'd believe me, no matter what I said.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.370
Since the grandpa is unconscious and you won't be able to hear his side of the story.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.430
I don't think I mentioned he was unconscious.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.990
Do you think I wouldn't have that information?

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.740
You should be thinking that my people are everywhere.

You're the person who did that to the grandpa.

If you dismantle and sell it, you'll be able to get quite a huge amount of money.

However, selling a Korean conglomerate after taking it apart

The public criticism toward you would be no joke.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:50.740
McQueen would probably try to abandon someone as a sacrifice.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.950
Who do you think would make the perfect sacrifice?

The thought of that is a bit too idealistic.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.250
TJ's situation is not in a state where I can save it with my own hands.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.830

of a chaebol company— that's what the world wants.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.840
You'd become the hero who made that ideal come true.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.990
Would that

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.740
be realistically possible?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.030
If I want it, it becomes a reality.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.550
You just need to do one thing.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.850
Yeah?

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.590
Are you available?

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.390
Let's meet.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.830
I'm sorry, I have plans.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.880
I've already sent a car. Drop by for a moment.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.510
I'll be there. I guess I should.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.390
Take a seat.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.070
You're busy, right?

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.790
It's not too bad.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.150
Shouldn't you apologize for breaking the promise you made at the shareholders' meeting?

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:49.250
Well, it's not an excuse, but the situation was really inevitable.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.610
Sure.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.180
What did the chairman say?

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.030
Well, he wanted advice.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.240
What kind?

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.540
You know the current situation well,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.070
as well as what the chairman wants from me.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.640
Did he talk about me too?

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.050
No, there wasn't anything like that.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:13.660
And? What's the conclusion you two came to?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.320
McQueen doesn't want this kind of bad news to keep coming out.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.570
It's possible that they might jump to the worst conclusions.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.110
The chairman wants direct negotiations with McQueen.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.550
But that would worsen the situation.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.060
So, these are just my own thoughts.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.980
Someone other than the chairman

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.710
should meet with McQueen and find a solution.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.230
Who?

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.700
You said you wanted to meet with our McQueen contact.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.950
You're telling me to go.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.340
No.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.230
I won't force you.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.310
What's good for the company versus what's good for you...

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.880
It's entirely up to you.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.050
You have a strange habit.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.270
When you're expressing an insincere emotion,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.410
you talk in English without realizing it.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.150
Wouldn't it be the opposite instead?

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.430
When I'm expressing my emotions, English is much more comfortable and easy for me.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.440
Okay, I'll think about it.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.470
You should go, you said you had plans.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.190
Okay.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.400
Call me when you come to a decision.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.620
Dad said it, didn't he? To send me to America.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.770
That he would send me to America and kill me!

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.130
No way. Absolutely not! I mean, why would you think that way?

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.040
I told you! I told you not to lie to me in English!

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.780
Na Na.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.170
Did you join my father's side too?

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.950
Are you strangling me after shaking hands with my father?

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.480
Let's pretend that I never suggested this to you.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.610
That's enough, right?

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:30.710
Tell Dad I won't die.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:35.300
And if I did, I would take down everything with me.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.520
Make sure you tell that to him clearly.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.090
You should be thinking that my people are everywhere.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.760
If you stop here, nothing will befall you.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.220
If I were the culprit, I think I would.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.210
How's Grandpa? Is he okay?

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.060
They said he had a brief heart attack.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.670
Luckily, he recovered right away.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.740
What was the cause?

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.260
I don't know.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.490
The doctors say they're not sure what the cause was.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:46.090
They said it might happen often since he's in serious condition. I guess we should trust the doctors.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.390
How did it go with Cheon Na Na?

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.080
Did she admit to meeting with Grandpa?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.470
Yes.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.810
What do you think?

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.850
It seems certain that Cheon Na Na is behind Jang Gi Jin, right?

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.490
For now, I think we shouldn't directly bug Cheon Na Na.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.010
Why suddenly? You were so confident.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.670
Are you scared of Cheon Na Na now?

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.250
Let's get Goo Jae Choon first.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.750
Once we get Goo Jae Choon and climb up through Jang Gi Jin,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.650
we'll be able to see Cheon Na Na.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.220
He must know that his guys were arrested.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.010
Do you think he went off the grid?

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.900
Right? What if he went abroad?

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.300
He's probably still keeping an eye on the situation.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.080
Because he probably thinks that the Seoul MIU team leader will protect him.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.270
Hey, you know Goo Jae Choon pretty well, right?

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.920
Is there a woman he's dating?

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.790
He likes women,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.340
but he's not the type who obsesses over a single woman.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.760
And it's been two years since I investigated him, so I don't know his relationships very well.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.620
I don't know where to start.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.930
Only by getting him first will Jang Gi Jin's crimes become clearer.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.490
Oh, there's one thing, Goo Jae Choon likes as much as he likes women.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.150

- Yes.
- How often does he come here?

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.360
I think he usually comes here at least twice a week.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.550
What does he usually order from here?

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.210
Well, usually the stew.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.560
Is there a type of dish that Goo Jae Choon especially likes?

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.790
He likes the stews from this place no matter what,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.610
and he likes the seasoned skin rather than the boiled meat.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.290
He won't eat here.

There's nothing else we can do but track the take-outs and delivery orders and follow them.

What are you doing here?

I wanted to clean it up before Grandpa came back.

Yes.

I can tell when I listen to him breathe.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.450
It's just a bit, but I think he's starting to relax.

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.740
You and Grandpa must have a deep connection.

Just... I liked the fact that he was there.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.600
Because I could run over and see him no matter when.

Jang Gi Jin, the Team Leader of the Seoul MIU, was here, right?

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.470
What did he leave with you?

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.530
Well, it's a personal request from Team Leader Jang.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.980
It's the heels, and clothing of a murder victim.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.700
Right?

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.150
Yes.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.180
The victim is Jeong Hui Joo.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.170
We at the Incheon West Station are in charge of the case.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.870
It's not a personal request.

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:16.210
We're going through an official process for the investigation.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.090
They're heels and clothing that were worn at the time of death.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.640
We're in the process of DNA identification.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.200
There's blood in various places.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.010
We've confirmed there's blood from more than one person.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.970
You're saying that another person's blood, besides the victim's, has been confirmed?

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.130
Yes.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.100
Have you identified it?

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.960
That will take some time.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.390
The results should come out within this week.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.530
That doesn't mean it'll definitely be identified, though, right?

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:45.590
There's some DNA data sent by Team Leader Jang that includes Gi Dong Jae's.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:49.950
If we compare it with that, it should be identified soon.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.130
When the results come out, please give us a call right away.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:54.730
Okay.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:54:00.410
If Gi Dong Jae's blood is found, it would be fine.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.930
But if it's some random person's blood?

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.890
It means we'd be back to the start of the investigation.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.050
Aigoo.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.460
Why doesn't this case ever end?

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.440
No matter how far we go, we're still in the same spot.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.410
- Hello?
- In this situation,

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.380
there's only one thing for me to say to everyone.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.720
"Young Policemen, the country believes in you."

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.060
Yes, that's it.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.890
Okay.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.400
Kang Do Chang, the marketing team called.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.560
For the charity event being held at TJ,

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.670
they're inviting you and Oh Ji Hyeok.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.970
We must be their enemy, so why?

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:39.750
Why? I can see their intentions.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.450
What are their intentions?

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.320
Invite these two, and...

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.000
Bang! Bang!

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.580
Like the chief said, a million per person.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.050
I've learned that the chief of the Incheon West Station is your father.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:59.000
Is that right?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.530
Yes.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:05.340
Then you must know very well about the detectives at Incheon West.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.810
Well, it's just that we're planning on a lawsuit.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.450
It's something we've been postponing due to the trial.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:17.000
Illegal investigation and defamation.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.750
We'll be suing each and every one of the detectives.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.940
They underestimated a conglomerate, and they'll be paying for that.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.970
You'll be taking charge and working on it.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.260
Why should I?

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.090
The former team leader hired you for something specific, right?

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.840
But didn't you fail?

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:45.520
On the contrary, I think you instead leaked disadvantageous information about the company.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.380
I'm giving you a chance to recover from that.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:52.500
[Letter of Resignation]

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.630
I was wondering when to turn this in.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:58.870
You've given me an excuse.

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:03.160
If you quit like this, the aftermath won't be good.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.980
I wasn't part of this department for very long,

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.440
so I can't bring down this disgusting company.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.920
However, I have enough data to ruin a certain high-ranked individual.

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.080
Do you want to try me and see whose aftermath would be worse?

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.910
There's one thing I've learned while working here.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:24.940
"You have to deal with dirty, unfair people by being dirty and unfair too."

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.930
"That's the only way for them to know how rotten they smell."

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.000
Boneless yangnyeom chicken here. Enjoy.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.500
Let me know if you need anything.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.100
Okay.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.840
It's doing well.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.480
It really is.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.070
Yes. It's doing better than I thought.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:57.270
It's because the food is good, and Ms. Eun Hui works hard too.

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:03.460
By the way, I'm asking because I don't know about it,

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:08.630
but when you're frying chicken, do you have to personally cut up the chicken to fry it?

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:12.670
Or do you fry pre-cut chicken sent by the headquarters?

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.770
Well, I don't know.

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:18.410
Ask Ms. Eun Hui later.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:23.410
Okay. I should come back when it's less crowded and ask.

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:26.010
Why? Chief,

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.490
are you going to open a chicken restaurant?

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.300
I'm thinking about it. But...

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.390
I don't think I can work with whole raw chicken.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:39.310
When I was young, I went to my grandmother's house.

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:43.470
I was traumatized after seeing my grandmother twisting the chicken's neck.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.970
So, even now, I can't eat chicken.

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:51.160
Now that I think about it, I don't think I can do chicken.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.070
Chief, aren't you curious?

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.810
- About what?
- Jang Gi Jin, that guy,

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:58.970
left something to identify at NFS,

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:02.050
- and from there─
- Pig. I think I'd be okay with pigs.

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:04.070
Pork foot or pork belly!

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.110
You wouldn't have to kill a pig for that, right?

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:10.850
Chief, if this goes wrong, we might have to release Cheon Sang Woo─

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:13.940
Why are my ears getting all muffled suddenly?

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.940
I can't hear. I can't hear anything at all.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.350
- Chief.
- I can't hear. I can't hear. I can't.

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:25.800
I heard cows make better profit than pigs.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.830
Is cow better?

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.910
Hey.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.710
What are you doing here instead of going home?

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:48.610
Just because.

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:34.760
Dad.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.390
Bo Kyeong,

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.340
let's not say anything today.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:48.800
There's no reason for us to suffer twice as much.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.280
Yeah.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:11.830
So, TJ's people will sue us?

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:12.980
Why?

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.920
Because you poked TJ.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.960
They always make sure to seek proper retaliation.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.040
Be sure to prepare for that. They're really scary people.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.130
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:28.420
A detective job is one that deals with scary people in the first place.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.500
If you get sued, they might take everything you have.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.480
I already have nothing. What else could they take from me?

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.930
If it goes badly, you might not even get promoted anymore.

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:42.000
Being a detective has nothing to do with promotions.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.540
It's all about the experience as detective.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.040
They might cause harm to your family too.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.010
Well, all I have that I call family is my jobless younger brother.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.210
The only way to cause harm to him

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.180
is to go into the game that he's playing

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.980
and take all his items. If you do that, he will go crazy.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.630
Well, then I worried for no reason.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.640
I'm going to go now.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.970
Hey, if you didn't eat yet, would you like to...?

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.980
There's a blood sausage soup restaurant that's really good, I'll buy.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.590
No, no. You have nothing and no desire to get promoted,

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.180
and you have a jobless family member to take care of. How could I eat when you pay?

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.210
It'd be like trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.080
I'll just go.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.610
- But...
- Bye.

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:31.110
Was I too honest?

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.440
Do you think she's disappointed in me?

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.290
What did you expect?

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:38.120
You conjured every condition that women hate.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.230
Everything I've built up with her is gone.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.110
What did you build up? What?

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.040
You've built up nothing.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.250
Built what...

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.630
Should I have asked to eat bone soup instead?

[Charity event to raise money for the Jeong Hui Joo Scholarship Foundation]

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.610
Thank you for attending the Jeong Hui Joo Scholarship Foundation establishment event.

Hey, what do you think her intentions are?

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:22.240
Does she mean to at least take moral responsibility for Jeong Hui Joo's murder?

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.670
I'm not sure.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.370
Yes, thank you.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.630
Excuse me for a moment.

- Why did you─
- You should be here.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.890
You're the people who revealed the truth behind Jeong Hui Joo's murder.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.770

Thank us?

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.130
- For us?
- I'm thankful.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.610
Especially to you, Detective Oh. You saved me.

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:56.590
That day, the day when my brother tried to kill me.

01:02:56.590 --> 01:03:00.600
That was something any detective should do as a detective.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.680
That's why I like you.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.730
You don't have any personal feelings.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.510
That's all I want.

It seems that TJ Group is in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.410
What do you think is the cause for your current situation?

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.460
To be honest, I believe

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.870
that it's because of the unfortunate events that my family is currently going through.

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:58.680
Former Chairman Cheon Seong Dae was sentenced to prison for corruption,

and now his son, and the current chairman Cheon Sang Woo,

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:04.770
has just been arrested under the suspicion of murder.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.970

your company is currently facing this crisis?

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:12.230
Yes, I must admit it.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.650
But I must add that all of these events

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.970
started with me,

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.890
and that the reason I agreed to do this interview

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:20.920
was because I wanted the chance to talk about it.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.460
So what you're implying is that

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.030
your company's issues have actually all started from you.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.880
Yes.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.840
Could you go into further detail, please?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.140
The reason why former chairman Cheon Seong Dae had to go through the trial while implicated for corruption,

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.200
was actually because I reported it.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.330
And Chairman Cheon Sang Woo's crime was also

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:44.290
revealed because I handed over decisive evidence to the investigative agency.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:48.570
But why would you do something like that? Aren't you all family?

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:51.660
TJ's crisis is something that began a long time ago.

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.380
We were just hiding it.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.530
I decided that exposing those exact faults and coming clean

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:59.280
is the only way TJ can start anew.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.310
If I may, are the former and current chairman aware of your actions?

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:07.480
Yes, but

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.780
they have it all wrong.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.620
They think

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.370
I'm trying to get back at them for my mother, who committed suicide.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.290
That's the most unfortunate part.

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:23.780
First, I need to sincerely apologize

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.610
to all the TJ staff members,

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:28.460
who have worked tirelessly in the past and present,

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.840
and to all shareholders who believed in TJ and invested in us.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.720
We at TJ will get back on our feet.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.170
I want to make a promise.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.840
I vow to learn from the missteps and move forward

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.330
to resurrect TJ as the type of company you will be proud to be a part of

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:45.820
with my own hands.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.920
I saw the broadcast.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.240
I think that was a bad move.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.100
The stock price is going down.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.260
If you saw the broadcast, you probably know

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.150
that the whistleblower who sent the document to the Blue House was me.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.060
I thought there was a possibility.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.670
However, the thought that "it couldn't be" was bigger.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:08.050
I sent the document that Team Leader Woo Tae Ho was keeping safe.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.490
It was only a small part of something bigger.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:14.110
The decisive part exists elsewhere.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.350
Why?

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.640
You spoke to the honorary president, right?

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.410
"I will install Michael Cha as the future CEO."

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.890
He's like a doctor to TJ.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.690
A doctor that can save the dying TJ.

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:33.230
However, no doctor can save a person who's already dead.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.630
Director, everything's ready.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:40.750
Okay. I'll be back after I fix my makeup.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.780
The deceased Ms. Jeong Hui Joo was a capable employee.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.140
She did her part until the very end,

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.640
and she was an employee who did her best in everything.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.740
Unfortunately, it's something that's truly unbelievable,

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.030
but due to a momentary lapse in our chairman's decision-making,

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.500
she left this world.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:40.160
And even her grandfather, who was her only guardian,

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.290
is lying ill at the hospital.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.700
W-We...

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.140
remember employee Jeong Hui Joo's bright smile.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.390
What's going on?

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:03.120
Today, for the employee Jeong Hui Joo who died unfairly,

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.000
- and for her grandfather, the bereaved...
- What's going on with her?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.880
She looks sick.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.670
we are starting a foundation with a meaning.

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.670
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West's Violent Crimes Team.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.290
The results of the bloodstains left on Ms. Jeong Hui Joo's clothes came out.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.610
We've finished comparing the DNA as well.

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.570
I understand.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.840
They found who the blood on Jeong Hui Joo's clothing belongs to.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.510
Who?

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:27.390
Cheon Na Na.

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.320
The establishment of the Jeong Hui Joo scholarship foundation,

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.040
is to ask for forgiveness from her─

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.860
Is she okay?

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:59.960

Cheon Na Na is coming.

You're misunderstanding me a bit. I apologize.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.720
She hit us in the eyes in case she'd get hit first.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.420
All of your team members are about to get fired. What are you going to do?

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.940
I think Jang Gi Jin really got us this time.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.790
How are we supposed to turn this situation around?

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:37.200
We should get someone to have our backs, too.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.300
Chairman, there's something I need to tell you.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.610
I'll show you a world where my thoughts become reality.

01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:43.740
Please help.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.550
I've put my whole life on the line.

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.270
That scummy bastard started this fight first.

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:49.910
We have to win.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:53.350
Only then can we catch Cheon Na Na.
