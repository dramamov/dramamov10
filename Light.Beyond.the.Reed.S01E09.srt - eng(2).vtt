"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

=Episode 9=

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.260
(Certified Public Accountant Exam)

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.180
(Chuchu quit her job.
Don't you feel guilty?)

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.660
(You troublemaker.)

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.500
Sibei.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.450
You haven't called me in so long.
Did you miss me?

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.290
Chuchu.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100
You quit your job?

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.540
You found out so soon.

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.340
It has nothing to do with you.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.980
That company's way too dangerous.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.060
I don't want to stay there.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.550
Besides, it's full of scheming people.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.020
I've wanted to leave for a long time.

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:03.444
How did they threaten you?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.500
I'll go talk to them.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.220
They didn't exactly threaten me.

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:09.260
They just wanted me
to talk some sense into you.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.130
But I wasn't having it.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.260
Why should I?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.780
Instead of going after Fan Jiancheng,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.466
they've been pressuring you nonstop.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.610
So I told them straight up

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.450
that I quit.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.100
I can just get a new job.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.730
I'm getting married soon anyway.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.660
I don't care.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.610
I'm sorry.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.260
I'm sorry, Chuchu.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.100
Sibei.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.660
I should be the one saying sorry to you.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.260
If only I'd been more cautious that day.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.730
If only I hadn't trusted him so easily.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.540
It wasn't your fault.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.890
It wasn't your fault either.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.820
I really am sorry.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.850
Forget it, let's not talk about this.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.060
I'm on the street right now.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060
If I cry off my makeup,
I'll look terrible.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.460
Anyway, I've quit.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.730
I'll go find a new job tomorrow.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.644
Considering how capable
and beautiful I am,

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:23.250
I can definitely find another job.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.250
Right, Sibei?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.290
I'm sorry...

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.220
That's enough, Sibei.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.460
Let's just drop the subject.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.370
Since we've filed the case,
let's go all the way.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.900
We'll show them what we're capable of.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.100
I'll hang up now.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.220
Did they threaten Chuchu?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.730
I'm going to the police station.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.020
I'll come with you.

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:25.580
(Here's two hundred thousand.)

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580
(This money)

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.220
(is more than enough
to pay off your loan.)

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.780
(And you can save the remaining amount.)

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.740
(Ye Sibei.)

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.580
(If you have any concerns,)

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.660
(just tell us.)

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.410
(The company will work it out.)

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.340
(Is this your compensation?)

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.730
(You can interpret it however you like.)

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.290
(But once you take the money,)

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.460
(just explain things clearly.
That's fine, right?)

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.220
(Explain what?)

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.850
(Don't play dumb.)

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.900
(You sued Mr. Fan.)

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.780
(That hurt the company's reputation.)

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.170
(You know that, don't you?)

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.780
This is such an important recording.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.370
Why didn't you give it to us then?

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.610
I didn't want to drag others into it.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.410
But now they've gone too far.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.900
They even forced Chuchu to quit.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.220
How outrageous they are.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.730
What are you still worried about, Sibei?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.620
You did great.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.020
Whenever something like this happens,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.460
you have to collect the evidence.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.730
If they dare to do it again,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.020
just tell them

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.170
that threatening
or bribing others to lie

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.490
is a criminal offense.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.730
Sibei.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.250
Don't be afraid.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.066
If something like this happens again,

00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:37.250
gather your evidence,
and come to me right away.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.410
I know you're all pretty busy.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.020
It's a small matter.

00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.730
As long as the case goes smoothly,
that's enough.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.170
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.020
Export this file.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.020
Officer Lin.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.860
Captain Zhang.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020
No need to see us out.

00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:00.570
Thank you for the day.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.010
Don't mention it.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.900
Head home and get some good rest.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.770
Thank you.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.220
In fact, it hasn't been easy

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.340
for either of them.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.340
Right, Master?

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.050
Master!

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.050
Now isn't the time

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.540
to look at the flowers.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.570
What a pity.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.580
Isn't the key with you?

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.900
Just move it yourself.

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:48.620
Make good use of our time.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.420
Give them an explanation
as soon as possible.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.460
Yes, sir.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.660
Chuchu!

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.620
Chuchu.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.820
You're off work

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.250
so early today.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.850
I quit, too.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.500
What?

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.130
You quit too?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.250
What happened?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.490
What else could it be?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.580
You think I would
try to persuade Sibei and you

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.330
to make peace with them?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.490
No way.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.330
Well...

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.730
Yet you did them a favor

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.180
by quitting, you know?

00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:06.730
You should have waited for them

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.450
to get impatient and fire you.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.250
Then they'd have to pay compensation.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.780
You're something.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.490
Now you know how to use legal means.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.970
I finally witness your professionalism.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.330
Stop teasing me.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.020
Lately, I often feel useless.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.940
It's okay.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.540
It's a good thing.
You never liked my job anyway.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.100
You said there were
too many social events.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.570
Great. We can now start over, right?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.940
Let's start over.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.180
(Guantian Police Station)
Sibei. This is an accusation.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.180
Officers.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.420
I didn't tell her
to give false testimony.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420
I just told her

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.610
to tell the truth,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.330
so we could help her.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.860
I'm sorry.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.820
Stop bothering those around me.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.180
We won't.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.250
Why would we do that?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.060
Besides,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.222
this has nothing to do with us anyway.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.130
It better be.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.900
Ye Sibei.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.130
Aren't you tired?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.300
Aren't you tired?

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.210
Who isn't?

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.210
However, no matter what,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.970
we need

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.300
to get on with it.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.300
Let's go.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.330
I'll think of a way.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.620
(Go to hell, Ye Sibei.
You're disgusting and shameless.)

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.820
Check that out.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.820
How pitiful.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.130
Let's lend them a hand.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.210
- We'll help them out.
- Okay.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.540
Let's go help them too.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.250
Thank you.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.730
Thank you.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.540
Thank you.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.420
- You'll be fine.
- You're doing great.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.900
You got this, young lady.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.130
- You can do it.
- You'll be fine.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:38.900
- You got this.
- Keep going.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.580
(Dad)

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.860
Hello, Dad.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.300
Sibei.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.490
Come home now.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.730
Something happened to your mom.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:56.820
What happened to her?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.900
She fainted.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.300
Come home quickly.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.420
Then call 120
and take her to the hospital.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.420
Why don't you send her to the hospital?

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.300
Come home first and we'll discuss it.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.140
What's wrong?

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.730
My dad said my mom is sick.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:13.900
I have to go check on her.

00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:15.730
But he won't take her to the hospital.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.660
I just feel like

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.490
something's off.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.860
I'll come with you.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.860
Okay.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.210
You go up first.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.422
I'll find a place to park.

00:13:28.444 --> 00:13:28.970
Sure.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.420
I said, just sell the house.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.490
I don't want it.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.200
I'll stay single

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.288
and stand by my sister
and fight the case to the end.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.755
We own this house too.

00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:45.730
Have you asked
for your mom's permission?

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.733
Have you asked for mine?

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:47.940
Have you asked for Chuchu's?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.600
You can't sell it
just because you want to!

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.090
What...

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.090
What's on your mind?

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.140
Sibei.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.210
Where's Mom?

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.050
In the room.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.700
Sibei.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.060
Listen to me. Leave. Head back first.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.970
Nianwen, what are you doing?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:02.940
Dad, what is this?

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.450
Sibei.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.180
Come.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.140
- Come.
- Dad.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.380
Come here.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.450
Look at your mom.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.660
Look what she's become.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.690
Mom.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.300
Mom, what's wrong?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.820
She hasn't taken anything or gone out

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.850
for days.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.370
Sibei.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.940
- Sibei...
- Sibei.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.500
Hello.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.820
Zhao Shuhui.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.370
Was it you?

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.500
What?

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.060
You were behind
what happened to my brother, right?

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.250
Who's your brother?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.180
What happened to him?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.490
You're the one who called me.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.180
I'm the defendant's family,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.900
so we shouldn't be in contact.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.311
You're getting revenge, aren't you?

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.610
Didn't you get what the police said?

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.820
That's enough.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.900
I haven't contacted you, have I?

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.370
Then why were my brother
and Chuchu forced to quit?

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.060
You should ask them.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.730
Maybe they just aren't capable enough.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.900
They got in through connections anyway.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.660
Instead of working,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.060
why did they quit?

00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:38.730
Let's check on Mom first.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.610
Mom, how are you feeling?

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.660
If you're not feeling well,
why not go to the hospital?

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.300
I'm alright.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.940
I'll be fine after a nap.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.020
Forget about saving money.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.466
Go get checked if you feel unwell.

00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:22.555
I'm not going.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.180
How did I raise such a daughter?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.420
When will you finally grow up?

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.370
You've been stubborn, willful,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.644
and sharp-tongued since you were little.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.540
And you've always
competed with Nianwen.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.820
You've always said

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.020
we're being unfair,

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.190
and we always play favorites.

00:16:44.222 --> 00:16:45.370
Now that you've grown up,

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.540
you just keep running away.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.250
We finally got you home,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.060
and you still think
we're holding you back.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.370
We didn't have a single relative
in that big city.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.180
You were all alone.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.060
If something happened,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.300
could your dad and I

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.820
just grow wings and fly to you?

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.300
We hoped you'd grow up

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.610
and become more sensible.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.650
When will you...

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.170
When will you ever understand?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.650
You keep saying

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.930
I don't care about you,

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.300
and I don't love you.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.410
That I want to hurt you.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.170
Ye Sibei, I'm your mother.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.300
Would I ever hurt you?

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.610
You're a girl.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.820
Tell me how I should treat you.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.288
Tell me how I should love you.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.450
Your grandma,

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:25.300
your aunt,

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.500
and I have been there.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.244
None of us ever complained about things.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.260
In the end, women just

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.100
get married

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.650
and have kids.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.610
Isn't that right?

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.300
Why can't you do the same?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.410
Why do you have to ask for so much?

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:41.930
Mom, let's not talk about this.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.060
It's not good for your health.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.930
Tell me about it.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.140
I'm all ears.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.170
What did I do wrong?

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:55.500
Say something.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.740
I don't get it either.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.500
How can you find this blatant unfairness

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.370
normal?

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740
You didn't go to school,

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.650
so my uncle could.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.170
You took care of Grandma,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.840
but all the property went to my uncle.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.650
Don't you feel any resentment at all?

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.170
No.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.010
You do.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.930
But everyone told you that's wrong.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.820
That it's selfish and ungenerous.

00:18:22.244 --> 00:18:24.370
You were forced
to live that way your whole life.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.060
So you think I should do the same.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.930
I know you love me.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.500
But your love for me
isn't the same as for Nianwen.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.020
What you have for me isn't just love.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.580
There's jealousy too.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.010
Sibei.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.060
I'm jealous of you?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.500
I'm your mother. I'm jealous of you?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.060
What would I be jealous of?

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.930
You can't accept
that I won't live like you.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.410
Because that means
rejecting your whole life.

00:19:13.088 --> 00:19:14.740
You keep saying it's for my own good.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.610
But sometimes you can't tell good

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.610
from bad.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.450
Yes.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.060
I can't tell good from bad,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.900
but you do.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.300
Times have changed, Mom.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.930
I know why you didn't
want me to go to the police.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.610
But look.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.540
Nianwen supports me.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:37.930
Chuchu supports me.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.300
Qin Nan supports me, too.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.300
Times have changed.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:43.850
Times have changed?

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.930
Then... Then why am I still lying here?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.020
Have you ever seen your dad
this anxious before?

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.980
Sibei. If times have changed,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.650
why are you still
wasting your time here?

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.300
You're the victim.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.370
You should have won by now.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.370
Why is it never-ending?

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.740
You're right about one thing.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.410
I do treat Nianwen better than you.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.930
Because he's a boy.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.770
Right?

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.300
I know it's unfair to you.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.890
But Sibei,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.060
can you listen to me, please?

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.540
Heed my advice

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.020
and negotiate with them.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.260
Name a number and end it all.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.170
We can't keep doing this.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.140
Sibei.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.130
Sibei.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.060
Come out now.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.900
Something happened!

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:23.930
Sibei.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.300
What is it, Nan?

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:26.930
What happened?

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.930
We have to go home now.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.890
Mom, we're leaving.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.820
What happened, Nan?

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.130
Officer Lin just called.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.580
Someone's been snooping at the station.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.220
They might be coming for us now.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.170
We have to leave now.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:41.755
- Mom, we're off.
- Nianwen, lock the door.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.300
Slow down, Nan.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.650
- Ms. Ye! Ms. Ye!
- Ms. Ye!

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.370
Let's go!

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.610
- Ms. Ye!
- Ms. Ye!

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.970
Where are they?

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:03.850
Check over there.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:04.690
Here.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.460
They're gone.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.410
How could this happen?

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.410
Sibei.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.220
Dad, what's the situation there?

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.300
Don't worry about it.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.540
Nianwen has called the police.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.000
He and your mom are driving them away.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.370
Don't come back. You hear me?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.610
She's not Ms. Ye!

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.020
She's not! You've got the wrong person!

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.740
(How absurd. Behind sexual assault
is continuous personal persecution.)

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.780
(We strongly urge authorities
to take this case seriously.)

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.866
(The case has been handed over
to the procuratorate.)

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.460
(The victim is innocent
and shouldn't be blamed.)

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.300
(That rapist is absolute trash.)

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.260
(Does he have a daughter? Isn't he afraid
the same could happen to her someday?)

00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:03.890
Was it you who contacted the media?

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.130
Of course not.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.610
All those online posts

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.850
and ridiculous rumors,
that was your doing, right?

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.170
It wasn't me.

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:11.644
You did those awful things

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.370
and someone posted them online.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.610
It has nothing to do with me.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.330
What more do you want?

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.460
I haven't even pushed you
to the edge yet.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.530
Haven't you?

00:23:19.777 --> 00:23:21.650
You had those people
splash paint on my house.

00:23:21.777 --> 00:23:23.500
You had them harass me
and send me texts.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.130
You got Chuchu fired.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.610
And you said
you haven't pushed me to the edge?

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.980
Chuchu quit on her own.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.170
You gave her an impossible choice.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.410
And you call that voluntary resignation?

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.850
This has nothing to do with me.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.610
Those self-media posts
have nothing to do with me either.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.730
Ye Sibei.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:47.970
Listen here.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.370
Not you alone

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.610
have paid the price for what happened.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.580
We haven't had it better either.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.330
Now that it's come to this point,

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.610
have you ever considered

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.130
if you're at fault too?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.650
No.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.170
I...

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.210
I...

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.860
I...

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.730
Sibei.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.860
It's alright.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.580
We're all ready.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.170
From now on,

00:24:34.822 --> 00:24:36.177
stop looking at your phone.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.300
They're doing all this

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.980
to stop you.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.930
Sibei.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.980
They're afraid of you.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.300
Why is Sibei

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.220
being so stubborn?

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.090
If she gives in to them

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.355
and negotiates with the Fan family,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.500
the problem will be solved, right?

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.500
Why don't you get it, Dad?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.650
It's not something to give in.

00:25:27.177 --> 00:25:28.540
We've managed to come to this point

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.955
because Sibei hasn't given in to them.

00:25:30.088 --> 00:25:31.600
If Sibei hadn't filed that lawsuit,

00:25:31.622 --> 00:25:33.300
the Fans wouldn't have come
to negotiate.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.260
Now they've come to us.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.133
No matter how much money they offer,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.530
as long as we take it,
Sibei will forever be accused

00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:39.800
of making a false accusation.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.650
Dad, are you trying
to push Sibei to the edge?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.300
How could you say

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.911
I'm trying to push her to the edge?

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.820
Can't she take
some minor grievance in life?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.260
You call this a minor grievance?

00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.300
Since ancient times,
there has been injustice.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.500
How can you say
this is just a minor grievance?

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.500
Well, Dad,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.740
if it were you, could you stand it?

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.690
Yes!

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.740
I can stand anything.

00:26:00.577 --> 00:26:02.800
I've put up with plenty
for your sake and your sister's.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.980
I haven't said anything

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.300
these past two months.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.260
But now we can't even
bring food to the table.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.330
What can you do?
Can you magically make money appear?

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.540
I've told you a million times
to sell the house.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.500
Have you asked for Chuchu's opinion?

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.850
Are you going to do this to her?

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.580
Guifen.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.980
Look at your son.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.377
He's about to do something stupid.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.260
Go check if they're gone.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.890
It's late.

00:26:52.022 --> 00:26:53.170
They should've left by now.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.850
It's getting late.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.980
Get Chuchu home already.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.090
Guifen.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.170
You should talk to Nianwen.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.220
Can you stop it?

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.420
Chuchu.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.020
It's pretty late.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.260
I'll send you home.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.300
Okay.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.580
Let's go.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.260
Say goodbye to Mom.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.980
Mrs. Ye,

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.060
I'll be leaving now.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.300
Take care.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.260
Let's go.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.650
Let's just stop here.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.740
Chuchu.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.260
Our house...

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.020
I might have to sell it.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.740
I'm sorry. I...

00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.740
I'm not capable enough.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.460
Given my family's situation,

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.220
I really have no idea when I can

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.020
give you a stable life.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.860
So...

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.580
So you know, I...

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.540
I really don't want you
to suffer with me.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.380
I mean...

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.980
We...

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:22.500
We...

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.340
Ye Nianwen.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.980
Do you love me?

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.300
As long as you love me

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.740
and care about me, that's enough.

00:29:35.244 --> 00:29:37.220
Honestly, I don't care
that much about the house.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.980
What I care about is you.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.460
It's okay.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.020
We're still young.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.410
We can take our time
and make money together.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.660
Right?

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.490
Right?

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.020
You've grown up.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.540
You're amazing.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.220
Just bear this in mind.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.410
No matter what happens in the future,

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.740
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.580
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:23.090
Okay.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.300
I'll bear that in mind.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.300
Always.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.740
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.410
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.170
Just go to the shop.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.466
You don't have to stay with me.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.020
You still need to make money.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.540
How will you get back later?

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.820
I'll take the bus.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.340
Don't worry.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.530
I'm off.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.260
Officer Lin.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.300
Ye Sibei?

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.330
Do you have a cold?

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.300
You're all bundled up.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.340
No.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.460
Come with me.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.500
Drive slowly.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.300
Stay safe. Bye.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.300
Okay.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:52.860
Nan.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.300
Nianwen?

00:31:56.955 --> 00:31:57.740
What's the matter?

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.580
Nan.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.330
There's a warning light on

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.330
in my car.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.300
Can you take a look?

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.140
Sure.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.820
Oh, right, Nan.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.410
There's been progress on Sibei's case.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.300
The procuratorate
has filed charges in court.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.330
Jun.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.540
Pass me the scanner.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.580
Ask whatever you want.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.170
I'll answer what I can.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.977
Otherwise,
I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.500
Do I just wait for the trial now?

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:39.820
Yes.

00:32:39.977 --> 00:32:41.260
When it comes to cases like this,

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.500
it takes no more than three months

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.220
to get your verdict.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.460
For a case like mine,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.740
what are my chances of winning?

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.060
I understand.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.850
Before the verdict,

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.300
nothing's certain.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.330
You and Captain Zhang
have really worked hard.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.820
I'll head back now.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.300
Ye Sibei.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.330
For you,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.300
it should be over now.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.410
Now that it's in our hands,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.020
we'll put an end to it.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.260
You don't need to stay stuck.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.580
You can look ahead now.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.490
I know.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.980
I'm studying for an exam.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.740
I'll be taking the CICPA test.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.140
Thank you.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.170
Take care.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.300
Say what's on your mind.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.330
I can't figure it out.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.820
Then stop trying.

00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:56.177
That brain of yours
won't figure it out anyway.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.490
Master.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.820
Ye Sibei is clearly the victim.

00:34:02.022 --> 00:34:03.860
Why does she have
to put up with all this?

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:05.810
You should've seen

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.540
how she covered herself
so tightly just now.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.210
Why do victims have to carry such shame?

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.810
What did she do wrong?

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.420
Stop asking why.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.020
Do you think this is an exam

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.580
where you write the right answer

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.460
and get points?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.650
What is reality?

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.290
What is life?

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.290
It's when you know the right answer,

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.730
but you

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.810
can't act

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.650
accordingly.

00:34:29.222 --> 00:34:30.540
There's no standard answer to it.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.810
That's what reality is.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.355
(The rapist's wife and daughter.)

00:35:31.355 --> 00:35:32.210
What are you doing?

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.420
Don't block our way!

00:35:33.777 --> 00:35:34.490
Move! Go away!

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.060
Ms. Chuchu!

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.900
Move aside!

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.466
Ms. Chuchu!

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:37.770
Don't avoid us, Ms. Chuchu!

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.780
(-Ye Nianwen, you heartless vampire.
-How can you still be with her?)

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.360
(Huang Guifen, selling out
your daughter...)

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:41.780
(Ye Ling, you coward.)

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.900
(Alas, girls should really learn
to protect themselves.)

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.300
(Sibei, stay strong! You're amazing!)

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.780
(Believe in yourself.
You're stronger than you think.)

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.980
(Be brave. You can do it.)

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.860
(Certificate of Merit,
Class Star Student)

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.300
(2017, 5th Nancheng
Children's Piano Competition)

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.340
The trial's tomorrow.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.130
Mr. Fan has one request.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.860
He told you

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.610
to polish Wenwen's trophy often.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.580
It gathers dust easily.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.170
Dinner's ready.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.210
What's wrong?

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.170
The trial's tomorrow.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.060
Isn't that a good thing?

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.580
Are you nervous?

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:13.210
I'm a little scared.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.020
Sibei.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.860
We've come this far.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.340
There's nothing left to fear.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.060
Besides, I came across

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.733
the encouraging notes
from those netizens.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.420
With all of them behind you,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.690
it's Fan Jiancheng who should be scared.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.500
But no one's perfect.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.210
What if they find out

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.340
I'm not who they expect me to be?

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.020
They'll curse me too, won't they?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.500
Stop thinking about it.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.180
Let's eat.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.650
Mommy.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.340
Wenwen.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.010
Wenwen.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.860
- Mommy.
- What's it, baby?

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.940
It's getting late.
Why aren't you in bed?

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.340
Why are you crying?

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.980
Why aren't you in bed either?

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.060
I miss Daddy.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.020
I miss Daddy.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.210
Come here, baby.
Mommy will give you a hug.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.170
Hear me out.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.540
Well,

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.090
Daddy...

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.730
Daddy has been framed.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.130
He's innocent.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.420
Mr. Policeman will send him home soon.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.500
So stop crying,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.340
got it?

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.610
But my classmates called Daddy

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.540
a baddie.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.020
They were talking nonsense.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.340
There's no way Daddy's a baddie.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.690
He's a good person.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.290
Daddy has been kind to you,

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:52.170
hasn't he?

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.810
You've never seen Daddy do evil

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:55.980
or talk bad about anyone,

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.820
right?

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.090
I promise.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:00.980
Your dad

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.130
will be home soon.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.210
Let me give you a hug.
