[Episode 5]

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:03.656
Besides all that,

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:09.670
would an average person put up a painting done

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.250
by a woman that he killed right in his office?

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.717
He doesn't care about stuff like that.

00:00:14.717 --> 00:00:16.385
What? You know him?

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.042
We're seeing each other often. What brings you here this time?

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.471
There's something I need to ask you. This is my colleague, Detective Kang Do Chang.

00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:32.278
Hello. I'm Kang Do Chang from Incheon West Violent Crimes Division.

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:34.154
Please have a seat.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
I guess this isn't about personal matters. You brought your colleague with you.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.696
Do you know Yoon Ji Seon, by any chance?

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:53.398
She's a college student who was murdered five years ago. She was an art student.

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:55.110
Yes, I know her.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.471
How did you two know each other?

00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:01.973
She painted my portrait and I asked her to do it.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:07.681
Did you two meet privately while she was working on the portrait?

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:13.546
We had dinner together when she brought the finished portrait. I haven't seen her since then.

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:17.522
It seems like you knew that she was murdered.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.476
- Did you know the killer has already been caught?
- Yes.

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:25.919
Are you curious about why we're asking you about her now?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.009
Why should I be curious about that?

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.266
Detective Kang thinks that you're a suspect.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.884
He thinks you're the one who killed her.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.304
For what reason?

00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:41.295
I told him about you.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:43.632
About me?

00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:45.492
Did you kill her?

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.639
Are you being serious right now?

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.128
Yeah.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.645
I think you need to go.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.417
If you have any questions, you can contact my lawyers.

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:14.255
I have nothing more to say.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.089
Let's go.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.575
Reschedule my lunch plans. I'm going to be free.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.837
What is going on between you two?

00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:38.409
He's my older cousin.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.923
So you think that your cousin...?

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:44.939
I don't want him to be the killer either.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.159
But I can't do anything about it, evidence shows that he did it.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.639
Hold on.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.533
- It seems like you're trying to cover for him.
- Why would I do that?

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:57.806
Why did you ask out of the blue if he had killed her?

00:02:57.806 --> 00:03:01.278
We don't even have evidence or a motive.

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:05.789
Asking him that is telling him that he should brace himself because we're after him.

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.018
That's why I said that.

00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:13.212
Jong Tae has never felt anxious or worried after doing something wrong.

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:16.422
He thinks that no one would dare to go after him.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:19.925
I'm probably the first one who directly asked him if he has killed someone.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:25.852
So, if Oh Jong Tae starts moving because of what you said—

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.009
It means he killed her.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.908
Such a show-off.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.536
The way she looked at me was so beautiful.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.689
Jin Seo Kyeong as the manager?

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.970
Yes. The position is open at the moment.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.918
Is that all right? Is everyone on board with it?

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:07.050
Senior Manager, it's too early.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.571
I don't think the other companies will accept it.

00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.413
They would give her a hard time if she were writing for other regions.

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:16.483
But she works at Jeonghan Daily's headquarters now.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:19.374
No one would dare to get in her way.

00:04:19.374 --> 00:04:23.287
I'm sure she can do it. I believe in her.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.239
Oh, so it was about a month before the crime happened?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.717
How long was the stay? Okay.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.191
Did she say why she was going to New York?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.106
Really? She went alone? Got it.

00:04:45.106 --> 00:04:48.616
Sorry to keep bothering you. Thanks.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.404
What are you working on?

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:54.175
I need to investigate something personal.

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:58.770
Is Kang Do Chang doing something else instead of enjoying his vacation?

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.643
I don't know. I don't pay attention to what others do.

00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:04.070
But he's your partner.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.592
That doesn't make a difference. I like working alone.

00:05:08.592 --> 00:05:10.752
I'll see you later.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.082
Yes, I'm the one who called. Is this Lee Kyeong Oh?

00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:24.146
Were you attacked by Oh Jong Tae recently?

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:29.578
I'm the one who greeted him while it was happening.

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.890
You do remember?

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.397
Yes.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.146
Did you quit your job?

00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:40.655
Yes.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.078
I may not make much, but it's 100 times better than working at that crappy place.

00:05:47.078 --> 00:05:48.869
And I'm more at peace, too.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.312
I should've left a long time ago.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.921
I looked into the department you were working for. What exactly did you do?

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:04.717
Well... We don't really have a specific job description.

00:06:04.717 --> 00:06:08.460
You can just think of everyone

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.660
as Oh Jong Tae's servants.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.893
So you must've been involved in his private matters too.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.868
Jong Tae would frequently date new women, but I think he only met Yoon Ji Seon around the time of the murder.

00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:28.062
And he also didn't go to hostess bars during that time.

00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:29.639
How did they meet?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.693
He met her when she was working a part-time job at a gallery opening,

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:35.373
and I've confirmed that she was working at the gallery.

00:06:35.373 --> 00:06:38.383
And I discovered that the gallery was owned by Jong Tae's friend.

00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:41.718
So they became a couple after that?

00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:45.651
Yoon Ji Seon went to New York six months before her murder.

00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:51.588
I heard she went by herself, but I looked at the flight records, and Jong Tae was on the same flight.

00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:57.227
So they were very close, and he made up for the age difference with his money.

00:06:57.227 --> 00:07:00.238
Did Yoon Ji Seon dump him?

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:03.319
Is that why he killed her?

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.389
Maybe.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.365
Would he kill her because he got dumped? He didn't seem like a total psychopath.

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:13.410
When we were young, Jong Tae had a dog named Happy.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.178
He beat the dog to death because the dog didn't listen to him.

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:19.682
And he placed a picture of him and the dog on his desk.

00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:25.779
He would look at the picture and tell me that he missed Happy.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.202
When he was young, Jong Tae thought that he

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:31.925
could do whatever he wanted at home.

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:35.788
And now he thinks that the outside world is his too.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.771
What are you doing? You said we can't be late!

00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.818
Go ahead first. We'll be right out.

since Kim Gi Tae's first trial is coming up soon.

00:11:57.141 --> 00:12:00.175
Are you telling me to go back to Incheon?

00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:05.186
I'm sure you'll come back to Seoul after the trial.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.828
Alright. I'll take the subway to Incheon again.

00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:15.777
But I want to dig into a different story besides Kim Gi Tae. Is that okay?

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.495
Which story?

00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:19.911
The execution order was announced recently.

00:12:19.911 --> 00:12:24.978
There is someone on the execution list who might be innocent.

00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:27.413
Who?

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.036
Lee Dae Cheol.

00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:31.361
That's crazy! Daebak!

00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:36.038
Senior Manager, if this is true, the Blue House will be in a panic!

00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:38.720
No, not just the Blue House.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.858
It will shake up the whole country.

00:12:41.858 --> 00:12:44.005
- You're confident about this?
- Yes.

00:12:44.005 --> 00:12:46.828
I'm confident I can prove it and handle the consequences.

00:12:46.828 --> 00:12:49.952
Then let's trust her and go with it.

00:12:53.435 --> 00:12:55.135
Go ahead.

00:12:55.135 --> 00:12:56.740
Yes.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.637
Good luck!

00:13:00.637 --> 00:13:03.246
You're welcome to ask for help anytime.

00:13:09.348 --> 00:13:11.149
What if she really does it?

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.475
It will be huge if she really proves Lee Dae Cheol's innocence.

00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:16.035
She won't be able to prove anything without

00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:17.694
the police and the prosecutors' cooperation.

00:13:17.694 --> 00:13:20.289
But they're not crazy.

00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:22.692
They won't help her with a case that will destroy them.

00:13:22.692 --> 00:13:27.455
It will end as a bust.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.596
[Yoo Jeong Seok]

00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:45.308
Yes, Senior Manager.

00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:46.494
Jin Seo Kyeong.

00:13:46.494 --> 00:13:49.636
I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you beforehand.

00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:52.593
I know it won't be good for Congressman Yoo.

00:13:52.593 --> 00:13:56.074
I'm not doing this just to prove myself at the headquarters.

00:13:56.074 --> 00:14:00.369
But... it's my duty as a reporter.

00:14:00.369 --> 00:14:02.988
You don't need to worry about my brother.

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:05.946
Just do your job as a reporter.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.402
Thanks for understanding.

00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:10.952
This will put our company at huge risk.

00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:14.578
I may not be able to protect you.

00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:15.864
You should know that.

00:14:15.864 --> 00:14:19.185
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:39.156
Jo Seong Dae's prints were not on it and there were no traces of blood either.

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:40.880
Thanks.

00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:44.867
Sim Dong Wook. What are you doing?

00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:49.251
It's because Detective Oh asked me.

00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:54.939
So if he asks you to wipe his ass, are you going to wipe his ass?

00:14:54.939 --> 00:15:01.351
You should ask him why and see what it has to do with your work.

00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:05.961
Kwon Jae Hong! You should watch what you say in the office.

00:15:06.474 --> 00:15:09.430
Detective Oh. We're all on the same team.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.907
We need to know what you're working on.

00:15:12.907 --> 00:15:16.291
Why did you arrest Jo Seong Dae?

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:20.355
I arrested him for the murder of Park Geon Ho.

00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:27.647
But I need to let him go since Team 1 proved that it was a suicide.

00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:42.661
Team Leader Woo. Does your team not have anything to do?

00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:44.633
- Do you want me to give you some cases?
- What?

00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:47.016
You need to do a better job managing your team.

00:15:47.016 --> 00:15:51.330
Why are you letting them butt into our cases?

00:15:52.823 --> 00:15:54.728
We wouldn't butt in if you did a good job.

00:15:54.728 --> 00:15:56.532
Cases aren't supposed to be some creative story.

00:15:56.532 --> 00:16:00.603
You guys just wrote your own damn story with it! It's just crazy.

00:16:00.603 --> 00:16:03.101
Hey, Mr. Hairy, watch your mouth.

00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.925
Hey! He's not wrong.

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:09.351
If Park Geon Ho killed himself, everyone who was stabbed also killed themselves.

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:10.670
What the hell are you guys talking about?

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.988
- You little shit.
- Team Leader, don't.

00:16:13.988 --> 00:16:16.552
They're not in their right mind after the audit.

00:16:16.552 --> 00:16:19.678
They've taken a lot of bribery and they're taking their anger out on us.

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:22.370
What did you just say, you bastard?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.990
Stop that, guys.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.810
That's enough!

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.330
What? Let me go!

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.360
Stop it!

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.056
Team Leader Nam.

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:38.170
Don't worry about us.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.262
Worry about your team running their mouths.

00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:44.562
Get back to work, everyone.

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:46.578
Yes, sir.

00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:09.990
I'm curious.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.906
I'm sure you have a lot of excuses for locking me up.

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:17.276
But why are you just letting me go?

00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:19.093
There's no other reason.

00:17:19.093 --> 00:17:21.760
I'm letting you go because you didn't do anything.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.701
Do you know him?
[Kim Gi Tae]

00:17:27.372 --> 00:17:29.251
You dropped this.

00:17:29.251 --> 00:17:31.451
That's not mine.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:34.095
I'll call you if I miss you.

00:17:36.971 --> 00:17:39.329
Oh and...

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:42.968
make sure you relay this to the guy you're serving.

00:17:42.968 --> 00:17:46.759
Tell him I'm sorry we didn't get to chat much last time.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:51.931
Tell him that I want to see him and say what I didn't get to say last time!

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.370
Hello?

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.799
Where are you?

00:18:05.505 --> 00:18:07.005
Okay.

00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:09.298
Oh Jong Tae?

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:13.296
Are you talking about the CEO of Incheon Investment Trust?

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:15.023
Yes, him!

00:18:15.023 --> 00:18:21.418
He's Detective Oh's cousin.

00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:23.892
Seriously?

00:18:23.892 --> 00:18:25.146
Tell me the details.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:32.071
So, Detective Oh thinks that his cousin is the real killer?

00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:34.893
There's a painting in his office and─

00:18:34.893 --> 00:18:38.217
Hey! That's my drink.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.013
Is this how you always get the stories for your articles?

00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:45.812
What did you say?

00:18:45.812 --> 00:18:47.478
Hyeongnim.

00:18:47.478 --> 00:18:49.355
Why do you keep dragging her into our work?

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:52.543
We're all in the same boat.

00:18:52.543 --> 00:18:54.005
Hold on.

00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:56.779
What did you mean by what you just said?

00:18:56.779 --> 00:19:01.554
Did you say I'm a reporter who gets their stories by pouring drinks?

00:19:03.137 --> 00:19:05.162
You piece of trash.

00:19:05.682 --> 00:19:06.985
Reporter Jin!

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:09.337
Hey! Hey!

00:19:09.337 --> 00:19:12.459
Man, you rude little...

00:19:12.978 --> 00:19:14.512
Why did you tell her about Jong Tae?

00:19:14.512 --> 00:19:19.192
Hey! Look around you! Who is going to help us?

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:23.782
She's the only help we can get!

00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:27.317
She's putting her career on the line too. She might change her mind.

00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:30.395
Do you think we have time to test people right now?

00:19:30.395 --> 00:19:32.871
Lee Dae Cheol's execution is coming up soon.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.809
We're not trying to catch the killer.

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:37.301
We're trying to save someone's life!

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.225
Bastard.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.961
Asshole.

00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:48.471
What does he take me for?

00:20:07.003 --> 00:20:11.103
I apologize. I messed up earlier.

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:16.538
It's cold, right?

00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:25.254
Oh Jong Tae asked Yoon Ji Seon to paint his portrait right before she was killed.

00:20:25.254 --> 00:20:30.628
And that portrait is still hanging in his office.

00:20:30.628 --> 00:20:33.638
So there was something going on between them during the time of the murder.

00:20:33.638 --> 00:20:34.343
Yes.

00:20:34.343 --> 00:20:37.199
Then how come he wasn't one of the suspects back then?

00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:40.654
I would like you to find that out for us.

00:20:40.654 --> 00:20:44.418
Don't the police have records from the investigation?

00:20:44.418 --> 00:20:49.715
The one who was in charge of the early part of the investigation is Team Leader Nam.

00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:54.891
Got it. I'll meet with him.

00:20:54.891 --> 00:20:56.531
Do you have family?

00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:58.260
Yes, just my mother.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.304
What about a boyfriend?

00:21:00.972 --> 00:21:02.272
Why?

00:21:02.272 --> 00:21:05.398
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:11.062
I don't think you got involved in this case just for Lee Dae Cheol's sake.

00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:17.649
It's not your fault if Lee Dae Cheol gets executed.

00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:21.800
But it would be your fault if your family or boyfriend gets hurt.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.904
Are you trying to scare me?

00:21:24.904 --> 00:21:27.881
You want me to get scared and leave the case alone.

00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:33.970
Why are you obsessed with this case?

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.170
You don't have a reason to dig into this case.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.767
I don't have family or a girlfriend.

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:43.254
I don't have a boyfriend either. And my mom is in a nursing home.

00:21:43.254 --> 00:21:47.478
And she can't get any worse than she already is.

00:21:47.478 --> 00:21:49.051
Is that enough?

00:21:49.051 --> 00:21:50.842
That's good.

00:21:51.558 --> 00:21:55.488
You think it's good that I don't have a boyfriend at my age and my mom is sick?

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.466
That's too bad then.

00:22:03.216 --> 00:22:07.038
You don't know when a person is supposed to be happy

00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:10.361
and when a person is supposed to be sad, huh?

00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:35.088
I'll give you a call if I get anything after I meet with Team Leader Nam tomorrow.

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:36.505
Here.

00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:39.837
This should help.

00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:44.780
Are you giving this to me for self-defense?

00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:51.363
Thank you so much for worrying about me.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.763
I guess it's better than not having one!

00:23:05.878 --> 00:23:08.370
Sorry about that.

00:23:12.612 --> 00:23:14.137
I've done everything I could.

00:23:14.137 --> 00:23:16.434
You need to have Lee Eun Hye discharged now.

00:23:16.434 --> 00:23:20.313
The thing is, she doesn't have anywhere to go.

00:23:20.313 --> 00:23:22.460
The hospital isn't a hotel.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.403
And we have a lot of people on the list who need to be admitted.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:27.598
What if she faints in the middle of the street—

00:23:27.598 --> 00:23:30.316
She didn't need hospitalization to begin with.

00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:33.598
She'll be able to get back to normal life with her guardian's help.

00:23:33.598 --> 00:23:36.299
She doesn't have a guardian who can help her—

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:37.809
I have nothing else to say to you.

00:23:37.809 --> 00:23:39.987
Have her get discharged tomorrow.

00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:43.596
If you don't, we'll forcibly discharge her right away.

00:23:43.596 --> 00:23:45.114
But she doesn't have a guardian.

00:23:45.114 --> 00:23:46.514
Excuse me.

00:23:46.514 --> 00:23:48.020
Hello?

00:24:18.964 --> 00:24:22.431
How many people do we need to chase after right now?

00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:26.038
Jo Seong Dae, Oh Jong Tae, and

00:24:26.038 --> 00:24:27.159
Nam Gook Hyeon.

00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:29.853
Did you put anyone on Jo Seong Dae?

00:24:29.877 --> 00:24:30.901
No.

00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:34.659
Should we get our team and have them work in secret?

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:37.617
They have a long way to go before retirement.

00:24:37.617 --> 00:24:41.260
There's no need to make things difficult for them.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.154
Is it okay for me because my time will be short?

00:24:43.154 --> 00:24:44.713
Isn't that why you started this?

00:24:44.713 --> 00:24:46.371
You're young too.

00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:49.962
You think the rest of your time as a detective will be smooth sailing?

00:24:49.962 --> 00:24:52.191
I don't care. I'm used to being uncomfortable.

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:58.043
No, it's because you're not afraid since you got your inheritance.

00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:06.463
I'm afraid of something, too.

00:25:07.378 --> 00:25:09.478
Not catching the killer.

00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:14.140
There's a killer I need to find.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.753
Who?

00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:22.044
I don't know.

00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:24.531
And I can't really remember.

00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:27.206
Then how are you going to find the killer?

00:25:27.206 --> 00:25:29.823
I probably won't be able to find him.

00:25:29.823 --> 00:25:31.574
That's why it scares me even more.

00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:36.482
I'm afraid I won't be able to find the killer again.

00:25:36.482 --> 00:25:38.412
What is he talking about?

00:25:40.432 --> 00:25:43.268
One hundred nineteen cameras were installed.

00:25:43.268 --> 00:25:45.216
They will be used for enforcement until next March.

00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:48.974
And 280 cars were caught in just nine hours.

00:25:48.974 --> 00:25:52.928
These cars will have to pay a fine of 250,000 Won (~$250).

Hey.

00:25:59.214 --> 00:26:03.130
- I told you to take the sheets out of the washing machine and dry them.
- Aigoo.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.820
Hanging them in the middle of the night won't make them dry!

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:09.241
It can be done in the morning.

00:26:09.241 --> 00:26:12.284
I don't know why you're hassling me all of a sudden.

00:26:12.284 --> 00:26:14.808
We're not in a position to take anyone in.

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:16.840
Just do as I say,

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.956
before I kick you out.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.993
She must be going deaf from drinking too much.

Men of sturdy build are going around

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:30.193
bowing low, and threatening other gangsters who are on their knees.

00:26:30.193 --> 00:26:33.975
The gangs of Incheon and Gwangju had a violent

00:26:33.975 --> 00:26:37.520
fight in the middle of the streets of Gwangju.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:43.406
The police believe the Incheon gang went to Gwangju to retaliate,

00:26:43.406 --> 00:26:48.266
and they are trying to find the members who are on the run.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.359
Did you see who stabbed your father?

00:27:55.128 --> 00:27:56.995
Do you remember his face?

00:28:01.144 --> 00:28:03.310
Think about it carefully.

You're the only one who saw him.

You don't know when a person is supposed to be happy

00:28:57.618 --> 00:29:00.770
and when a person is supposed to be sad, huh?

- Joo Dong Pal from Yeonan Gang?
- Yes, sir.

He's the boss of the Yeonan Gang who caused a scene in Gwangju yesterday.

00:30:06.434 --> 00:30:11.198
We'll get Joo Dong Pal and all of the members this time.

00:30:11.198 --> 00:30:13.503
They're not going to be caught that easily.

00:30:13.503 --> 00:30:16.581
I'm sure they've already gone into hiding.

Yes, come in!

Come in.

Shouldn't you be on vacation?

00:30:23.942 --> 00:30:28.662
Team Leader, I can't believe you called in someone who's supposed to be on vacation.

00:30:28.662 --> 00:30:32.733
Hey, it happened in Gwangju, but it's our gang.

00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:37.814
Our division will get all the backlash if we don't catch them.

00:30:37.814 --> 00:30:40.500
You're the only one who can catch Joo Dong Pal.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.375
You... do you know him well?

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:46.211
I've been managing him since he was a kid.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.610
But I'm supposed to be on vacation. Why me?

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.194
Chief, Gwangju requested help just now.

00:30:53.194 --> 00:30:57.327
If they catch Joo Dong Pal before we do, we'll be ruined!

00:30:57.327 --> 00:30:59.934
Joo Dong Pal is under our jurisdiction!

00:30:59.934 --> 00:31:03.243
Shouldn't Gwangju hand him over to us even if they catch him?

00:31:03.243 --> 00:31:04.954
No one cares about that these days!

00:31:04.954 --> 00:31:07.648
The one who cuffs the criminal first gets to keep him.

00:31:07.648 --> 00:31:11.778
Gwangju has already issued an arrest warrant.

00:31:11.778 --> 00:31:13.847

Joo Dong Pal is our fish that we kept in our fish tank!

00:31:19.688 --> 00:31:22.459
Are you going to let Gwangju just take all the fish from us?

00:31:22.459 --> 00:31:24.759
Of course not.

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:27.991

with my high school friends. I can't just cancel—

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:35.357
Cancel it.

00:31:35.357 --> 00:31:36.975
The cancellation fee isn't that much.

00:31:36.975 --> 00:31:38.742
But it will be at least 150,000 Won (~$150) to 200,000 Won (~$200).

00:31:38.742 --> 00:31:41.053
He'll pay it for you.

00:37:19.703 --> 00:37:22.076
I guess he can't remember.

00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:26.157
I'm sure he'll remember him once we talk.

00:37:26.157 --> 00:37:28.072
Don't worry, Chief. Let's go.

00:37:28.072 --> 00:37:30.059
I really don't know who that is!

00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:35.491
It's fine, we'll put down that you don't know him.

00:37:36.486 --> 00:37:38.919
Come on, you know how this goes.

00:37:41.684 --> 00:37:47.763
Kang Do Chang is the best at handling guys like him.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.742
He has four counts of assault.

00:37:57.742 --> 00:38:02.425
That's enough to be one of Yeonan's gang members, right?

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:04.597
What are you talking about?

00:38:04.597 --> 00:38:07.825
It means your charge can be elevated to organized crime

00:38:07.825 --> 00:38:10.035
according to the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes.

00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:14.563
You'll have to serve about two to three times the sentence you've served so far.

00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:16.035
On what basis?

00:38:16.035 --> 00:38:18.093
We just need to catch Joo Dong Pal and have you

00:38:18.093 --> 00:38:19.950
stand next to him and take a few pictures.

00:38:19.995 --> 00:38:24.229
The judge won't think it's weird after he sees your record. Right?

00:38:24.229 --> 00:38:25.857
What do you want from me?

00:38:25.857 --> 00:38:29.175
You need to prove to us that you're working under Jo Seong Dae.

00:38:29.175 --> 00:38:31.442
Then your charges will be dropped.

00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:36.211
I just manage the office for him.

00:38:36.211 --> 00:38:38.631
I don't really know what he does.

00:38:38.631 --> 00:38:41.288
So you're admitting that you work under Jo Seong Dae?

00:38:41.288 --> 00:38:44.752
You said you would let me go if I do!

00:38:44.752 --> 00:38:48.863
Jo Seong Dae killed Park Geon Ho.

00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:51.809
When we prove it, you'll get charged with the same crime.

00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:53.703
Damn it.

00:38:53.703 --> 00:38:56.310
I don't even know who Park Geon Ho is!

00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:01.005
I don't even know who my boss meets with! I really don't know anything!

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:06.422
All I did was bring him the people he wanted to see!

00:39:06.422 --> 00:39:09.858
So who did he ask you to go get?

00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:12.436
Park Geon Ho?

00:39:13.144 --> 00:39:14.231
Not him.

00:39:14.255 --> 00:39:16.356
Did Jo Seong Dae kill that person too?

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.680
No.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.730
That person left alive.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.789
I'm sure about that.

00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:23.528
Really? That's good. So you can tell us who it was.

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:25.318
Who was it?

00:39:29.503 --> 00:39:35.236
[December 7, 2018]

00:39:35.976 --> 00:39:38.058
Go Joon Seop.

00:39:39.403 --> 00:39:41.403
We need to talk in private.

00:39:41.403 --> 00:39:43.292
You guys can wait outside.

00:39:43.316 --> 00:39:44.716
Yes, sir.

00:39:47.504 --> 00:39:49.005
Don't worry.

00:39:49.005 --> 00:39:51.381
We're just going to talk.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.323
Shall we talk now?

00:40:43.323 --> 00:40:45.282
One more round?

00:40:45.282 --> 00:40:48.989
Hyeongnim, what if we get hurt too?

00:40:54.996 --> 00:40:57.050
Our talk went well.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.164
Escort him home.

00:40:59.164 --> 00:41:00.745
Yes, sir.

00:41:09.772 --> 00:41:10.872
Mr. Go Joon Seop?

00:41:10.872 --> 00:41:11.971
Yes?

00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:13.445
I'm Go Joon Seop.

00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:15.045
How can I help you?

00:41:15.045 --> 00:41:17.140
We're from the Incheon West Police Department.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.334
The police?

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:24.568
Is there anywhere we can talk?

00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:26.527
Please follow me.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.390
What is going on?

00:41:39.883 --> 00:41:41.773
You majored in art?

00:41:41.773 --> 00:41:42.975
Yes.

00:41:42.975 --> 00:41:44.664
Which college did you go to?

00:41:44.664 --> 00:41:46.760
I majored in Western Arts at Seongmoon University.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.066
So Yoon Ji Seon, the one who was killed five years ago—

00:41:49.066 --> 00:41:50.673
She was in my class.

00:41:50.673 --> 00:41:53.096
- Then—
- That's all.

00:41:53.096 --> 00:41:55.929
Of course, we knew each other since we were in the same class,

00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:59.866
but I have nothing else to say regarding her and me.

00:41:59.866 --> 00:42:01.022
Is that all?

00:42:01.022 --> 00:42:04.256
I have a presentation today, so I'm quite busy.

00:42:04.256 --> 00:42:06.193
I apologize.

00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:08.982
I think you'll have a lot to say about this man.

00:42:08.982 --> 00:42:10.106
No.

00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:11.195
I have nothing to say.

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.919
No way.

00:42:13.417 --> 00:42:16.718
This guy's face probably haunts you every night.

00:42:16.718 --> 00:42:20.354
And that dirty memory will keep torturing you throughout the nights.

00:42:20.354 --> 00:42:23.011
You'll have to live the rest of your life as the incompetent man

00:42:23.011 --> 00:42:25.549
who didn't call the police because you were too scared.

00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:28.906
We're going to make him pay for what he did.

00:42:28.906 --> 00:42:31.195
What does Jo Seong Dae want from you?

00:42:31.195 --> 00:42:33.680
What did you two talk about?

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.038
Jo Seong Dae kills people without batting an eye.

00:42:37.038 --> 00:42:42.207
Why did he let you walk away?

00:42:42.207 --> 00:42:45.203
It's because he knew you had a reason not to call the police.

00:42:45.203 --> 00:42:48.303
Is there something you're trying to hide?

00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:51.826
I guess this won't work.

00:42:51.826 --> 00:42:54.693
We'll be back with an arrest warrant.

00:42:56.359 --> 00:42:58.059
Wait.

00:43:00.723 --> 00:43:05.944
He thought that I killed Ji Seon.

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:09.744
He asked me why I killed Ji Seon.

00:43:09.744 --> 00:43:11.772
Why would Jo Seong Dae think that?

00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:16.273
Because I was Ji Seon's boyfriend.

00:43:17.404 --> 00:43:20.247
But I didn't kill her!

00:43:21.644 --> 00:43:25.165
[November 1, 2015]

00:43:25.189 --> 00:43:27.452
This was in there.

00:43:28.051 --> 00:43:30.952
- That's...
- Is it his?

00:43:30.952 --> 00:43:31.913
Who?

00:43:31.937 --> 00:43:36.594
Did you know that I was waiting for you at the airport when you arrived from New York?

00:43:36.594 --> 00:43:38.953
You came out with some guy.

00:43:38.953 --> 00:43:41.883
Did you go to New York with him?

00:43:43.004 --> 00:43:45.471
He looked super rich.

00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:49.893
I'm sure he's loaded if he can take you to New York.

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:52.887
I didn't know you were such a materialistic person.

00:43:56.244 --> 00:43:58.069
Please don't go.

00:43:58.069 --> 00:44:01.802
I have no feelings for him.

00:44:01.802 --> 00:44:04.776
He said he would support me for no other special reason.

00:44:04.776 --> 00:44:06.824
That's why I went with him.

00:44:06.824 --> 00:44:10.940
So nothing happened in New York?

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:16.849
I saw who he really was when we went there.

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:19.277
But I refused him until the end!

00:44:19.277 --> 00:44:22.155
What the hell did he do to you?

00:44:22.155 --> 00:44:23.871
Tell me.

00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:25.938
Tell me!

00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:27.406
What did he do?

00:44:27.406 --> 00:44:28.830
Please.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.005
I'll make sure to end it.

00:44:31.005 --> 00:44:32.329
End what?

00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:33.770
You said nothing happened.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.270
It really nothing happened.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.543
Please trust me.

00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:43.657
So let me take care of it. I'll end it no matter what.

00:44:46.788 --> 00:44:52.818
You're the only one I love. There is no one else.

00:44:54.139 --> 00:44:55.973
I love you.

00:44:56.981 --> 00:45:00.784
That was the last time I saw her.

00:45:00.784 --> 00:45:03.082
And two days later...

00:45:03.946 --> 00:45:06.766
she was found dead.

00:45:06.766 --> 00:45:11.008
Is this the watch that was found in the studio?

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.826
Yes, they look similar.

00:45:16.978 --> 00:45:21.612
The man who was with her at the airport...

00:45:23.871 --> 00:45:26.361
Yes, that's him.

00:45:29.903 --> 00:45:32.049
Why didn't you tell the police?

00:45:32.049 --> 00:45:35.966
Things wouldn't be so messed up if you had told the police!

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:38.522
I thought she was your girlfriend. Aren't you mad?

00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:40.398
Don't you feel sorry for her?

00:45:40.398 --> 00:45:44.889
The police would've suspected me if I had told them.

00:45:44.889 --> 00:45:49.713
If he got acquitted, then I would have been the only one left.

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:54.461
I'm the only one who had the motive to kill Ji Seon.

00:45:54.461 --> 00:45:58.269
That's the only reason you kept it a secret until now?

00:45:59.983 --> 00:46:01.953
Where is your conscience?

00:46:01.953 --> 00:46:05.786
If the police had come to me, I would've told them.

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:10.861
But no one... no one came to me.

00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:13.903
I want to go find the detective who was in charge of the case and ask him.

00:46:13.903 --> 00:46:16.334
Why didn't they come find me?

00:46:16.334 --> 00:46:19.017
How did someone else become the suspect instead of that bastard

00:46:19.017 --> 00:46:21.849
who kept following Ji Seon?

00:46:25.233 --> 00:46:30.938
The one who I think of every night isn't the guy who beat me up.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:38.299
It's Ji Seon's face when she last told me... that she loved me.

00:46:43.382 --> 00:46:44.482
Ah, got it.

00:46:44.482 --> 00:46:46.032
I'll see you there.

00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:47.565
Okay.

00:46:53.169 --> 00:46:54.569
Hyeongnim.

00:46:56.062 --> 00:46:58.262
Reporter Jin wants to see me.

00:46:58.262 --> 00:46:59.278
Okay.

00:46:59.278 --> 00:47:02.358
I need to go to the hospital. I need to get Eun Hye discharged.

00:47:02.358 --> 00:47:04.134
Do you want to take my car then?

00:47:04.134 --> 00:47:07.187
No, it's not that far. I'll take a cab.

00:47:07.187 --> 00:47:10.042
Call me. I'm going to join you as soon as I get her discharged.

00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:11.542
Got it.

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:17.455
Hyeongnim!

00:47:18.638 --> 00:47:20.292
We don't have time.

00:47:20.292 --> 00:47:22.554
Don't waste your energy on unnecessary things.

00:47:22.554 --> 00:47:24.983
I know.

00:47:43.335 --> 00:47:45.035
No, I'm okay, sir.

00:47:45.035 --> 00:47:46.259
Take it.

00:47:46.259 --> 00:47:48.104
Get a bottle of soju.

00:47:48.104 --> 00:47:52.265
Don't feel bad, it's from the investigation budget.

00:47:52.265 --> 00:47:53.829
Okay. Thank you, sir.

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:56.171
Take care, sir.

00:48:09.211 --> 00:48:11.236
Are you ready?

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:16.077
I heard the doctor gave you a prescription. Is that it?

00:48:18.688 --> 00:48:21.769
Let's stop by the pharmacy and get the meds.

00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:24.963
Where are we going? I'm not going to go to a shelter.

00:48:24.963 --> 00:48:27.196
We're not going to a shelter.

00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.037
We're going home.

00:48:29.745 --> 00:48:31.329
My home.

00:48:32.483 --> 00:48:33.983
Let's go.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.370
Ahjussi.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.876
Why are you doing this?

00:48:46.652 --> 00:48:49.538
What do you mean? What am I doing?

00:48:49.538 --> 00:48:54.847
You're the one... who arrested my dad.

00:48:55.895 --> 00:48:58.820
You're the one who made my dad become a death row inmate.

00:49:00.095 --> 00:49:03.574
Do you think I can like you?

00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:08.180
Of course, you should hate me.

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:11.820
You should keep hating me. That's easier.

00:49:20.487 --> 00:49:22.729
This is the hallway of the Haeseong Hotel in Busan.

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.854
And...

00:49:39.992 --> 00:49:42.816
Oh Jong Tae leaves around 9:00 (9:00am).

00:49:43.508 --> 00:49:47.902
Oh Jong Tae was excluded from the list of suspects because of this footage.

00:50:05.133 --> 00:50:07.850
You should've told me that you were coming.

What? Where did she go?

00:50:22.484 --> 00:50:25.470
She said she was going to get a change of underwear.

00:50:57.526 --> 00:51:01.968
Do we need to change the direction of this investigation?

00:51:01.968 --> 00:51:04.589
I think we need to consider Go Joon Seop as the suspect

00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:08.086
and proceed with the investigation.

00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:09.804
You saw Go Joon Seop.

00:51:09.804 --> 00:51:11.937
Did he look like the killer to you?

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.402
No, it's not him.

Well, he's under our jurisdiction.

Someone has to catch him.

- Yes.

What is that bastard talking about?

00:52:02.865 --> 00:52:08.633
I'm sure Jo Seong Dae learned about Oh Jong Tae from Go Joon Seop.

00:52:08.633 --> 00:52:12.635
But Jo Seong Dae killed Park Geon Ho for Oh Jong Tae.

00:52:12.635 --> 00:52:16.693
Jo Seong Dae probably blackmailed Oh Jong Tae, saying that he was the killer.

00:52:16.693 --> 00:52:18.357
And Oh Jong Tae paid to shut him up.

00:52:18.357 --> 00:52:22.057
After getting a taste of money, Jo Seong Dae went to work for Oh Jong Tae.

00:52:22.057 --> 00:52:23.364
It's obvious.

00:52:23.364 --> 00:52:28.273
There's a good chance that Detective Nam got a taste of that money too.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.733

I was thinking the same thing.

00:52:58.882 --> 00:53:02.252

If you find something and give it to another reporter, I'll look like an asshole.

00:53:14.748 --> 00:53:16.922
