My Hui Joo...

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.510
please be generous and forgive her.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.760
Hui Joo must also be asking for your forgiveness on the other side.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.040
Director Cheon, what would you like me to do for tea?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.430
I'll do it myself. He's a precious guest.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.520
Are you okay with coffee?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.550
Yes.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.640
Give me one moment.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.900
That's okay, please continue, Director Cheon.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.260
Okay. I'll be there soon.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.600
Oh my, Hui Joo.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.830
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.300
Did something happen?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.900
Director Cheon.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.600
Yes?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.930
Are you Director Cheon?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.700
That's what they usually call me.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.350
Did Hui Joo call you that too?

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.210
Yes.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.910
Why are you asking that suddenly?

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.430
Oh, yes.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.100
I suddenly remembered

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300
Hui Joo saying your name over the phone.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.590
Oh, now that I think about it,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.750
I remember talking to her on the phone.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.600
Ms. Jeong Hui Joo submitted a resignation letter to the company.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.120
I wanted to ask her to stay, so I asked to meet with her.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.960
I didn't want to lose a capable company employee just because of a personal reason.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.390
I see. Is that so?

Do you remember the guy who stole cash after assaulting the owner of Cheonma-dong Billiards yesterday?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.040
Okay.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.150
Did you find the weapon?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.000
It's right here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240
Excuse me, but it's not that.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.750
Hey!

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.820
You were filmed on a security camera hitting the owner in the back of the head with a pool ball!

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.180
That's a regular pool ball,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.060
and the one I used is a pocket ball.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.160
They're the same thing, damn it.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.860
It's different. A pocket ball is much smaller.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.830
Stop. Do your job correctly.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.380

Yes.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.060
Do Chang, what did the prosecutor say? Did he say Cheon Sang Woo's team is appealing?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.360
Isn't it obvious?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Hey, if things go the other way on the second trial, won't we be the only ones ruined?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.220
Didn't you hear what the chief said? He told us to forget about it.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.580
How are we supposed to? If Cheon Sang Woo gets out of this, we're all dead!

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.240
They shouldn't have said "violent crimes team"!

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.800
They should've clearly stated that it was Division Team 2!

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.110
Which news outlet wrote that?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.280

I guess after dealing with a conglomerate chairman,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.050
they can't see the guy who hit a person with a pool ball as a real culprit.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.690
I mean, why are they treating them so differently?

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.540
A conglomerate chairman, or a thief, they're the same.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.010
They're different. Their class, you know?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.340
From my point of view, they're the same. One person got six numbers right, and the other got five.

Is that okay? She's a mother of a child.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.890
What's wrong with being a mother of a child? If she's alone, she can date.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.950
Wow. That's a nice car. He must have a lot of money.

I'm not planning on taking charge for a while.

You should go somewhere and take a break.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.210
You've had such a hard time.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.180
Well, I don't think I need to do that.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.990
I'm just going to watch how things go.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.720
What about you?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.670
I don't know what to do.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.790
What should I do with you?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.710
Sang Woo keeps blaming you.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.850
He believes you made the situation like this.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.730
I didn't do anything good, but

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.140
I also didn't do anything wrong.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.240
It's what he brought on himself.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.330
It's something he has to handle and take responsibility for on his own.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.860
Do you think I don't know what you did?

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.290
D-D-Dad.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.640
- I-I...
- Na Na, aren't you supposed to be thankful to me?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.540
I accepted you as a daughter.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.900
Then you should just accept what I tell you to have.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.820
The moment you covet something else, you lose the right to be my daughter.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.600
Become small. Bring yourself down to the bottom, and become small.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.840
That's the only way for you to remain my daughter.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.000
I kept trying to call him, but he won't talk, and now he won't even answer the phone.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.980
That makes sense.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.680
He was the most old-fashioned guy among my colleagues.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.060
He's probably avoiding talking, in case it causes harm to the other detectives.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.500
Right after Woo Tae Ho's accident, he was transferred out of the traffic crimes unit

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.050
and sent to the countryside.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.340
I'm sure there's a reason.

Well.

There's no reason for Eun Hui not to date a guy.

I can't really say anything about that.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.930
That's right.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.750
However, when I looked up his car, it wasn't registered under his name.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.250
That girl. She's so bad at choosing men.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.100
We should investigate.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.870
If we leave it alone, she might get into trouble.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.600
Hello.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.970
Did you meet with him?

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.350
Yes, I met him and heard the story.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.800
What did he say?

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.760
Woo Tae Ho didn't kill himself.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.500
What is it that you want to tell me?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.770
What is this looming feeling telling me this won't be a hopeful talk?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.950
Well, today, Oh Ji Hyeok and Sim Dong Wook went and met with a police officer.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.320
Someone called Kim Chang Seo.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.590
He was responsible for the investigation into Woo Tae Ho's death,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:09:00.670
and he was in the traffic crimes investigation department. Now, he's in a countryside station after being kicked out.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.810
You're opening the investigation into Woo Tae Ho's death again?

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.910
Oh boy!

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.300
Why are my premonitions never wrong? So?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.540
Hey Sim Dong Wook, tell him exactly what your friend said.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.020
Okay. At the time of Woo Tae Ho's investigation, there was an assessment of the car that was in the accident.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.670
There were two fingerprints found in the car, one from the deceased Woo Tae Ho, and one from passenger Cheon Na Na.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.270
Isn't that obvious? What's wrong with that?

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.910
Cheon Na Na's fingerprints were found on both the driver's-side seat belt buckle and the steering wheel.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.930
Woo Tae Ho was driving at the time of the accident.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.280
Hey, the married couple could've been taking turns driving. What's wrong with that? Huh?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.980
At the time of the accident, Cheon Na Na had been drinking.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.600
This was confirmed at the hospital where Cheon Na Na was admitted to. She wasn't in a state to drive.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.160
Just something like that wouldn't make this a piece of evidence that would flip this case over.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.860
This is the best way.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.570
Please follow my lead this time.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.960
I'll take care of everything.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.100
I'm sorry.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.160
I can't trust you.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.930
You heard that click in the middle, right? It's the sound of the seat belt being released.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.220
Cheon Na Na testified that Woo Tae Ho undid the seat belt himself.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.620
If Cheon Na Na's fingerprints were found on that switch, it means Cheon Na Na undid it.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.430
Then, Cheon Na Na grabbed the wheel and changed direction toward the oncoming truck on the other side.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.130
That's why Cheon Na Na's fingerprints were found on the steering wheel.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.190
Hey, that's because Oh Ji Hyeok, you

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.720
are thinking that Cheon Na Na killed Woo Tae Ho,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.140
and because of that thinking, it causes you to try and shove the pieces together.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.770
You're the only one thinking that!

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.270
It wasn't just Detective Oh who was thinking that.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.330
My friend also had the same suspicions as Detective Oh.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.490
So he raised that question to the traffic crimes unit, and that's why he was kicked out.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.260
There must have been pressure from the outside to hide it.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.440
However, because he brought up something he shouldn't have, they sent him away.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.740
Don't you think this is a pretty common scenario?

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.760
So, what's your conclusion?

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:08.420
You've put the great TJ Group's chairman in prison with charges of abetting murder,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.500
and now, you're suggesting that you won't be satisfied

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.990
until TJ Group's daughter, Cheon Na Na, also gets put away for murdering her husband,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.620
- is it that?
- Yes.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.830
Hey guys, Chairman Cheon Seong Dae was released.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.350
You send his precious son to a cold prison cell,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.590
and now, his only remaining child, his daughter,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.440
you want that single daughter Cheon Na Na to be arrested as her husband's killer?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.570
Do you think he would leave us alone?

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.520
His net worth is over several trillion won (billions of dollars).

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.720
Even if he put 10 billion won (~$10M) on each of your heads, it wouldn't leave a scratch on his net worth.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.780
Do you still want to do this?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.010
[The safest West Coast]

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.370
Okay.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.700
Then,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.540
let's decide by majority.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.310
Even with your life on the line,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.720
anyone who thinks we need reinvestigation into Cheon Na Na,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.230
raise your hand.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.030
One, two, three.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.500
There are eight people in this room, so—

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000
Why are you suddenly...?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.690
Dong Wook investigated this.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.590
I'm his superior, and as a superior, this feels a bit embarrassing.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.380
Okay. Okay. Including that, four.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.810
Why are you raising your hand now?

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.600
I'm the team leader, and from what I heard,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.540
it doesn't seem to be too farfetched, possibly, maybe.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.130
That's five.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.430
- It's over half.
- However,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.780
for this important issue,

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.470
we should decide not by more than half,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.590
but more than two-thirds of the room— Now, why are you doing this?

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.540
I, well, really don't like the number five.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.950
One, two, three, four, five, six. I think it's perfect.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.230
Okay then, me too.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.390
Put it down. Six is enough.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.730
Bonus number.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.950
Adds up to seven.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.930
My gosh!

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:15.280
Even if the chief gave us permission, it's not a case where all of us should be getting involved yet.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.060
If we start a baseless full-scale investigation,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.240
it might come back at us, like the chief said.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.090
Okay. I'll look for more clues first.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.440
I think it's best if we make a move together then.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.410
Everyone's doing this with trust in you.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.250
If things seem hopeless, give up quickly.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.080
That would be the best choice for the sake of our team.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.800
Okay. Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.170
What?

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.130
Yes, Hyeongnim, the guy with the unregistered car

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.060
we told you about earlier, is inside the restaurant right now.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.780
What?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.640
- Yes?
- Come meet me.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.220
I have a favor to ask.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.490
Where are you?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.320
You have to make time for me tomorrow, okay?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.050
Okay, well, even if I have to close the restaurant, I'll be there.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.860
I'll enjoy this chicken, thank you.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.770
Yes, please do.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.870
Wait. I forgot something.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.180
Th-Th-That bastard.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.830
Just wait a bit.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.330
We have to catch him with the car.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.590
Should we follow him?

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.580
He probably parked the car over there somewhere.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.030
Let's check it out. A license plate under another name doesn't make him a criminal.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.790
That's right. He might have brought a friend's car to show off.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.330
Right.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.800
Please let it just be that.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.000
Please.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.850
That silly girl. Look how silly she looks.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.940
Aigoo. Excuse me.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.210
Are you the owner of this car?

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.870
Yes. This is my car.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.970
We're from the West Incheon—

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.010
Hey!

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:01.050
Why did you run? Why did you have to run, you bastard?

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.100
What kind of crime did you commit that you would run? Huh?

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.930
Can't you just live nicely?

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.490
Ah, really. Why? Why?

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.860
Why, of all people, did it have to be someone like you?

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.610
Why? Why?

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.170
Who are you?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.100
I'm Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Violent Crimes Team.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.400
Yes, I heard about your arrival. Come on in. Open the door for him.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.840
Take a seat. Over there.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.380
What kind of favor did you want to ask for?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.600
Protect me.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.610
I'm asking you to quit being a detective and protect me.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.960
Tell me any conditions you might have. I'll say yes to everything.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.040
I'm sorry. That isn't a favor I can do for you.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.780
This is the only time you'll get this proposition. I won't ask again.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.480
I told you it's an unreasonable request.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.350
Then you'll become an enemy to me,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:28.250
because you know the reason why I might die.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.580
If my father finds out what I did to my brother, Dad will kill me.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.870
The things you and I,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.780
only the two of us know about.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.230
I'll make a promise.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.530
I won't do anything that would harm you.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.630
Then you shouldn't have refused my proposal.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.100
Well, that's too bad.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.220
If you can't trust me, I'm your enemy, just like you said.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.410
Then that clears up our relationship. What a shame.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:11.440
I thought of you as an only friend, someone who has the same past as I do.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.100
Your mother died because of you.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.810
My mother killed herself because of me, too.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:27.940
We're both murderers. Murderers who killed their mother.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.930
Do you really

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.300
believe that your mother died because of you,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.320
and that you aren't using that to fill your own desires?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.040
Your mother, Yoon Ji Sook,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.180
was preparing for a lawsuit against Chairman Cheon Seong Dae at the time.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.020
It was a lawsuit to register you as his legal daughter.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.430
Cheon Seong Dae and Cheon Sang Woo thought she was after money and started pressuring your mother.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.590
That was your mother's reason for committing suicide.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:07.380
It was because of me. She died to save me.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.670
She sent me to America, and to save me, she sacrificed herself.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.620
You were at the scene of her suicide too.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.340
You let it happen.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.950
To be accepted as the daughter of Cheon Seong Dae, you thought of your mother as an obstacle.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.680
At the time, I was on an airplane to America.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.000
That's a past that you manipulated.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.040
A manipulated past to hide your desires.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.060
No.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:41.090
My dad and brother spilled to the media like that to cover up their own sins.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:51.440
Do you... truly believe the past that you manipulated

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.850
is reality?

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:03.770
Detective Oh Ji Hyeok, please leave now.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.880
Now I know what you think of me, so leave right now.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.610
Keep in mind.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.170
You started strangling me first.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.900
Keep in mind.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.390
You started strangling me first.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.250
"You started strangling me first."

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.010
So?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.800
So, that's why.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.220
Open the door.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.740
Stop playing tricks and open the door!

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.140
I know what you're thinking.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.740
I know that you're only doing this for money!

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.650
I won't let that happen.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.450
I won't! Give up and open the door!

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.640
Open it!

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.280
Mom.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.500
Na Na,

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.730
do you want to go with Mom?

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.280
Do you?

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.670
I wasn't here.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.050
I wasn't here.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.470
I wasn't here...

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.850
You have five stars (previous convictions). Five!

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.210
I've washed my hands of things.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.340
I've turned my life around and started a business.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.300
Then why are you driving an unregistered car?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.680
That's... I bought it, so I can save a bit on tax.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.190
Then why did you run away?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.110
This guy is a car insurance scammer.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.230
Driving an unregistered car, you were probably planning to scam someone.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.500
I bet I'm right.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.180
Did you perhaps know that I was a detective and purposefully got close to my sister?

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.950
Do you think I'm crazy?

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.770
I was just freaking unlucky.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.010
What, you bastard? Unlucky, huh?

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.310
It's okay. It's okay. If he didn't know, then it's fine.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.040
It would be best if you don't see my sister from now on.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.980
If she finds out you're a bad guy,

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.650
she'll be the one breaking your neck, not me.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.320
She's a national judo competition gold medalist.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.410
Someone like you would be spinning in the air on one hand. Get it?

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.470
Is that so?

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.930
I didn't know.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.320
She looked really delicate.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.850
So, Eun Hui looks delicate to you?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.650
Yes. Honestly, I had no other intentions.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.450
She looked lonely, so

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.460
I just wanted to console her.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.300
Hey, look a bit deeper into this guy.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.320
Let's also use this opportunity to get the business with the unregistered car connected to this guy.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.340
- Okay.
- I'm going to go.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.810
Okay, take care.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.480
Take care.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.140
Where did you get the unregistered car?

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.470
You didn't steal the car and register it under a different name, did you?

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.410
I really don't know.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.840
I bought it online.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.970
Hey, do you want me to personally investigate? Do you want me to make you talk?

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.940
N-No.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.670
I'll say it.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.000
Did you eat?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.170
I didn't feel like it.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.100
What have you been doing until now without eating?

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.660
I brought some leftover chicken. Do you at least want that?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.810
That guy.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.280
I arrested him today.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.710
Who?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.150
The guy you were dating.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.910
The guy who kissed your forehead.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.940
Why?

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.010
He's a scammer who drives an unregistered car.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.490
Can't you look into a person before dating them?

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.890
Why do you always date guys like that?

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.430
Did you thoroughly look into it?

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.900
He has five previous convictions.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.690
Bastard.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.600
It's not that I don't understand you, but don't you think it's a bit soon?

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.410
Your divorce wasn't too long ago.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.990
I did it because I was lonely. Lonely, okay?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.550
What, am I not allowed to be lonely?

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.440
Do I

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.410
have to go through life just taking care of you?

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.070
Who asked you to take care of me?

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.700
So, Oppa, please find someone.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.710
Let me live my life too.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.180
We two, who live like this.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.670
Don't you think we're pathetic?

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.240
Uncle, welcome back.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.580
My Jae Woong, you weren't asleep?

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.060
Mom, why are you drinking again?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.000
You were playing games in the bathroom again, right?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.690
Did I, or did I not tell you to only play an hour a day!

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.930
Why are you taking it out on him?

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.370
Let's go out. I'll buy you something tasty.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.930
Jae Woong is my son. Why is the uncle getting in the middle of it?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.640
You just do what you need to do!

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.310
Stop trying to take care of everything! Please!

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.480
Let's go. Your mom is not in a good mood today.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.900
And stop playing games your mom said to play for only an hour.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.890
Jae Woong,

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.500
is it uncomfortable to live with me?

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.090
I'm fine, but...

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.600
But...?

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.310
Mom says she feels bad for you.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.480
She said that you wouldn't be able to marry because of us.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.900
Why wouldn't I?

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.500
I'm very popular with women.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.230
I'm not getting married, but it's not like I can't.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.230
But then,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:52.630
Mom says you will get older and uglier.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.600
And...

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.390
Mom too.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.160
Right. I didn't think of that.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.130
It's because I'm stupid.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.880
What is it?

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.610
- License plate, 132 Neu 1193.
- It's me.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.260
- Can you check the car, please?
- There's a car

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.780
in front of the door.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.980
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah, come on out quickly.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.400
This car was reported as stolen yesterday.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.970
Hey, Oh Ji Hyeok,

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.540
check how many there are.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.870
Okay.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.860
Is this not your car?

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.750
Aigoo. I'm sorry!

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.120
- Is this your car?
- Yes.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.260
- Move it.
- I had to pee really bad.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.100
Okay.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.420
Okay.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.820
What are you doing? Move the car.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.870
What are you doing?

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.590
Hyeongnim!

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.780
Check inside.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.370
Why? What is it?

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.990
What?

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.250
I was searching for traces of erasing the original VIN,

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.490
and there was something strange in there.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.600
Isn't this a tracker?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.430
Yes. It's a GPS tracker.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.850
Oh, yeah. I drank too much yesterday.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.280
Yeah.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.070
No.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.030
Everything good?

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.760
Yeah?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.950
Send that to a different team.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.020
Yeah, I'll go in and personally tell the team leader.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.730
Okay.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.720
[Trunk Open]

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.680
Some of the account holders of the borrowed name accounts have been persuaded.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.770
I just directly sent the money that was collected.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.750
You said you'd send it to the bank account.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.210
There's a high possibility for the bank account to be exposed.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.700
Isn't it safer for it to be dispersed?

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.150
The money being put into the trunk was probably filmed.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.180
If that gets revealed,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.580
it would be evidence against me, and I'd be blamed for accepting bribery.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.030
Oh. It was on purpose?

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.070
Has Team Leader Choi Yong Geun informed you

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.370
what kind of deal we had?

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.910
Well, no. I just trust the team leader and do things,

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.320
so I don't know the details.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.440
He said he'd become my hands and feet.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.030
But right now my hands and feet are tied up.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:53.740
So then someone needs to do that part to keep the deal, don't you think?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.240
I guess I'll do it.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.030
You're quick at catching the drift.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.810
I'll decide the delivery method for the money from now on.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:09.780
A method that only you and I will know.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.430
Yes.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.060
- Gi Dong Jae?
- This was filmed on the day Gi Dong Jae was released.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.920
And three hours later, the same car was filmed returning in the other lane.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.260
Who's this?

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.530
You know Goo Jae Choon, right? The East Gangnam Gang boss. This is one of his henchmen.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.940
According to the guys we arrested earlier, this guy driving sold the car.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.200
Gi Dong Jae drove this car out, and the East Gangnam Gang drove it back?

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.120
So he drove the car back after killing Gi Dong Jae.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.870
And they sold the car because it would've been a waste just to dump it.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.400
So, the East Gangnam Gang's Goo Jae Choon killed Gi Dong Jae.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.400
He took revenge for the murder of Jo Sang Pil.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.590
The reason he killed him is explainable,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.980
but there's no reason for Gi Dong Jae to go to Goo Jae Choon on his own.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.830
Somebody handed Gi Dong Jae over to Goo Jae Choon.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.920
- Who?
- There was a GPS tracker on the car Gi Dong Jae was in.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.320
I analyzed the data on it, and the jail that Gi Dong Jae was released from was on the tracked route.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.270
From the CCTVs nearby, we obtained this footage here.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:16.260
Oh. Gi Dong Jae got the car here.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.670
The person who gave the car is

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.630
Jang Gi Jin.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.570
Seoul MIU's team leader? That Jang Gi Jin?

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.560
He put a tracker in the car and gave it to Gi Dong Jae.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.050
And by passing the location to Goo Jae Choon he made him kill Gi Dong Jae.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.950
Goo Jae Choon acted on it, but the person who actually killed Gi Dong Jae is Jang Gi Jin.

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:52.540
I think you have to get the surgery.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.510
You were supposed to get the surgery last time you were admitted.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.770
It's getting a lot worse.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.350
I can't do it right at this moment.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.500
I have some things left to do.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.360
What is this?

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.270
Thank you for all the work you've done. Have a meal with the detectives you work with.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.600
No way, I can't take this kind of stuff.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.390
And I gave you a hard time. How could I take this?

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.550
If you don't take this, I'll be in debt. I'll die with debt.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.380
I'm giving this to you for my own sake.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.850
Thank you. I'll use it for something good.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.800
Do the dress shoes I gave you not fit very well?

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.840
Detectives don't wear dress shoes very often because we have to run to catch culprits.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.200
I see, that makes sense. I didn't know about that.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.980
But I make sure to wear those dress shoes when I go anywhere else.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.710
And thanks to those dress shoes, people keep saying that I look like a CEO.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.370
That's good.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.700
Well, by the way, Detective Kang.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.730
The reason my granddaughter died

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.010
has nothing to do with that person called Director Cheon, right?

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.570
Do you mean Cheon Na Na when you say Director Cheon?

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.440
Yes.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.630
From what we investigated, no, she has nothing to do with it.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.380
On the contrary, she helped our investigation.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.270
If it weren't for her, we wouldn't have been able to put away Cheon Sang Woo.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.500
I see. That's good.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:41.100
Anyway, the fact that Cheon Sang Woo ordered someone to murder my granddaughter,

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.140
and Gi Dong Jae killed her will never change, right?

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.050
Yes, that's right.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.030
One moment, please.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:58.590
Yeah? Did you get him? Okay, I'll be in soon, wait for me.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:04.620
Aigoo, I held back a busy person again with my long story.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.880
Go ahead and take your leave.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.450
Yes, thank you.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:25.300
Sir, I'll visit you at the dress shoe store with some chicken.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.950
I'll tell you a lot of fun stories while having a drink with you.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.170
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:34.720
My pleasure.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.650
Okay, I'm coming.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:04.020
The car Gi Dong Jae was driving. You drove it back.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.410
And after that, Gi Dong Jae totally disappeared.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.310
Did you kill Gi Dong Jae?

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:12.660
What? Why would I kill him?

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:18.470
If you didn't kill him, someone else probably did. Then tell us who killed him.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.500
I don't know.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.170
Then why did you drive back the car that Gi Dong Jae was driving?

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.560
Well, Dong Jae Hyeongnim just handed the car over to me.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.480
He asked me to sell it, so I was just trying to sell it for him.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.710
Hey, you said you guys tried to capture and kill Gi Dong Jae not so long ago.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:38.410
But then you're saying Gi Dong Jae asked someone who tried to kill him to sell the car?

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.640
Do you think that makes sense?

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.890
It was Jae Choon, right?

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.770
Goo Jae Choon killed Gi Dong Jae and told you to get rid of the car, right?

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.340
It would've been a waste just to throw it away.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.520
That's why you decided to sell it to an unregistered car business to get some money. Am I wrong?

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.360
I did sell the car, I admit that.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.870
But I really don't know anything more than that.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.720
Think carefully.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.770
You might get blamed for everything if you keep trying to be loyal.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.680
So, moving forward, please tell us to the best of your ability.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.600
On the day you were caught on film, tell us what you did,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.320
where you were, and with whom you met.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.150
If something doesn't fit, we're going to investigate this right away.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.870
Was Dong Jae Hyeongnim's corpse found?

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.400
Perhaps you don't even know if he's dead or alive.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.180
It's inevitable that they killed Gi Dong Jae. Since they're mentioning his corpse, it's obvious.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.070
If they didn't kill him, they wouldn't make excuses.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.390
You know well how difficult it is to prove a crime without a body.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.710
We might end up empty-handed after running around in circles.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.440
The motive for murder is clear, though.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.940
It makes no sense to do nothing when we know that.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.090
Gi Dong Jae is a murderer who killed a person, however,

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:50.500
Gi Dong Jae's family also has the right to know why he died and how he died.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.950
We should also find out why Jang Gi Jin gave Gi Dong Jae to Goo Jae Choon.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.780
It was before Cheon Sang Woo's trial, so maybe it was to protect Cheon Sang Woo.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.190
That's not the whole reason why Gi Dong Jae died.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.350
On the day Woo Tae Ho died, he met with Gi Dong Jae.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.680
I think Woo believed that Cheon Sang Woo was the culprit up until then.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.190
But then, after he met with Gi Dong Jae, he had some sort of revelation and suddenly met with Cheon Na Na.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.740
And then he called us saying he had something to say.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.960
And then he was in an accident.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.990
What on earth did he hear from Gi Dong Jae that caused him to act like that suddenly?

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.950
Isn't it obvious?

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:30.770
What do you think Gi Dong Jae told Woo Tae Ho?

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.520
"I really didn't kill her."

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.190
That's it.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:38.670
"I didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo. There's a separate culprit."

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:43.850
The reason Gi Dong Jae died is because he told Woo Tae Ho about the culprit.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.780
Excuse me.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.720
Yes, welcome.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.730
We're from the Incheon West Violent Crimes Team.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.240
What can I do for you?

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.640
You're Mr. Gi Dong Jae's brother, right?

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.600
Yes.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.480
Are you in touch with your brother by any chance?

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.210
You already know. He's dead.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.070
Then when was the last time you met with him?

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.640
I've never actually met him.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.230
About ten years ago,

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.890
I only saw him for a brief moment on the anniversary of our father's death.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.830
Have you not received a phone call, either?

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.000
Why would I answer a call from a guy who killed someone?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.310
As you said, we also believe that Gi Dong Jae died. However,

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:43.570
shouldn't we at least find his body?

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:47.210
If you have anything that could help with the investigation, please tell us.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.070
Then we can find the perpetrator who murdered Dong Jae—

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.450
Don't find the perpetrator.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.350
And don't find the body either.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.790
I ask of you.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.690
Excuse—

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.440
There's nothing else to get. Leave him be.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.410
I'll leave my business card here.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.670
If you think of anything, please give me a call.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:25.920
I'm a bit confused. For whom are we doing all of this?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.010
We have to find the truth. We have to dig it out, the hidden truth.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.270
The truth was revealed. The culprit is Cheon Sang Woo. He's the murderer.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:38.130
Whoever actually killed her doesn't make a difference.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.880
Do you, by any chance, think that Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.580
Let's be careful.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:54.340
If we investigated whether Gi Dong Jae murdered Jeong Hui Joo like you're saying,

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.580
and if we found out he didn't,

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.160
Cheon Sang Woo would be innocent.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.060
Here, let's take it off, and put this on.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.270
It fits, right?

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.440
Yes, it does.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.770
How did you know my son's shoe size?

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:22.650
- Grandpa says he can tell shoe sizes by looking at the feet.
- Oh, wow!

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.140
Can you really know the size just by looking at the feet?

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.940
Yes. It's my job, so...

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:35.030
Then, I'm sorry, but would you be able to tell what my shoe size is?

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.260
Well,

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.810
why don't you try this on for yourself, then?

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.100
Oh my.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.100
Oh, then.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.570
I'll try it on.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.440
Oh my, would this fit?

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.090
Oh my. Oh my, oh my! It fits perfectly!

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:58.980
Oh my, that's so cool! It fits perfectly, Grandpa!

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:04.300
Oh, Grandpa, thank you so much. It's so pretty.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.310
Jae Woong, hurry up and get up, and say thank you.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.040
Thank you, Grandpa.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.950
Of course.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.190
You have to listen to your mom, okay?

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:20.390
If you don't listen to her and make her worry, the shoes will tighten up and hurt your feet.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.520
What? Really?

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.080
These are magic shoes.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.910
Magic shoes that only good kids wear.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.940
Did you hear him? You have to listen to me.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.980
If you don't, the shoes will make the skin on the back of your heels peel.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.990
Okay?

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.900
Okay.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.680
Grandpa, I'm so grateful.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.450
No, no. It's nothing. Compared to how generous you were, this is nothing.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:51.270
You give me chicken too. You can't imagine how much that consoled me.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.930
Chicken? That's not much.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.750
Well then, I should get going.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.900
If it feels uncomfortable for any reason, tell Eun Hye.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.270
You can't leave like this.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.350
Eun Hye, don't let him go like this. Okay?

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.980
Hey, hey.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.750
Oh well.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.790
Drink for a little bit.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.860
I'll make some food you can eat while drinking and bring it over.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.510
Okay.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.490
Welcome, how many?

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:25.910
Two more are coming.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.390
Okay, you can sit over there.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.770
I mean, why do the detectives want to see us again?

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.780
It's because of Dong Jae Hyeongnim.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.860
Because of Jeong Hui Joo or whatever dying?

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.840
That's already been resolved.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.990
Dong Jae Hyeongnim didn't kill her.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.210
What?

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.550
He told me everything after drinking.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.860
He didn't kill her, and he said he just helped with the aftermath.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.860
Damn it.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.800
Don't you think he just said that to escape being blamed?

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.340
He said he had evidence, too.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:05.910
He left it with his older brother, and he said that his name would be cleared if he opened it up.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.060
Anyway, don't say that when the detectives come later.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.660
What use would that be when Dong Jae Hyeong is already dead?

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.760
It'll just rope us into it.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.580
Hello.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.170
Welcome, is it just the two of you?

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.840
We're meeting these two.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.720
I see. Okay.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.280
Okay.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:28.010
Hey, it's been a while.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.980
How have you been?

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.070
You missed us, right?

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.470
Why did you call us again?

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:36.760
Just because! We're the best of friends, right? You lost some weight.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.580
Really. Hey, what's good is good, right?

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.790
Let's just have a glass of soju and talk about Gi Dong Jae.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.960
He was your hyeongnim, so shouldn't we at least find his body?

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.860
And let's find out if he's dead or alive.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.310
- I've never seen you before.
- I was at the factory.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.980
Really? I didn't know.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.020
Oh, hello.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.710
Yes.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.160
Hey, is it true that Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo?

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.090
They were just saying things to each other. You can't trust everything they said.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:17.390
But they must have some kind of basis to talk about that, don't you think?

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:21.680
Well, then we'll go back in and ask about that again.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.340
You can't just imagine things.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.810
The results came out from a thorough investigation, you see? And the evidence is straightforward, too.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.830
- Yes, yes, I went to the trial and confirmed that too.
- Yes.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.350
But then, I just heard that story for myself just now, so...

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.850
To tell you the truth, if what they're saying is true, the situation becomes very complicated.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.020
Worst-case, Cheon Sang Woo might get released too.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.370
That shouldn't happen.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:47.350
I, myself, saw and heard Cheon Sang Woo telling him to kill Hui Joo.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.630
No, that can't happen.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:59.200
The West Incheon guys arrested one of ours. They're looking for Gi Dong Jae.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:05.700
They won't find the body, but they'll put the charges on us and narrow down the investigation.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.800
Oh Ji Hyeok is involved. He'll hold onto this to the very end.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.600
That's your business.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.210
I don't remember asking you to kill Gi Dong Jae for me.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.020
That's true.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.570
But we weren't the only ones with a reason to kill him.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.740
You guys needed him gone, too.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.010
There's something that bastard Gi Dong Jae said before dying.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:35.140
Hyeongnim, hear me out for a moment. Hyeongnim!

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.680
Hyeongnim, there's something I hid!

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.260
Something that could change your life!

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.280
You bastard, if this turns out to be nothing, I'm not going to let you die easily.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.740
Got that?

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.250
Say it.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.170
Hyeongnim...

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:54.780
One of the TJ family members killed a person.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.280
I have evidence of that.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.130
And?

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:05.260
Let me make one call to my brother, and he'll bring it over.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:11.510
And if you threaten TJ with that, you will be able to get an unimaginable amount of money.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.960
Then make the call.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.000
[Dong Jae]

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.220
[Dong Jae]

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.480
He's not answering?

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.610
No.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.260
I'll try one more time. Just once more.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.520
That's enough, you bastard.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.630
You're such a bad guy, aren't you?

00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:00.290
You're roping in your brother so you can live.

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:03.510
You're a total bully.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.110
Throw this bastard away.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.900
Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim!

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.910
The Cheon family member that Dong Jae mentioned.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.140
That person gave you orders, and that's why you gave us Gi Dong Jae, right?

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.910
Team Leader, we're accomplices.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.340
You're a total bully, too, just like him.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.320
He's over there. Gi Dong Soo, the brother of Gi Dong Jae that you're looking for.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.180
I see.

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.960
Thank you for the drive.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:05.400
[Appliance Repair Specialist]

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:08.470
He said he had evidence, too.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:14.670
He left it with his older brother, and he said that his name would be cleared if he opened it up.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.800
Excuse me.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.420
Yes.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.700
How can I help you?

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.360
Yes, well.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.850
I'm the person known as Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.840
And?

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.740
Well, I have something to tell you.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.830
Are you here to get an apology?

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:41.470
My brother committed an unforgivable crime. I apologize for having such a brother.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.080
Is that enough?

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.880
Well, I don't have any bad feelings toward you.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.800
Then what do you want?

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.520
Well. Perhaps,

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.920
did your younger brother leave anything with you?

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.220
No.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.840
I'm not saying I would do anything with it.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.440
I just want to know

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.350
who actually killed my granddaughter.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:11.130
Only after knowing that, I will be able to close my eyes in peace. That's why I'm doing this.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.120
The trial is over.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.130
The police announced it too. It's true that asshole Dong Jae killed her.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:21.880
I don't know why you're doing this to me now. I don't know why...

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.940
I don't know why I have to be in pain again because of that asshole.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.980
Due to me coming to you. I've made you suffer.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.440
I've forgotten about him.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.110
I've even forgotten that he is my brother.

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.950
But you're making me think about him again.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.470
I'm... I'm really sorry.

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:50.340
I didn't think of this. I didn't think of you.

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.700
I was just being greedy for myself, so

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.940
I've made a mistake. I apologize.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:02.730
Why are you doing this? You've cleared your granddaughter's grievance.

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:06.770
The abettor was captured, and Dong Jae died too.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.280
Shouldn't you just think of resting easy?

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.490
Why do you keep imagining things and causing yourself to suffer even more?

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.130
It's because I'm not over it.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.110
At the end of my life, "I have no regrets even if I die!"

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.150
I just want to say that one sentence before I die. That's why.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.310
Okay.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:39.110
You said he didn't leave anything.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:40.480
Yes.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.600
I understand.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.270
A person who lost their family, or the person whose family member is a murderer.

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:53.660
I didn't know that they both feel pain the same way.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.190
I won't be coming back.

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:28.750
Dong Jae didn't leave anything with me.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:33.820
I discovered what he hid while cleaning up his things.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:39.340
If you open this, you'll be able to rest easy.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:49.560
The person who killed your granddaughter... it was, in fact, Dong Jae.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.220
You don't have to think about other possibilities anymore.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.890
Take care.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.770
Hui Joo.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:18.890
Hui Joo.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.020
Hui Joo, how did this...

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.340
Hui Joo.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.340
Hello.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.200
Oh my, what brings you here?

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.870
I have something to tell you.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:54.430
Oh dear, one moment, one moment, please.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:05.200
We intend to make a scholarship foundation in the name of Ms. Jeong Hui Joo.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.030
Excuse me?

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.490
Why?

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:15.210
It means that we sincerely apologize for Ms. Jeong Hui Joo's unfair death, and we'll never forget it.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.350
Is that true?

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:19.940
There will be an opening ceremony for the foundation soon.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.400
I came to get your permission before then.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.990
Oh, well, I'm...

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.440
Hui Joo would be happy too.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.250
Then I'll take that as a yes.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.230
Yes, yes.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.980
I didn't know you thought of my Hui Joo so much.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.600
Thank you so much.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.930
Thank you so much.

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.650
Yes, goodbye.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.680
What can I do for you?

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.460
What? Who are you?

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.850
Why are you doing this?

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.610
Who are all of you? What are you doing?

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.620
Close the door!

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.490
What?

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.060
What are you doing?

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.880
Are you Dong Jae's older brother?

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.140
Why aren't you answering?

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.150
What?

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:40.020
Are you sure that grandpa took it?

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.930
Okay.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.300
I'll think a bit and...

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.720
I'll call back in a bit!

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.630
It won't take too long.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.040
Yes.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:08.410
Thank you.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.930
Did you tell Team Leader Choi Yong Geun?

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.080
About?

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.470
That the delivery method for the money has changed.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:20.260
No, not yet.

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.550
You don't have to tell him.

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:28.250
Is that why you asked for me?

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:32.540
No, just. I have something to ask you.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.640
Is it true that the person known as Gi Dong Jae killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.060
Yes.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:46.690
Have the clothes that Jung Hui Joo was wearing when Gi Dong Jae killed her been found?

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.060
No.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.210
Then why does Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather have them?

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.970
H-How do you know that?

00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:59.660
I just found out too.

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.630
I saw it with my own eyes

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.180
at Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather's store today.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:08.410
How did you know it was Jeong Hui Joo's clothing?

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.130
I met her on the day she was murdered.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:15.320
It looked the same as the clothing she was wearing that day.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.680
You met with her on that day?

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.980
Is it weird that I met with an employee at my company?

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.880
No, no.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:27.250
But what are you curious about?

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.890
Honestly, I'm a bit worried.

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:36.800
Due to the evidence that was found this late in the game, I'm worried that the trial result might change.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.040
Because I'm hoping that the trial result will be upheld.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:46.410
The fact that the grandpa has that evidence means that he hasn't told the detectives yet.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:51.430
I don't want that evidence to be handed over to the police,

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:55.950
because I don't know what Cheon Sang Woo would do to use it.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:01.970
If he comes out for any reason, there's no telling what he'll do to me.

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:04.150
He'll probably try to kill me.

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:08.000
No, he will kill me.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.530
Please get rid of that evidence.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.910
Every trace of it.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:16.950
Okay.

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.500
I'll try.

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:27.190
After today, you will become a person who has saved me.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.700
Have you ever killed someone before?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.030
- Excuse me?
- Sometimes detectives kill people, right?

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:47.640
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:53.510
Even if you're a detective, it's not easy for a person to kill someone.

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.650
I haven't...

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.220
yet.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.040
You said you and I are accomplices, right?

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.740
I'm just saying...

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:19.240
All I'm saying is, let's just help each other out since we're in the same boat.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.950
That's your point of view.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.460
In my point of view, I let you on my boat.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.240
On a boat that I'm steering, do you understand?

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.840
Yes. That's right.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.300
You're right.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.780
Then do as I say.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.290
Okay?

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.760
[Eun Hye]

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.730
There's no evidence that says Gi Dong Jae isn't the culprit.

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:49.570
However, there's also no evidence that says he killed her himself.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:53.430
This was taken in the direction of the murder site.

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:55.120
Jeong Hui Joo's not in there.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.320
That means he was driving with the already dead Jeong Hui Joo in the car.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.930
That means he didn't kill her where he dumped the body.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:03.490
If you look at this,

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:08.120
Choi Yong Geun asks where Gi Dong Jae is and asks, "What about Jeong Hui Joo's body?"

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.990
He asked, knowing that Jeong Hui Joo was already dead.

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:14.320
He doesn't even ask about how he killed Jeong Hui Joo.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.620
Judging just from this recording,

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.520
it can be seen that Gi Dong Jae was only responsible for the dumping of the body

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.140
by disguising the murdered body as a serial murder victim.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.070
So what you're saying is that it's possible someone else killed Jeong Hui Joo,

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:30.470
and Gi Dong Jae was only responsible for getting rid of the body?

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:31.960
Correct.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.200
Yes, this is Oh Ji Hyeok from Incheon West Violent Crimes Division 2.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.890
Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather is in danger.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:35.500
[The People's Police of the Righteous Republic of Korea]

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.830
Hey, can't you reach him?

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:39.330
No, he won't answer his phone.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.290
You've requested his cellphone GPS location, right?

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:42.550
Yes.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.010
Let's go.

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:05.930
Grandpa. Grandpa.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.620
Grandpa?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.610
Grandpa, are you in there?

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:31.260
[Eun Hye, I've lived long enough. I'm going to go meet my granddaughter now. Have a happy life.]

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.150
Hyeongnim, his phone location has been found.

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.790
Where is it?

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.310
Grandpa.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.620
What is this?

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.880
Come on!

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.510
Come on, seriously.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:10.090
Come on.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.410
Endure it just a little more, come on.

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:16.170
You'll meet your granddaughter soon.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.770
Okay?

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:45.040
♫ Baby (baby). You give me real good feelings (that's alright) ♫

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.760
♫ I'm telling you, baby (baby) ♫

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.560
♫ I'm in a really good mood now (you're outasight) ♫

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.900
♫ We're gonna have a ♫

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.240

Why did they do this to Grandpa?

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.220
He's not a police officer anymore. He's a criminal.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.370
Where you can't be seen, where I can't see you, you just need to go there.

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:08.270
- I'm asking, who is the person that gave you that body?
- Woo Tae Ho.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.510
There's only one reason for a detective to go to the NFS.

01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:12.770
We've confirmed there's blood from more than one person.

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:16.790
If something happens later on, he's planning to bring up concealment of evidence.

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.860
If you stop here, nothing will befall you.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.740
The culprit will stop too?

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.090
If I was the culprit, I think I would.
