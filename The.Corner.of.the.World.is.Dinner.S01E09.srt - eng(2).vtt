00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.840
Right now, the three of you are dancing well.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.479
But it's still missing something.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.319
At the moment, Li Zhenggui is the best dancer.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.599
But Li Zhenggui, don't get cocky.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.039
You need to motivate those

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.759
who aren't dancing as well.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.280
Unity is strength.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.560
Only then can we accomplish

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.159
the task assigned by the organization.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.879
Gain three thousand followers.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.719
So the three of you can

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000
choreograph a dance that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.719
practical for everyday life.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.719
Down-to-earth.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.919
Sunny, positive, full of energy.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.639
How did one livestream

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:14.680
end up losing twenty?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.319
Let's just treat it as rehearsal.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.040
Working on the weekend?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.600
I just made some hot tea.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.800
Have a cup before you go.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.639
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.040
So,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.680
I need to head to the office to prepare.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.480
I'll skip the tea for now.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.399
It's my turn to take out the trash today.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.000
It's fine.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.800
I'll do it on my way.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.199
Have you noticed

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.040
that Hui's been acting a bit

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.959
strange lately?

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.480
I think she's got something on her mind.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.600
I asked her about it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.279
But she didn't say a word.

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:31.720
Where are you going?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.879
To practice dancing.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.279
Are you dancing in the bathroom?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.079
Bathroom first.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.800
Relief.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.240
This is the training system

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.639
we designed for BG Company.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.800
Director Ma,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.439
I've finished my report.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.319
Please give your instructions.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.920
That was impressive.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
No wonder you're our company's

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.439
senior training consultant.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.519
Very precise positioning.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.199
And the needs analysis is thorough.

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.439
The setup of this training system

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.079
really matches our major client's

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:07.240
organizational development needs at BG Company.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:08.519
Thank you, Director Ma.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.480
You're too kind.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:10.240
Director Ma,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
actually, I've been following

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.800
this project all along.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.839
Plus, I have a great relationship

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.279
with their Director Chen.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:17.959
This project,

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.680
from initiation to research,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.480
was all organized and arranged by me.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.160
Yihan, share your thoughts

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.480
on this proposal.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.160
Okay.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.680
First of all,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.680
this project

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.360
wasn't it dumped here before he left?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.439
If Zhang Hui hadn't kept following up,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.920
this project would've failed.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.480
He still has the nerve to talk.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.519
But the training volume

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.040
is a bit conservative.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.800
Zhang Hui,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.920
this can't keep up with BG's growth.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.600
Right?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.360
Director Li,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.519
project implementation takes time.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.639
If we go too aggressive at first,

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.279
and something isn't perfected,

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.360
or needs improvement,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.639
and we don't improve it,

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.560
it'll end up hurting

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.879
our reputation and the client's interests.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.120
First,

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.480
whether the project is complete

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.319
is what you, as a consultant,

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.120
must address immediately.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.879
But whether the training volume is enough

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.439
has nothing to do with being

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.959
conservative or aggressive.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:12.319
Zhang Hui,

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.240
if you're not capable,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.439
just say so anytime.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:15.560
Director Ma,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.160
I worked my way up from the front lines.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.399
So her excuses don't fool me.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
This proposal

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.720
does fit

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.680
BG Company's previous requirements.

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.639
But recently,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.439
BG headquarters is planning global layoffs.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.040
And this round

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.439
will soon affect our China branch.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.240
Also, the market now

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360
is shifting toward

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.920
AI-assisted online methods.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.480
But our proposal is still

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:44.199
mainly traditional and offline.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.120
Li Yihan,

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.680
if you took this proposal

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.000
to BG right now,

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.439
do you think they'd accept it?

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.120
Yes, that's right, Director Ma.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.240
Your insight into the training market

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:01.720
is truly visionary.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.879
It also makes up for

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.800
our shortcomings.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.000
That's right.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.199
I just recently

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.800
returned after some time away.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.920
I came back in response to the company's call.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.959
I'm back at my post.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:17.319
So the main person in charge

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.800
is still Zhang Hui.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.480
She's fully responsible.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.360
Don't worry.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:23.000
I'll follow your instructions

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.279
and urge her to improve it quickly.

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.879
I didn't expect you to do this.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.720
I trusted you with such an important client.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.240
And this is how you did the market research?

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.159
If it weren't for

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.919
Director Ma's sharp insight,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.440
this project would've failed.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.639
If BG is gone,

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.120
you're out immediately.

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:49.879
Alright then.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.879
Everyone understands the importance of this proposal.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:52.720
That's enough.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:54.480
Let's wait and see.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.440
That's it for today's meeting.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.159
Meeting adjourned.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.039
Director Ma, take care.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.559
Did you see that?

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.600
You need to have this.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.840
You have to lift it up.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.919
Your face needs to be raised.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.279
This is the crown shape.

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:37.679
Palm.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.840
Look at how they're dancing.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.679
Did you see that?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.519
Yu Dama is really dancing well.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.960
You were probably like me
when you were young.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.440
A talented and beautiful woman.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.879
Director Ma

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.879
Let me show you.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.240
This is my revised proposal.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.279
Briefly explain what you changed.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.720
Director Ma

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:11.279
The AI online training you mentioned

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.000
is definitely a future trend.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.759
But

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.320
online training is actually for

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.519
individual skill development.

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:17.840
But for BG Company,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.519
the system we designed

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.399
is aimed at future managers.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440
Those future managers

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440
need more focus on

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.679
interpersonal skills and influence.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:26.279
So

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.080
the online model

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.799
may not help them much.

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.080
They still need offline training.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.120
Director Ma

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.440
I found some recent research papers

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:40.480
and attached them at the end.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.000
These can support

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.320
my previous proposal.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.879
Isn't this our company's solution?

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:06.240
Why does the other company
have the exact same thing?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.240
This company—

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:15.879
Is it the one Li Yihan

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:17.320
switched to before?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.000
Director Ma

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:18.960
Ma.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.879
Zhang Hui

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.000
If you have any issues,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.120
report to me immediately,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.440
not bypassing the chain of command.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.360
Director Ma

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.080
About this matter—

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:33.679
Zhang Hui

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.519
Why do you think their company

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.879
has our business secrets?

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:41.320
Secrets?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.120
What secrets?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.000
What's going on?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.440
This—this can't be, this—

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.799
This...

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.600
Director Ma

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.440
I understand now.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.799
It must be

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:57.080
those who joined the competitor

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.120
who did this.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.120
They were upset about being fired

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120
so they took our secrets

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.480
to trade for their future.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.639
Those people are really—

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.399
Li Yihan

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.000
How can you be so sure

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.840
it was those former employees?

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:10.360
Director Ma

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.039
Here's the situation.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.519
I just got the news myself.

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:14.679
So I rushed over to report to you.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000
Zhang Hui

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.799
You didn't do this, did you?

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:25.799
You're upset I got promoted
and you didn't.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.559
And you resented me rejecting your plan.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:29.240
So you took revenge on me
and the company.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.879
Li Yihan, don't make baseless accusations.

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:32.960
Director Ma

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.440
Give me a few minutes.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.360
I can find out

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.120
which account downloaded

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.799
these files.

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.720
To prevent leaks,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.039
our R&D team

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:51.799
specifically asked IT

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:53.440
to set up a system.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.799
Once a file is downloaded,

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:56.120
it leaves a digital trail.

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:02.879
And for these files,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.639
all the download accounts are

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.159
Li Yihan.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.879
You convinced twelve senior staff
to quit together,

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:20.639
waiting for a chance to rise.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.039
And you smeared me and the old staff.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.000
I couldn't figure out

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
why the other company
would help you

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.639
set up such a big trap.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.840
Ruining all the old staff's futures,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.759
while you returned to the company
unscathed,

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:33.720
and got promoted and a raise.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.039
Now I understand.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:38.600
Zhang Hui

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.360
Don't think you can frame me
with fake evidence.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.879
and accuse me falsely.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.879
You think—

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:44.960
Director Ma

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.879
Director Ma, let me explain.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:19.720
Just dance like this.

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:20.600
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.480
Your hand must be like this.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.000
Yes, yes.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.240
Stick your butt out.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.919
Li Zhenggui

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.440
That's how it should be.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.320
In life,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.480
you must try new things.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.600
Great dancing.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.879
I can see you have real potential.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:37.519
Keep working hard, keep it up.

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:39.000
Your hand should be like that.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.919
My back can't take it anymore.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.720
Everyone,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.879
thanks for watching.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.080
Bye-bye.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.399
See you next time.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.240
How many new followers?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.240
Two hours.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:54.919
Twenty followers.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.960
When you were dancing just now,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.440
there were thirty old men watching.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.519
I only got twenty in two hours.

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.080
Do you know why?

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.519
Because those thirty old men

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:08.000
are all bachelors.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.039
My body can't keep up anymore.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.240
My back can't compare to you young folks.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.240
Keep working hard.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.039
I'm your fan now.

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.440
Keep it up!

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.519
My neck isn't good.

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.639
And my back, I—

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:28.720
Me too.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.080
Two hours.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.320
Twenty followers.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.200
That's a bit slow.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.279
No, that's not enough.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.919
I need to come up with something clever.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.679
Help me! Come back quickly!

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.480
Come home and save me!

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.320
Hui

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.159
Are you free after work?

00:15:59.159 --> 00:15:59.960
Let's get together.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.519
Not today.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:01.279
I have things to do at home.

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.039
I'm heading home now.

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:02.360
Next time.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.080
Bye.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440
Don't make it too heavy.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.639
That would be too flashy.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.759
For her look,

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.960
Don't make the outfit like

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.000
the White Lady's hairstyle.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.720
Zhenggui

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:14.399
It's fine.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.799
If it's fine, why call us to help?

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.720
If you don't come back soon,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.840
she's going to drive me crazy.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.279
How do you want us to help?

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.039
Travel through time with me.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.680
Hello, everyone.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.440
Welcome to my livestream.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.240
This is our Jiangzhou ancient town.

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:26.680
Xuanxi

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:29.400
It's built on a river,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.880
so it's named after the river.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.960
Up to now,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.519
it has seven hundred fifty years of history.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:38.839
These three are our invited guests.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:40.480
Come on, say hi to everyone.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.799
First time on camera,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.400
feels like being a star.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.519
Of course!

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.640
Just look at

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:52.240
who picked the outfits.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:57.519
Relax a bit.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:00.240
Pretend we're just traveling.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.680
Traveling.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.400
Coming to the ancient town,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400
there's a special title.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.880
It's called Beautiful China.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.799
Here, there are not only

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:12.000
trendy, bold old town streets,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.119
but also fun, modern shops.

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:19.119
And unique East-West fusion buildings.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.920
Plus a food street for eating and drinking.

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:23.599
In this dreamy, lit-up Jiangnan,

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:25.079
you can experience

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.880
the romance of traveling through time.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.880
That's all for today's stream.

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:50.720
Thank you for watching.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.359
See you next time.

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:54.079
Bye.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.559
How many new followers?

00:18:57.319 --> 00:18:58.079
Three.

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.759
Only three?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.480
Just three short.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.759
The video account reached two thousand.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.079
Still a bit away from three thousand,

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.000
just a little short.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.559
Let's call today's promo a success.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.119
We did it!

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.680
It was worth it.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.839
I'll cook a feast for you tonight.

00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:25.160
Hui

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:26.880
Where do you feel unwell?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.559
Feels a bit seasick.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.319
Was the stream too long today?

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.359
It's fine, we're almost there.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.960
Hot oil brings out the spices' aroma.

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:10.759
Mix everything together.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.160
Cilantro beef salad.

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:14.319
Perfect.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.799
Next, let's make Tom Yum soup.

00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:30.799
In Thai,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.599
Tom Yum means sour and spicy.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.359
Yum means shrimp.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.359
A rich, tasty soup.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.400
Fresh and appetizing.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.440
Hui will surely love it.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.559
Smells amazing.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.039
Mistake, mistake.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.440
What's wrong?

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:43.200
Didn't we just finish

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.759
the task Yu Dama gave us?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.759
Yeah.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.119
That's why it was a mistake.

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.920
When I'm streaming,

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:51.519
why is it so hard to gain followers?

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.119
Why is that?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.559
Because I underestimated my own beauty.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:01.599
I thought I looked great in modern clothes.

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:02.400
But I didn't expect

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.680
that in ancient costume,

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:10.720
my charm is at its peak.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.480
Still,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.279
today is a victorious day.

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.720
Let's celebrate!

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:21.680
To victory!

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680
To victory!

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:23.920
To dinner!

00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:34.160
Hui

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.960
This is your favorite lettuce salad.

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.720
I made it just for you.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.039
Try it.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.759
Specially made?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.119
It's so delicious.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.319
It made me cry.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.279
What's wrong?

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:40.319
I added wasabi in it.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.519
I heard wasabi relieves stress.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.480
Not that much, though.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.240
Hui

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:04.440
It's good to cry out your sadness.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.720
We're always here for you.

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.319
I'm pregnant.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.160
But we've already broken up.

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.039
If this world

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.279
let men have babies instead,

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:45.359
a lot of things would be different.
