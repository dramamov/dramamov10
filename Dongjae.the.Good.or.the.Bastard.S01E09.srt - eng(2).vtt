(Cheongju Prosecution Service)

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:24.972
What did Im Yu-ri ask you to do?

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.225
It's true that Gyeo-rye
brought the bag.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.519
It was caught in the camera.
We cannot deny it.

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:32.896
She asked me to check
the men's restroom.

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:36.316
She knew where the bag was
in which men's restroom slot.

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:37.943
She couldn't go in,

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:40.362
so she asked you to bring it.

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:43.782
Because she couldn't go in,
she asked me to get it for her.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.284
What did she ask you to get
for her?

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:48.870
The bag inside the last stall.

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:52.332
She asked me to get that for her.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:55.043
Did you do as she said?

00:00:55.794 --> 00:00:57.628
Did you pick it up
and give it to her?

00:00:58.588 --> 00:00:59.631
Yes.

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.304
- You mean this?
- Yes.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.559
When was the next time
you saw it again?

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:12.436
I never saw it again.

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:13.770
That little...

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:16.273
Then was the last time you saw it
at the terminal?

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:18.108
That was the last time.

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.902
After she took it,
I never saw it again.

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:24.823
The bag Im Yu-ri took was

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:27.617
found in her house
after her death.

00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:30.412
To be exact, it was found
in her room.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.958
That's strange.

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.044
Even if you were friends,

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:40.212
when she asked you
to pick up something

00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:42.006
a stranger left
in the men's restroom,

00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:44.051
didn't you think that was strange?

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.428
I knew it was strange.

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.556
So I opened it in front of her
and asked what it was.

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.934
Then she got angry.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.203
Your friend asked for a favor.

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.688
You didn't know what it was,
yet you still did it for her.

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:59.733
You were shocked to see
what was inside, so you tried to

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.318
put it back,
but Yu-ri stopped you.

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:02.986
Did Ms. Im Yu-ri get mad at you?

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:04.529
Yes.

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:05.739
She quickly closed the bag

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:07.699
and urged you to leave.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:09.159
Yet you wanted to return it...

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:10.869
I told her we shouldn't,

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:12.662
so I tried to return it.

00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:15.082
Then the owner of the bag
showed up.

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:17.334
I was too scared
to give it back to him.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.755
Until you opened the bag
in front of Im Yu-ri,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.924
were you aware of what was inside?

00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:27.886
You had no idea what it was.

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:30.097
No. I didn't open it until then.

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:32.766
When you opened it,
what was inside?

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:35.477
Pills.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:38.938
There were a lot of small pills.

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.234
That is all.

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:56.873
Please take a look
at Ms. Im Yu-ri here.

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.293
While the defendant went
to the restroom,

00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:02.129
she was by herself.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.464
She was looking at her phone

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.883
like anyone her age would.

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.219
Do you think
she'd stare at her phone

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.054
nonchalantly

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.973
after asking him to get her drugs?

00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.642
Just like how the defendant is
underage,

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.978
so was the victim.

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:19.688
She must've been
nervous and scared.

00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:22.482
Does the girl in the video look
like she's trying to steal drugs?

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:25.694
I'm sorry,
but may I say something?

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.071
No, ignore him.

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:31.116
His speculation
of her staring at her phone

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:33.577
proves that she was innocent

00:03:33.702 --> 00:03:35.662
is only a mere speculation.

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:39.040
Above all, if she was innocent
for looking at her phone,

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.709
for the same reason,

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:44.796
that action is closely related
to the crime.

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:49.050
No, ignore him, Si-woon.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.971
- How does that work?
- Damn it. He fell for it.

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:57.184
What if she was looking
at her drug deals?

00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.978
Because drugs would be
in her hands soon.

00:04:00.103 --> 00:04:02.022
What if she was checking
the orders?

00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:06.985
Isn't that also a speculation?

00:04:07.402 --> 00:04:09.487
It's already been approved

00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:11.990
that Im Yu-ri received orders
via online messenger

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.201
and sold drugs.

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:15.368
No?

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:17.787
Did Im Yu-ri sell drugs or not?

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.924
She did.

00:04:30.342 --> 00:04:31.384
Yes.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.721
I agree that this could lead

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:36.765
to various interpretations.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.391
Speaking of which,

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:42.896
do you have ways to check
what she was watching on her phone

00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:44.689
in that moment?

00:04:45.482 --> 00:04:48.109
Was it caught
on a surveillance camera?

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.492
No.

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:57.845
The prosecutor's argument
that an underaged victim

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:59.788
wouldn't just stare at her phone

00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:02.290
while trying to steal drugs

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:03.875
contradicts

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.961
involved party's testimony.

00:05:06.627 --> 00:05:07.921
Your honor.

00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:10.090
To confirm that,

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:13.385
I request a witness who argues
to trade drugs with Im Yu-ri

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.303
for a long time.

00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:16.471
A witness?

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:18.848
Is your witness here?

00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:20.016
Yes.

00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:24.396
We'll take 10 before
the witness attends the trial.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.940
The defendant may return
to his seat.

00:06:00.848 --> 00:06:01.890
Park Chan-hyuk?

00:06:43.767 --> 00:06:45.101
(Lee Jun-hyuk)

00:06:50.357 --> 00:06:51.649
(Park Sung-woong)

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.210
(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

00:07:11.378 --> 00:07:13.713
(Episode 9)

00:07:14.964 --> 00:07:16.591
I told you to go easy on him.

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:18.968
Put Park Chan-hyuk on the phone.

00:07:22.222 --> 00:07:23.807
It was CEO Nam's doing.

00:07:48.748 --> 00:07:49.999
(Lee Dong-cheol)

00:07:55.964 --> 00:07:59.426
Three including this guy are
all on the wanted list.

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:03.346
Prosecutor Jo probably told you
about the rest.

00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:04.931
What I want to tell you is

00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:07.475
that they're done for.

00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:09.853
So you don't need to
run away from them

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.938
to prison.

00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.275
What I have left now is CEO Nam.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:18.403
And the only person who can put
an end to his life

00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:21.614
is in front of me.

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:30.498
Just as you remember.

00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:32.750
That Nam Wan-seong

00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:34.586
kidnapped you,

00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:36.880
tortured you,

00:08:38.006 --> 00:08:39.632
- and forced you to perjure.
- Yes.

00:08:42.343 --> 00:08:43.470
That's all you need to say.

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:45.972
But if I were you,

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:49.309
I wouldn't hope them
to be arrested.

00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:52.812
I mean, who are you?

00:08:54.981 --> 00:08:56.900
You're the head
of Cheongju gang now.

00:08:58.526 --> 00:08:59.569
Right?

00:09:00.403 --> 00:09:03.239
Don't you want to
teach them a lesson?

00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:05.116
That's all you need to say

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:07.577
to be free.

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:40.527
Wait.

00:09:40.652 --> 00:09:43.404
Like you said,
I don't have any skills,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.574
but I'll work hard until
my hands and feet are honed.

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:48.409
Look at your palms.

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.578
How can you gombang
without any wrinkles?

00:09:51.454 --> 00:09:52.830
Gakumok, lumber.

00:09:52.956 --> 00:09:54.374
Jiltong, carrier.

00:09:54.499 --> 00:09:55.874
Narasi, evenly.

00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:57.502
Gonguri, concrete.

00:09:57.627 --> 00:09:59.295
Gombang, moving materials.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.090
I can move materials no problem.

00:10:02.215 --> 00:10:04.175
It'll get me bread for my family.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.344
I'm begging you. Please.

00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:09.429
Follow me.

00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.351
No Kim or Lee.
Call everyone captains.

00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:15.645
No drinking before work.
No hands in your pockets.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.105
No phone at work.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.232
Be here by 7 a.m..
Leave at 5 p.m..

00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:21.401
15-minute break every 3 hours.
Lunch is at 1 p.m..

00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:22.610
What's your name?

00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:24.445
Hwang Si-mok.

00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:26.698
- Okay. Hwang. See that?
- Yes.

00:10:28.283 --> 00:10:29.826
- Move them over there, okay?
- Yes.

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:31.244
Captain, wait.

00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:35.039
Do people work here at night too?

00:10:35.164 --> 00:10:36.666
You mean overtime
or graveyard shift?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.835
There's a graveyard shift?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.503
Of course.
We work 24 hours nonstop.

00:10:41.337 --> 00:10:43.172
What are you doing over there?
Hurry up.

00:10:44.591 --> 00:10:47.010
If it runs 24 hours, when
will I get to ransack the place?

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:53.391
Hello. Excuse me.

00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:55.226
Wait.

00:10:56.561 --> 00:10:57.729
Shoot.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.742
Captain.

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:13.536
It looks like the construction
has been on for a while,

00:11:14.454 --> 00:11:16.456
but how come only this much
has been done so far?

00:11:17.373 --> 00:11:19.584
Are you saying we're slacking off?

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:21.044
No, that's not what I'm saying.

00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:24.839
Geez, I wish your hands were
as busy as your mouth.

00:11:24.964 --> 00:11:26.441
What are you doing?
Keep shoveling already.

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:27.967
Yes.

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:29.344
Sure.

00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:37.142
Oh, right.

00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:39.979
I heard the construction
was stopped before.

00:11:40.104 --> 00:11:41.939
- Right?
- Yes.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:44.984
Is that why the ground is bumpy?

00:11:45.777 --> 00:11:48.071
The ground is always bumpy.

00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:49.447
- No.
- What?

00:11:49.572 --> 00:11:51.157
- That's not what I meant.
- Okay.

00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:54.827
It feels bumpy

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:57.288
as if you just poured the cement.

00:11:57.413 --> 00:12:00.041
If you poured the cement,

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:01.417
that's not a ground.

00:12:05.338 --> 00:12:08.173
If you poured the cement,
that's not a ground anymore.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.843
If it's not a ground, what is it?

00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:14.972
(DANGER! DO NOT APPROACH)

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.204
What are you doing in there?

00:12:39.205 --> 00:12:41.958
Captain, did you say
the restroom was this...

00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:44.127
Hwang, don't you see this?

00:12:44.252 --> 00:12:46.462
'Danger. Do not approach.'

00:12:48.214 --> 00:12:50.717
I see it. I do.

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:03.396
The weather isn't
getting any warmer.

00:13:08.025 --> 00:13:10.611
Don't feel like
talking about the weather? Then

00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:12.380
should I ask about
how you've been doing?

00:13:12.405 --> 00:13:14.490
You start with a small talk

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:16.826
and slowly get to the point, no?

00:13:19.328 --> 00:13:20.788
Because you're all busy.

00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:23.916
Speak for yourself.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.919
That's why you gathered all of us
here without manners.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.714
What are you pulling here?

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.758
I have no manners,

00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:34.093
and you have no loyalty.

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:35.511
What?

00:13:35.636 --> 00:13:38.431
Honorable Congressman
Kim Sang-hoe.

00:13:38.806 --> 00:13:40.683
The congressman is displeased

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:42.035
that a prosecutor in the district
mentioned the congress.

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.854
I'll explain it to him in person...

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:46.355
The congressman is busy.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.524
Mayor Lee Jong-myeong.

00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:51.235
I keep hearing rumors about you.

00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:53.780
That will leave me no choice
but to think twice.

00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:55.490
Ms. Jeon Mi-ran.

00:13:55.615 --> 00:13:57.950
I can't just ask the office

00:13:58.075 --> 00:13:59.827
to give me the case.

00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:03.206
Why bother all of you one by one

00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:05.833
when I know you're busy?

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.001
So,

00:14:08.878 --> 00:14:11.380
the strong tie between
Congressman Kim and me,

00:14:11.506 --> 00:14:14.008
the fun time Mayor Lee and I had,

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:17.470
and strong friendship
between Ms. Jeon and me.

00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:21.182
Let's share it like we're one.

00:14:23.434 --> 00:14:24.477
Oh, Mayor Lee.

00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:26.729
I heard the baseball stadium
you built on my land is

00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:28.898
worth 80 million dollars?

00:14:29.023 --> 00:14:30.942
But it looks no more

00:14:31.067 --> 00:14:32.819
than 5 million dollars worth.

00:14:33.277 --> 00:14:34.320
CEO Nam.

00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:38.241
What about the fact that the city
purchased that land from you?

00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:39.534
Oh, then

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:42.787
do you want to start with that?
Since you brought it up.

00:14:45.373 --> 00:14:48.459
What was it that you mentioned,
Ms. Jeon?

00:14:48.584 --> 00:14:51.504
Your brother is nothing
but a pain in the neck?

00:14:53.256 --> 00:14:56.050
Was your brother the only thing
I have on my plate?

00:14:57.176 --> 00:14:58.594
Don't cross the line.

00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:00.888
Don't make me cross the line.

00:15:03.683 --> 00:15:05.518
I mean, you should be aware of it,

00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:08.479
so you won't be shocked
when it's on the news.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:10.982
CEO Nam.

00:15:11.482 --> 00:15:13.442
Blackmailing to disclose it

00:15:13.568 --> 00:15:15.152
isn't like you.

00:15:15.278 --> 00:15:17.530
If I'm blackmailing,
you'll be relieved.

00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:20.074
It should end with blackmailing.
If it becomes real...

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:21.617
Gosh.

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:23.953
How entertaining.

00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:30.084
I know you're all wise.

00:15:30.543 --> 00:15:32.628
If I say anymore,

00:15:32.753 --> 00:15:34.589
it'll become an earful, right?

00:15:54.483 --> 00:15:55.693
Your employees

00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.946
appeared at my construction site.

00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.114
Why?

00:16:03.326 --> 00:16:06.996
Because they think the body's
buried there.

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:12.209
From the last time.

00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:15.546
Shoot.

00:16:16.422 --> 00:16:18.090
Still going on about that?

00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:20.801
I shouldn't be worried then.

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:40.446
Moving it could be
shooting myself in the foot.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.702
Give a plausible excuse

00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:49.997
to stop the construction.

00:16:50.122 --> 00:16:51.165
Remember the boys we used

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.335
before the redevelopment began?

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.795
The illegal immigrants.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.963
Yes.

00:16:57.046 --> 00:16:58.089
Should I call them?

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:02.259
Grind it on the spot.

00:17:10.142 --> 00:17:11.268
Hello.

00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:18.192
Mr. Seo?

00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:20.361
Prosecutor Kim.

00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:28.035
Are you drunk?

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:30.037
Yes.

00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:34.333
5 servings of pork belly.

00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:36.544
By yourself?

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:41.257
I feel like dying,

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:44.260
but I can't stop craving meat.

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:48.931
Did you really decide to
work at the construction site?

00:17:49.056 --> 00:17:50.808
Did they hire someone like you?

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.564
Bluetooth camcorder. Transmitter.

00:17:56.689 --> 00:17:57.481
Oh.

00:17:57.606 --> 00:17:59.650
A metal detector just in case.

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:04.780
Shoot.

00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:07.033
This could really kill you.

00:18:07.158 --> 00:18:09.744
I better have it out
with the judge in charge.

00:18:11.704 --> 00:18:12.747
You see,

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:16.083
when I went to the construction...

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:17.626
When I checked it out,

00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:19.795
you don't have to bury it
in the ground.

00:18:20.504 --> 00:18:21.881
You could put the body
in the wall

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:24.717
cement it.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.553
The wall?

00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:32.433
But there are dozens of buildings.

00:18:33.142 --> 00:18:35.035
If we assume it's buried
between two walls in one house,

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.855
there are 7 or 8 houses
on one floor.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.190
14.

00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:41.025
16.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.527
If we assume there is
one building per complex...

00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:49.033
So unless we can specify
the location,

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:53.245
I must get a warrant...

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:56.415
A warrant to tear down
the whole construction site.

00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:58.292
That's what we need.

00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:01.045
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes?

00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:06.801
When will you ever get
to experience this again?

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.971
Are you saying...

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.933
Do you want more meat?

00:19:14.892 --> 00:19:15.935
Yes.

00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:19.021
Shoot.

00:19:21.357 --> 00:19:22.399
Shoot.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.443
Damn it.

00:19:57.101 --> 00:19:59.353
Nam Wan-seong, you son of a gun!

00:20:14.785 --> 00:20:15.870
Gosh, so tired.

00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:22.293
Among the redevelopment
company's charges,

00:20:22.418 --> 00:20:23.794
corrupted bidding,

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:25.504
violation of increment contract,

00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:26.940
and the inspection
companies' collusion.

00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:29.341
Those three are assigned to us.

00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:30.968
You mean
Ehong Construction's case?

00:20:31.093 --> 00:20:34.054
Those three are the core charges.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.347
What is the 9th floor doing?

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:37.224
I thought they were going to
take care of it.

00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:39.393
They said it was too much
and asked me to share it.

00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:42.688
Prosecutor Choi?

00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:47.067
Me? But the 9th floor never...

00:20:49.278 --> 00:20:50.321
Okay.

00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:08.589
Shoot. It's damn solid.

00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:12.885
So? Is this working?

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.303
Yes, it's working fine.

00:21:14.428 --> 00:21:16.472
We can see you,
so show us the walls.

00:21:21.769 --> 00:21:24.939
Can you show me
inside the balcony?

00:21:25.606 --> 00:21:27.775
Mr. Seo,
can you go to the balcony?

00:21:27.899 --> 00:21:29.192
The balcony. Got it.

00:21:38.744 --> 00:21:41.580
Did you say it was done
by people who don't build?

00:21:41.704 --> 00:21:42.497
Yes.

00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:44.750
They're all thugs. Ex-cons.

00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:46.627
Then they wouldn't build the wall.

00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:48.629
It's easier to dig a hole
and bury it there.

00:21:49.672 --> 00:21:51.173
Is it harder to bury it
in the wall?

00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:54.051
Not just hard.

00:21:54.176 --> 00:21:56.512
If you put something
inside the wall,

00:21:56.637 --> 00:21:59.348
you have to even the edge
and the surface.

00:21:59.473 --> 00:22:00.766
So you can't see what's inside.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.939
Mr. Seo, can you go out
and show me the ground?

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:09.357
Okay. The ground.

00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:11.986
If it's buried in the ground,

00:22:12.111 --> 00:22:14.780
can you tell from the screen?

00:22:14.905 --> 00:22:16.508
It's easy for builders like me.

00:22:16.532 --> 00:22:18.075
It's easy for builders like me.
Hwang.

00:22:18.492 --> 00:22:19.743
Are you slacking off again?

00:22:19.868 --> 00:22:21.620
You think you're out here
for a walk?

00:22:21.745 --> 00:22:22.745
Hwang?
Your phone!

00:22:22.788 --> 00:22:24.290
Your phone!

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:26.141
You never return
when I give you work, geez.

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:29.086
If I catch you slacking off again,
you're fired. Got it?

00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:30.337
Get back to work.

00:22:31.171 --> 00:22:32.214
Hwang.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.508
Don't forget to take that
with you.

00:22:37.553 --> 00:22:40.514
No Hwang. It's Captain.

00:23:31.565 --> 00:23:34.109
May I have your attention please.

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:38.864
Due to the safety check,

00:23:38.989 --> 00:23:42.701
we're closed for tomorrow.

00:23:42.826 --> 00:23:46.163
We advise you to put
your machines and tools away

00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:50.042
before you leave.

00:23:50.876 --> 00:23:52.560
Please prevent
the insufficient arrangement

00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:55.214
from interrupting
the safety check.

00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:56.756
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:58.801
I repeat.

00:23:59.551 --> 00:24:00.803
Due to the safety check...

00:24:00.927 --> 00:24:04.640
This has never happened before.

00:24:04.765 --> 00:24:06.266
Even if there's a safety check,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.185
we can work here
while they check there.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.229
My goodness.

00:24:10.354 --> 00:24:12.856
I know.
How big is this safety check

00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:14.858
that they shut down
the whole construction?

00:24:14.982 --> 00:24:17.736
If it's done without notice,
does it mean there's a problem?

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.488
- A problem?
- Yes.

00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:21.448
Oh, whatever.

00:24:21.573 --> 00:24:22.908
Just do as they say.

00:24:29.623 --> 00:24:30.916
This is the one

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.835
and only chance.

00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:34.938
If Nam Wan-seong is taking action,

00:24:34.962 --> 00:24:36.463
he'll lead us
to where the body is

00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:38.132
even before we find it.

00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:40.007
If we miss it,

00:24:40.134 --> 00:24:42.177
our only physical evidence
disappears for good.

00:24:42.678 --> 00:24:44.178
The winner will be Nam Wan-seong.

00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:46.658
I'm on my way.
Prosecutor Kim,
cover Nam Wan-seong.

00:24:46.682 --> 00:24:48.349
Prosecutor Kim,
cover Nam Wan-seong.

00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:50.120
You must arrest him
as soon as the body's found.

00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:52.104
He wouldn't come here himself
to dig the ground.

00:24:52.187 --> 00:24:53.187
And I can't arrest him.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.457
What are you going to do
by yourself?

00:24:54.481 --> 00:24:56.650
I'm not alone.
I'm going to make a report.

00:24:56.775 --> 00:24:58.735
Once we check that I wasn't wrong,

00:24:58.861 --> 00:25:00.070
call the police immediately.

00:25:00.195 --> 00:25:01.780
- Prosecutor Sung.
- No.

00:25:01.904 --> 00:25:04.074
- What?
- Leave him alone.

00:25:04.199 --> 00:25:06.994
He already has enough
on his plate as it is now.

00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:20.048
What are you doing?

00:25:20.716 --> 00:25:21.967
Mr. Seo is alone.

00:25:22.092 --> 00:25:24.261
We never know who he has to
deal with and when.

00:25:25.471 --> 00:25:27.181
I will go. I should,

00:25:27.598 --> 00:25:30.309
but what if the body's really
found there tonight?

00:25:30.434 --> 00:25:32.019
Then who found it?

00:25:32.143 --> 00:25:34.037
The person who worked
at the construction site.

00:25:34.062 --> 00:25:35.397
But

00:25:35.522 --> 00:25:38.941
Seo Dong-jae and Nam Wan-seong had
the disclosure battle.

00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:41.527
So the moment his name
is involved in this case,

00:25:41.653 --> 00:25:43.530
the prosecutor held grudges

00:25:43.655 --> 00:25:45.324
and pretended to be
a construction worker

00:25:45.407 --> 00:25:48.326
to go after the man who revealed
his flaws from the past.

00:25:48.452 --> 00:25:51.413
Don't you think people would
say that, Prosecutor Kim Ji-hee?

00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:54.666
Why are you questioning that now?

00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:56.084
No.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.879
I'm not questioning.
I'm just concerned.

00:26:02.758 --> 00:26:04.801
Now, are you ready to set off?

00:26:07.304 --> 00:26:08.722
Aren't you in a rush? Let's go.

00:26:17.856 --> 00:26:23.070
(Ehong Construction Cheongju
District 5 Redevelopment)

00:26:28.033 --> 00:26:29.076
Do you see it?

00:26:29.117 --> 00:26:31.036
Yes. You.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.918
We're only going to watch.

00:26:38.418 --> 00:26:39.418
Yes.

00:26:39.461 --> 00:26:41.022
Even if they move the body
before the police arrive,

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.172
we're only tailing them.

00:26:43.674 --> 00:26:44.716
Can you fight?

00:26:45.133 --> 00:26:46.969
I've never tried. You?

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.388
Just tail them then.

00:26:54.393 --> 00:26:56.812
Kim Ji-hee can probably fight
better than us.

00:26:57.437 --> 00:27:01.149
Maybe I should've told her
to come here instead.

00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:02.442
So she gets hurt again?

00:27:02.568 --> 00:27:04.194
What are you saying?

00:27:06.113 --> 00:27:07.656
No way. Are you

00:27:07.781 --> 00:27:09.658
trying to look chivalrous?

00:27:10.117 --> 00:27:11.159
Hey.

00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:18.792
So you sent her to a less
dangerous place, isn't it?

00:27:23.338 --> 00:27:25.299
Do you really think
that's less dangerous?

00:27:53.118 --> 00:27:54.494
It's freezing.

00:27:57.205 --> 00:27:58.725
We haven't seen anything
for two hours.

00:27:58.749 --> 00:28:00.751
Why did you have to bring me
to this place? Geez.

00:28:03.378 --> 00:28:04.588
What's this?

00:28:04.713 --> 00:28:05.756
A hot pack?

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.926
Gosh, you have so many.

00:28:10.469 --> 00:28:13.388
Give me one more.

00:28:13.513 --> 00:28:15.349
- I'm freezing here, seriously.
- Shush.

00:29:07.109 --> 00:29:08.402
Hey, turn the power on.

00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:15.659
Remove everything here.

00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:17.494
The power.

00:29:31.091 --> 00:29:32.217
I knew it was there.

00:29:37.514 --> 00:29:39.558
It's certainly not a safety check.

00:29:42.811 --> 00:29:44.855
Take it out and show me.

00:29:48.358 --> 00:29:49.526
What's that?

00:29:49.651 --> 00:29:50.694
What?

00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:56.408
- A grinder?
- Are they grinding it?

00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:57.576
Over here.

00:29:58.076 --> 00:29:59.119
Here.

00:30:07.794 --> 00:30:08.837
Move this.

00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:17.345
Stop.

00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:23.977
Take it out.

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:32.986
- A body.
- It's a body.

00:30:35.697 --> 00:30:36.990
That's not all.

00:30:37.115 --> 00:30:38.992
Don't leave any piece behind.

00:30:39.117 --> 00:30:40.285
Find them all.

00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:43.997
They're not just moving the body.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.583
In there.

00:30:51.296 --> 00:30:53.006
If they grind it

00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:56.259
and scatter it in the woods or
the river, we can never trace it.

00:30:56.384 --> 00:30:57.636
Stay here.

00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:58.637
What are you going to do?

00:30:58.762 --> 00:31:01.723
Call the police.
And call Prosecutor Kim too.

00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:05.977
You're not the boss of me.
Where are you going?

00:31:07.312 --> 00:31:08.814
What's he going to do?

00:31:23.203 --> 00:31:25.205
Shoot.

00:31:31.044 --> 00:31:33.964
Do that first and pick it up.

00:31:48.353 --> 00:31:50.272
Shoot. What the hell?

00:31:50.397 --> 00:31:51.439
What now?

00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:56.903
What the hell?

00:31:57.863 --> 00:31:59.239
What's wrong with this?

00:32:02.242 --> 00:32:05.745
Is the power unstable
because it's not completed yet?

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.874
You. Go check the power.

00:32:09.958 --> 00:32:11.668
Hey, you.

00:32:11.793 --> 00:32:13.879
There's a generator behind
the container. Bring it.

00:32:30.896 --> 00:32:32.147
Hey.

00:32:32.272 --> 00:32:34.149
It's back on. Get to work.

00:32:46.453 --> 00:32:47.746
Mr. Seo, they...

00:32:55.462 --> 00:32:56.504

The other one?

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:11.311

what's going on, do you?

00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:35.168
I'm sorry.

Partner?

00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:42.342
Come out.

your partner will die.

He won't come out. Forget it.

00:33:55.647 --> 00:33:56.731
Grab him.

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.485
Wait.

No.

Thank you for plucking up
your courage.

Courage?

00:38:12.402 --> 00:38:16.658
It's not that I'm courageous.

00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:19.327
I'm not educated.

00:38:19.452 --> 00:38:21.496
So I spent my whole life
in construction sites.

00:38:22.205 --> 00:38:24.832
That's how I fed my children,
got them dressed,

00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:26.751
and sent them to school.

00:38:27.377 --> 00:38:30.505
This isn't how constructions
should be done.

00:39:36.237 --> 00:39:37.822
Yes, he was my secretary.

worked for me.

I didn't deny that.

00:39:42.243 --> 00:39:45.704
But how can you say I ordered them

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.915
to kill a man and bury the body?

00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:49.208
It doesn't make any sense.

00:39:50.168 --> 00:39:52.587
If your employees cause
trouble outside,

00:39:52.712 --> 00:39:54.672
is it considered your order?

that I ordered them?

I wonder how you can blame me

00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:05.975
for killing a man

00:40:06.934 --> 00:40:08.186
I've never met before.

00:40:10.646 --> 00:40:11.689
Nam Wan-seong.

00:40:13.191 --> 00:40:15.068
What did you do
on May 2 this year?

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.405
May 2? When was that?

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.615
I'm not sure.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.992
I don't know. How am I supposed
to remember that?

00:40:23.117 --> 00:40:24.952
That's more than half a year ago.

00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:28.581
On May 3, you suddenly
closed the construction site.

00:40:28.706 --> 00:40:29.999
Why did you do that?

00:40:30.124 --> 00:40:31.793
I'm not boasting here,

00:40:32.626 --> 00:40:34.337
but I was accused

00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:37.006
of faulty construction.
How was I supposed to keep going?

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.093
Besides,

00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:45.598
if I were to kill someone
and bury him,

00:40:46.432 --> 00:40:48.160
you think I'd bury him
in my construction site?

00:40:48.184 --> 00:40:49.936
Then I'd be the first
to be suspected.

00:40:51.062 --> 00:40:52.664
It's all mountains
behind that construction site.

00:40:52.688 --> 00:40:54.690
I'd bury him there
unless I was an idiot.

00:41:00.363 --> 00:41:01.447
Why didn't you?

00:41:03.282 --> 00:41:04.617
Because I didn't kill him.

00:41:06.535 --> 00:41:08.788
Moving a body was harder
than you thought, no?

00:41:08.913 --> 00:41:10.391
I don't know.
I've never tried it before.

00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:13.333
You never know what might happen
until you reach the mountain,

00:41:13.459 --> 00:41:14.728
and because it's out
of your reach,

00:41:14.752 --> 00:41:16.546
you're worried about
when it might be found.

00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:18.505
You had acres of land
in your control.

00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:20.007
Why bother climbing the mountain?

00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:21.217
Wait.

00:41:21.926 --> 00:41:23.636
Do you call this an investigation?

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.097
You're putting words in his mouth.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.276
Imagine how much he struggled
in there.

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:41.779
He tried to yell for help although
he couldn't make any sound.

00:41:41.904 --> 00:41:44.657
The cement dough got in his throat

00:41:44.782 --> 00:41:47.243
and hardened in his eyes.

00:41:48.995 --> 00:41:50.413
What jerks.

00:41:51.205 --> 00:41:54.375
How could one do that to a man?

00:41:54.499 --> 00:41:56.836
So go catch them.

00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.963
You've seen those three.

00:41:59.088 --> 00:42:00.255
They're the perpetrators.

00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:02.508
Why are you wasting your time
on me?

00:42:03.217 --> 00:42:05.011
I'm the victim here.

00:42:05.136 --> 00:42:07.680
Have me sit here for 365 days

00:42:07.805 --> 00:42:09.265
and see if I say anything.

00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:11.559
I know nothing.

00:42:12.518 --> 00:42:14.645
Seriously.

00:42:15.605 --> 00:42:17.106
This is frustrating to death.

00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:24.213
The whistleblower who reported
that the CEO of Ehong Construction

00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:25.823
gave orders to make
double blueprints

00:42:26.823 --> 00:42:28.467
and conspired
with the inspection company

00:42:28.493 --> 00:42:31.412
to siphon 11 million dollars

00:42:32.205 --> 00:42:34.207
was found buried alive

00:42:34.332 --> 00:42:36.125
in Ehong's construction site.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.211
But you know nothing about it?

00:42:38.336 --> 00:42:39.378
Correct.

00:42:49.262 --> 00:42:51.516
He needs to be transferred.
Send me the guards.

00:42:52.891 --> 00:42:54.268
Where is he being transferred to?

00:42:56.771 --> 00:42:59.040
I bet you didn't feel comfortable
in our detention center

00:42:59.065 --> 00:43:00.441
because it was only temporary.

00:43:00.566 --> 00:43:02.068
I'll send you to your friends.

00:43:03.236 --> 00:43:04.654
What do you mean friends?

00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:07.406
Jail in Cheongju Police Station.

00:43:08.407 --> 00:43:11.285
The detectives are
dying to see you.

00:43:11.953 --> 00:43:13.371
You won't be bored.

00:43:15.288 --> 00:43:17.208
Oh, see you again.

00:43:21.504 --> 00:43:24.298
(Cheongju Police Station)

00:43:53.327 --> 00:43:55.496
How many years do you think
I'll be in here for?

00:43:56.247 --> 00:43:57.290
Ten days.

00:43:58.624 --> 00:44:00.293
It's a maximum of 10 days in jail.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.171
You know how many years
you'll rot in there.

00:44:04.295 --> 00:44:05.880
As many as your sins.

00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:08.968
That all depends on
how much evidence you have.

00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:11.594
How much you gathered.

00:44:12.722 --> 00:44:14.140
Was there anything to gather?

00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:21.981
I'll tell you in court.

00:44:26.402 --> 00:44:28.696
I hope there is something
you can tell me.
