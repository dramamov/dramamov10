(The Nine Soul Bridge)

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.759
What's wrong, Li Motong?

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.719
Are you cold?

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.520
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.679
You wouldn't be suffering like this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.079
if it weren't for me.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.920
It's all my fault.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.520
I should've trusted you.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.119
I should've loved you.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:12.959
You Zimei.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.599
You Zimei must have a way.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
Wait here.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.400
I'll be back.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.760
Don't go…

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.480
Yan…

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.079
Yan…

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.159
Miss You!

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.159
Miss You!

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.480
He's wracked with agonizing pain
from the Mei pearl's recoil.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.519
Miss You!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.280
Can you save him? Please!

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.159
You Zimei!

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.000
You Zimei!

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.879
You Zimei!

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.920
How's Li Motong?

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.519
He…

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.199
he's hurting badly.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.510
Please, I'm begging you, save him.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.879
You don't blame me?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.960
I don't.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.560
Just save him.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.800
Please save him.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.960
There is a way,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.879
but you'll have to go

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.390
to an extremely dangerous place.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.120
Will you

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.759
go there?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.199
I will.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.000
If it means saving him,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.400
I'll go through blades and fire,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.080
thunder and storms,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.280
even down to the deepest abyss.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.490
I've restored the dream disc.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.590
Inside the dream realm,
there's a thousand-year-old Bodhi Tree.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.590
Its Bodhi Fruit can ease
the suffering of the afflicted heart.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.400
Miss Lu,

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.080
if you will risk everything for him,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.240
follow me

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.280
into the dream disc.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.290
Once inside the dream realm,

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.670
you must cross the Nine Soul Bridge

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.080
to obtain the Bodhi Fruit.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.960
On that bridge,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.120
all your past and present lives
will be revealed.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.759
If your soul falters while crossing,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.560
you'll be consumed

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080
by agony beyond bearing.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.159
You're mortal

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.319
and already wounded all over.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.759
Lu Huayan,

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.080
are you sure

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.159
you want to cross the bridge?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.520
I will.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.280
I'll get the Bodhi Fruit.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:43.800
I'll save him.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.599
Lu Huayan,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.560
you think
you can cross the Nine Soul Bridge?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.000
Those who defy fate
will have their souls torn apart.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.950
Go back to the Mortal Realm
while you still can.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.280
If you keep going,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.199
you won't just fail to save him.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.080
You'll destroy yourself too.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.719
Who are you?

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.599
You won't challenge my resolve.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.319
I will cross this bridge.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.279
I will save Li Motong!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.800
Have you forgotten
your sister's tragic death?

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.519
She died so horribly,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.680
yet you're the one who lived.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.680
Why was it you who survived,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.560
and not her?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.319
(Lu Huayan,)

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.480
(may you face your heart's trial)

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.079
(and cross the Nine Soul Bridge.)

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:41.879
Yan.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.000
Yan.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.519
Sister,

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.759
is it you?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.160
Yan,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.360
ignore those treacherous voices.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.480
I've met an unfortunate end,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.079
but it wasn't by your hand.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.720
You shouldn't blame yourself,

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.879
or drown in guilt because of me.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.199
It was my fault.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:10.920
It's my fault,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.720
Sister.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.759
If I hadn't been weak and useless,

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.480
if I could've protected you,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.120
you wouldn't have died.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.920
It should've been me.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.199
Not you.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.600
Silly girl.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.370
You already did everything you could

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.959
to protect me.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.959
We grew up together.
We relied on each other for everything.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.800
The joy,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.879
companionship,

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.970
and protection you gave me

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:36.759
can't be measured in time.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.519
The fact that you exist in this world,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.319
that you became my sister,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.079
is already the greatest gift
you could give me.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.920
Sister,

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.879
do you really

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.920
mean it?

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.040
Yan,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.279
I want you to live on.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.160
If you want me to rest in peace,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.399
promise me

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.480
you'll step out
of the shadows of the past.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.040
Yan,

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.680
live on.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.120
Sister,

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.959
I miss you…

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.000
Sister!

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:26.759
Sister!

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.279
Sister…

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.800
Sister…

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.639
I will live.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.720
I'll live well, for you.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.279
I can do it.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.920
(I can save you.)

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.560
Sister,

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.480
thank you.
