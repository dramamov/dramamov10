00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.250
Chief.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.190
Just a little longer.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.250
C-Chief!

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.800
- Chief!
- Come on.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.630
I'd like to have some piece of mind.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.870
Even if just for a second, please!

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.540
What is this? Hey. Turn the car around.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.440
Turn the car!

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.750
Hey,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.050
why do I have to climb over the wall of my own police station?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.470
This is all because of you guys!

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.180
What am I? Some high school student or something?

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.000
No. Team Leader,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.030
the location of the incident was in Seoul, and this is Incheon.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.610
It's in their jurisdiction. Why would we take the case?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.160
Our detectives didn't go knowing there would be an incident. It was a coincidence

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.330
because Director Cheon Na Na invited the detectives.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.810
No! Team Leader? Team Leader!

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.240
What did they say?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.750
They're saying, "Why should we take the case

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.780
when there were two detectives that saw the incident at the time?"

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.780
To summarize, "It's a headache, so who cares about jurisdiction? You guys take the blame."

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.910
That's what they're saying!

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.630
Has the cause for Mrs. Cheon Na Na's collapse been discovered?

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.710
Yes, the hospital revealed that she collapsed
[Anchor Kang Seok Hoon | News Today]

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.600
due to hypoglycemic shock caused by insulin overdose.
[Reporter Park Jae Beon | Incheon West Police Station]

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.270
So are they saying the person who administered the medication made a mistake?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.590
It seems like we have to wait for the investigation results

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.870
to see if it was an accident or if it was intentional.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.480
Are you saying that there's a possibility that somebody purposefully caused the overdose?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.660
According to forensic scientists, there have been real cases in foreign countries

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.690
where crimes using insulin have occurred.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.190
By the way, why is this case being compared to those foreign cases?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.050
It's because of the content of the interview that Mrs. Cheon Na Na did for a WCN broadcast.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
The reason why former chairman Cheon Seong Dae had to go through the trial while implicated for corruption,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.340
was actually because I reported it.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.490
And Chairman Cheon Sang Woo's crime was also

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.740
revealed because I handed over decisive evidence to the investigative agency.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.830
This case has been given to the West Incheon police force, who revealed Chairman Cheon Sang Woo's crime

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.110
in commissioning and abetting a murder.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.740
What is the decisive evidence that Mrs. Cheon Na Na revealed in the interview?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.250
And how is it related to Mrs. Cheon Na Na's incident?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.020
Incheon West Station is yet to come up with an answer.
[Cheon Na Na reported crimes of former and current TJ chairman]

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.610
What

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.160
kind of answer do we have to give?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.390
We have no answer to give yet, but there's an answer that Cheon Na Na sent.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.530
You know the reason why you were sentenced to jail, right?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.740
I handed over the data to the Blue House.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.750
You really want to die by my hands, don't you?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.050
I'll tell you straightforwardly,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.070
I'm scared of you.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.410
I'm scared that

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.400
you would really kill me.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.300
That's the end.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.930
I told you it was a personal request!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.870
I was in danger of looking suspicious.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.060
There wasn't any other way.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.150
What about the results?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.430
Did you tell them?

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.300
The reason she sent that file to us

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.300
is to say, "Cheon Seong Dae made this happen to kill Cheon Na Na."

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.340
So she's telling us to arrest Cheon Seong Dae. That's what she means.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.020
Yes, that's it.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.820
Detective Oh, do you really think Cheon Seong Dae tried to kill Cheon Na Na?

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.040
No.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.560
We need to view this as her using tricks similar to those used when she killed Woo Tae Ho.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.080
She's going at it with her life on the line.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.840
There's a high possibility that this is Cheon Na Na's manipulation.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.150
Yes.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.180
Her inviting us there to see the incident

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.450
was all part of her plan.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.740
She purposefully involved us in this case.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.370
So then, we can act like this never happened.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.850
We can ignore it.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.210
No. We don't need to throw away the knife that Cheon Na Na gave us for attacking Cheon Seong Dae.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.510
We just need to aim that knife at Cheon Seong Dae per Cheon Na Na's intention.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.550
For now, we pressure Cheon Seong Dae, and get him on our side.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.270
He'll definitely be helpful for our investigation.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.070
Are you close with Cheon Seong Dae?

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.590
Do you think he's some great person who comes

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.440
and goes, just because we tell him to?

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.920
I agree. I think the chief's right.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.450
What you're saying is that we'll be messing with Cheon Seong Dae.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.440
Don't you think the possibility of that is a bit unrealistic?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.380
Cheon Seong Dae is on an entirely new level compared to Cheon Na Na and Cheon Sang Woo.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.930
The connections he's made with the people in politics throughout his career

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.110
are probably more than we can imagine.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.630
We can't deal with even a single person from his connections.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.910
If Cheon Seong Dae makes a move, we're basically flies.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.020
It's not just the flies that would die.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.260
The family of the flies would be annihilated as well.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.750
Well,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.880
I guess I admit you're right in some aspects.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.590
In the worst case, this might lead to all of us losing our jobs.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.100
You admit that, right?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.270
Okay.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.200
Then there's only one thing for us to do.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.010
Stay still.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.650
All of you guys, don't come to work.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.030
I'll still pay you.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.780
Stay in the corner of your houses,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.170
and look at the wall and zone out like a stone Buddha statue.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.420
What do you think? It's easy, right?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.970
Chief, we should at least keep pushing forward in the Cheon Na Na case.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.070
There's already evidence that allows us to be suspicious of Cheon Na Na.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.930
Hey!

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.280
Hey.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.850
Violent Crime Division Team 2, my dear boneheads.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.500
Please, I'm begging you.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.200
I...

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.650
want nothing at all.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.870
All I want...!

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.390
Only one.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.510
Peace of mind.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.250
Peace!

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.230
Please!

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.040
I'll

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.070
put my Gangnam building on the line.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.350
If we get to a situation where everyone will be fired, I'll divide that Gangnam building into eight.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.310
Do you really have to...

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.980
Y-You don't really have to...

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.120
A situation where everyone gets fired won't come anyway.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.240
I'm confident.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.600
What are you talking about? It might be easier than we think.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.790
If we keep pushing forward like Detective Oh wants, we'll be fired right away, don't you think, Chief?

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.590
In this case,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.580
I don't think there's anything to lose, no matter what the outcome is.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.770
I'm sorry.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.160
I don't think I can accept your proposition.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.460
And the reason?

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.360
The current state is not something I can come forth into and solve.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.170
Okay, I see your point of view,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:27.180
but how's the McQueen headquarters viewing this situation?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.470
They're hoping we'll change up our management team?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.030
Yes.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.200
"Push director Cheon Na Na as the new CEO."

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.260
Why didn't you burn it? Why?

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.500
I just want to know

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.050
what was going to become of that.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.260
Just out of curiosity?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.360
Gi Jin, I told you already.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.570
If it gets discovered, we can't get the money

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.300
and that we have to puke back up the money that we already got!

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.640
Do you know why Gi Dong Jae was holding onto that?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.180
It was to get money out of Cheon Na Na.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.060
Gi Dong Jae is dead.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.770
Now we have a chance to take his share.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.220
Now do you see?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.640
I've put my whole life on the line.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.040
The end is either one or the other.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.730
Die from banging our head on the prison bars, or live buried in a pile of money.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.180
So,

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.040
how are you going to deal with the West Incheon guys?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.000
You said that they got the forensics report too.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.370
I...

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.230
came all this way because I trusted you.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.390
You need to lead me forward

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.440
to the very end.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.440
TJ is in Cheon Na Na's hands,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.440
and Cheon Sang Woo can't recover.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.420
Cheon Sang Woo. Involve him once more.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.520
How?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.160
What you found out... open it all up.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.130
Open it and ruin him.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.680
The traffic crimes investigation division was hiding these.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.440
Now it's certain that Cheon Na Na's fingerprints were found on the driver-side seat belt.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.340
How did you get this? They wouldn't have given it to you easily.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.140
Of course, they didn't. We made a fuss there.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.390
We forced open the cabinets to look in them,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.010
and it got pretty physical too.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.740
What are you going to do if they make that a problem later on?

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.100
What are we to be afraid of? We'd be building owners if we get fired anyway.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.370
We made a big scene on purpose.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.570
So that they'd tell the higher-ups and get us fired.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.280
We should've gone, too, so we could all get fired immediately.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.870
I know, right?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.680
Stop overdoing it, you idiots, please.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.510
Here. On Jeong Hui Joo's clothing,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.310
Cheon Na Na's blood was found,

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.260
and even her fingerprints were found in the car.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.580
Then,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.610
does this mean Cheon Na Na

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.850
killed Jeong Hui Joo and Woo Tae Ho... both?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.060
It's "could've killed," not "killed" yet.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.260
Well then, she could've killed both,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.720
or killed one of the two,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.920
or might not have killed either. Is that what you're saying?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.360
I mean,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.280
we should decide on a direction for the investigation. That'd help strengthen it.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.090
In what direction should we be going?

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.450
To find Jeong Hui Joo's things, Jang Gi Jin

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.830
even tried to harm Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.120
It's probably because he was afraid Cheon Na Na's blood would be found.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.960
If that blood had nothing to do with Jeong Hui Joo's murder, he wouldn't have gone so far.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.450
That's right.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.430
Killing Gi Dong Jae to get rid of the evidence is also in the same vein, right?

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.770
If Cheon Na Na murdered Jeong Hui Joo,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.380
the motive for Woo Tae Ho is naturally solved.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.600
Woo Tae Ho knew the truth,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.880
and to hide that, she killed him.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.620
Then what's Cheon Na Na's motive for murdering Jeong Hui Joo?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.160
Is it simply because of the affair she had with her husband?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.070
Does Cheon Na Na seem like someone who would do that?

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.290
Well, it's not like we don't have evidence.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.190
Why don't we call in Cheon Na Na and question her for now?

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.810
Hey, if we do that,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.620
it's the same as saying Cheon Sang Woo, who we put in jail, is not the culprit who ordered the murder.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.580
If Cheon Na Na killed Jeong Hui Joo

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.760
Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.190
If Gi Dong Jae didn't kill her, Cheon Sang Woo would be innocent.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.480
It becomes very complicated.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.340
My gosh, but we can't avoid making a move with this much evidence.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.900
Yes?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.960
Yes, I understand. We'll be waiting.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.450
Team Leader.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.880
- Cheon Na Na is coming.
- What?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.770
Why?

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.040
I notified her lawyer that we needed the victim's testimony,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.770
but she said she'd come in person and testify herself.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.990
[The People's Police, A Righteous Republic of Korea]

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.550
Why is she saying she will come and personally testify?

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.770
Does she mean to get Cheon Seong Dae arrested?

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.240
No. She probably knows that's impossible.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.300
Then why?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.710
Her intentions are simple.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:13.170
On the one hand, to protect herself. On the other, crisis management.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.020
Did you think I would understand you if you said it like that? Say it simply, simply, and in an easy way.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.420
She hit us in the eye in case she'd get hit first.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.300
She's also trying to put a leash on us in case she's found out.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.040
Good. Now I understand you clearly.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.070
She's no joke when it comes to playing tricks.

[Incheon West Police Station]

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.250
By any chance, can we record your testimony?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.500
Yes, you may.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.090
Then we'll now begin to record your testimony.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.270
Record it.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.730
- How are you feeling?
- Where's her confidence coming from?

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.020
I'm much better.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.990
We investigated the hospital.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.300
There was nothing suspicious that was found during the drug handling process.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.880
That means the insulin injector was tampered with

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.470
while in your possession.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.480
It was switched in the office. That means someone entered my office.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.140
In that case, it's probably one of the company's employees.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.010
It's probably an action under the direction of someone who can order that employee around.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.260
If it's an inside job, it won't be easy to solve the crime.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.850
Since Detective Oh is on the case, don't you think you'll capture the culprit soon enough?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.860
Is that why you invited us to the event?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.390
"Capture them since you saw it clearly with your own eyes."

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.260
By any chance, are you suspecting me?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.860
Are you saying that I deliberately put enough medicine into my body to kill me?

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.740
We encounter various people while working in this profession.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.850
There are some that are impossible to understand

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.960
by the average person's standards.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.150
Is the investigation difficult? You're making strange excuses.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.030
Yes, it's an excuse.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.340
You see, the suspect is so high-ranked that it's hard to approach them.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.060
I'll do my best to cooperate. This is the person who tried to kill me.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.710
You must catch the person, no matter who it is.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:33.150
Yes, but we only have situational evidence for this case, so unless we find direct evidence─

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.180
I believe.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.760
You're the people who brought a conglomerate chairman to the stand.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.840
Due to that belief, I cooperated with Detective Oh's investigation,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.260
even though I knew it was illegal.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.290
You used a shortcut called "search and seizure,"

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.150
to deliberately make a piece of admissible evidence.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.410
I didn't know then, but I knew later on,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.100
that there was a problem in the acquisition of the evidence.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.700
If that had been revealed during the second part of my brother's trial, I think it would've become a problem.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.590
She's here to threaten us.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.440
Should we keep recording?

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.310
Let's keep watching for now. See how far she'll go.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.030
It will be a problem.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.300
Worst case, Chairman Cheon Sang Woo might be released after being found not guilty.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.200
You don't want that either, right?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.370
You misunderstand me a bit. I understand, though.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:31.980
There are some things I said that were distorted from the truth.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.580
What things?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.460
I apologize.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.820
I only thought of myself. So,

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.490
I think I made you guys look at the situation in the wrong direction.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.330
I regretted not being able to step in

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.580
and stop him, even after hearing my brother saying to kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:07.330
Even on the day of the incident, I reached out to Jeong Hui Joo and asked her to meet with me.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.520
I should've told her, but I couldn't.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.320
Maybe

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.040
I did want Jeong Hui Joo to die.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.070
Because she's the woman who stole my husband away from me.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.710
I suffered so much.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:38.090
Because if I had told her sooner, Jeong Hui Joo wouldn't have died.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.300
Because of that guilt, I tried to die with Tae Ho.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.110
Tae Ho didn't try to commit suicide.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.370
I...

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.200
I wanted to die with him.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.410
After being the only one who survived, I thought the only thing I could do

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.280
was to reveal the culprit who killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.880
So...

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.200
so, that's why I helped you.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.770
You said you met with Jeong Hui Joo on the day of the murder. And nothing else happened?

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.540
No, nothing happened. I sent her off after we spoke.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.080
The reason why you didn't say this early on... Is it because you were afraid

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.180
that you might become a suspect?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.650
I didn't think that way.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.240
I just

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.300
couldn't dare talk about it because of the guilt

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.070
that I ignored the situation around Jeong Hui Joo.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.560
And it's not because you couldn't remember?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.120
No.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.140
Memories can be manipulated without your knowledge.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.360
Due to being so shocked, you remember the situation to your advantage.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.710
Are there such cases?

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.160
By any chance, did it happen to you?

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.400
You say you saw who killed your father, right?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.330
But maybe you didn't see him.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.870
You were scared and afraid. Maybe you're confusing yourself, thinking you saw them when you actually didn't.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.450
That's right.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:25.540
I changed the truth to my liking. I manipulated it to a truth that it fits.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.570
Like you.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.820
I'm busy these days. The company is in crisis.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.380
There's no one else to step in but me.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.690
After today, I won't have the time to deal with you.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.610
That's why I came here with difficulty to speak with you.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:52.230
I hope I won't have to concern myself with this in the future.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.150
To be honest, I think everything Cheon Na Na said is true.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.770
That's usually the case.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.580
When you listen, you just believe her right away. It's a story she made up by putting things together.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.050
If that was her acting, then that's amazing.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.370
This won't be easy.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.940
Honestly, if she talks like that in court, we don't have any evidence to refute her.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.100
Any detective would believe her with these acting skills.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.150
I mean, the blood that was on Jeong Hui Joo's clothing hasn't been brought up yet.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.790
Should we have opened that up and pushed her further?

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.200
Jang Gi Jin knows that the blood results are in our hands anyway.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.540
Then Cheon Na Na will find out too. I mean, aren't we just giving time for her to prepare?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.970
For now, it's better for us to act like we believe her.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.020
What Cheon Na Na really wants is to have TJ in her hands.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.700
"If it gets in the way of that,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.580
I won't stand back, no matter who it is."

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.270
She was here to let us know that.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.540
In the worst case, we might create another victim.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.850
I mean, she is a woman who accuses her own father as a murderer.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.010
Is there anything she wouldn't do?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.330
Hello. Which one of you is Detective Sim Dong Wook?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.720
- It's me.
- Hereby, you are arrested for bribery and breach of trust.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.350
Excuse me?

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.570
Let go. What good would it do for you to hold on? Let go.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.340
- Hey!
- Let go!

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.740
Sim Dong Il. That's your brother, right?

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.820
Yes.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.510
What does Sim Dong Il do?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.370
What does he do to earn money?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.150
Why are you asking that?

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.140
He's jobless, right?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.130
Look here. You dragged me here because I have charges.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.650
So investigate me, why are you dragging my brother into this?

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.290
Three-hundred million won (~$300,000) was deposited in your brother's account.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.100
Why do you think such a huge amount was deposited in a jobless person's account?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.540
What are you talking about right now? Huh?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.700
The place that sent the money is

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.580
a company related to TJ, which you're investigating.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.750
A company that has nothing to do with your brother.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.620
You used your brother's account, right?

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.460
It was a ruse to get that money and share it with the members of your team.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.680
Seriously, a ruse?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.380
A ruse?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.300
It's you, isn't it?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.200
You are the one behind all of this, aren't you?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.300
What are you doing?

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.790
I know it's you, Jang Gi Jin!

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.810
Yes.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.390
It's me, you bastard.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.180
I've confirmed it. The money that was deposited.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.820
Why didn't you let us know right away?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.230
Didn't you think it seemed suspicious?

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.300
Your brother is a detective. You should've let us know!

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.950
I just thought it was sent by mistake.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.160
Anyway, you didn't touch the money they sent to your account, right?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.240
Well,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.990
I took it out for a moment and bought some stocks.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.150
You...

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.000
I was going to return the original amount the moment it went up.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.920
I just need to deposit an even amount back.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.260
Luckily, it went up a little.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.180
Is that what you should be saying?

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.380
Why did you take that money when it's not yours? That's a crime!

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.340
You're still not in your right mind.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.070
If things go wrong, Dong Wook might end up in prison because of you!

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.660
Hey, hey, hey!

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.160
He didn't do anything wrong. He was just unluckily caught in a trap.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.140
Anyway, I'm glad the original amount can be secured.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.210
Withdraw it quickly and put the exact amount back into your bank account.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.470
Okay. By the way, is Dong Wook really going to prison

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.570
because of me?

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.550
No, no. That won't happen.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.050
We won't stand back, don't worry about it.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.430
By the way, how do you think they found your account?

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.440
- Did someone ask for it?
- No. No one did.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.980
And recently, I didn't have any reason to receive or give money,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.760
so I didn't really use it much.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.900
Then what was the last transaction you used the account for?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.870
Well, it was this guy who said he was a team leader in TJ.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.440
- Choi Yong Geun?
- Yes.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.710
I originally made that bank account because he told me to.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.830
And I think that was the only time I used it, too.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.530
This is Choi Yong Geun's doing.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.780
Jang Gi Jin just acted as his hands and feet.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.860
We should get Jang Gi Jin too.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.170
Based on the statement Goo Jae Choon gave,

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.310
request an arrest warrant from the prosecutor for abetting the attempted murder of Jeong In Beom.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:09.120
That scummy bastard started this fight first. We just have to win.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.940
Only then can we catch Cheon Na Na.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.910
We recently acquired the clothing that victim Jeong Hui Joo wore when she was murdered.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.320
It was evidence that the murderer, Gi Dong Jae, kept hidden.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.640
Why is that evidence coming forth now?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.560
We believe that the detective in charge was concealing it.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.820
What was their intention?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.790
They were going to use it to prove the innocence of Chairman Cheon Sang Woo, who's waiting for an appeal trial.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.520
You said that another person's blood was found on the clothing.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.710
Whose is it?

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.890
We can't reveal that right now. However,

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.220
we're speculating that there's a big possibility

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.280
that the blood was smeared on by someone to manipulate the evidence,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.620
not during the incident, but afterward.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.510
Is there a basis for that?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.220
We confirmed that a huge amount of money was deposited to a family member

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.210
of the violent crimes team that's in charge of the case.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.800
To get an acquittal at the second trial, it seems that TJ bribed the detective,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.570
who was concealing the evidence.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.560
When you say "violent crimes team that's in charge of the case,"

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.500
do you mean the Incheon West Police Station's violent crimes team?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.470
Yes, that's right.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.060
Incheon West's violent crimes team

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.130
played the biggest role in getting Chairman Cheon Sang Woo convicted as the instigator of a murder.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.440
So why would they now be trying to prove Chairman Cheon Sang Woo's innocence?

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.660
That's a great question.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.720
If he had been acquitted at the first trial, everyone would've been suspicious.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.100
They would've been criticized for releasing the chairman of a chaebol's family.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.080
Get a sentence at the first trial, and get him released during an appeals trial.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.510
That's the scenario created by Chairman Cheon Sang Woo

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.430
and the Incheon West team.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.970
Didn't you say you burned Jeong Hui Joo's clothing?

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.580
Why was it in your hands?

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.390
Why? Why?

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.760
It's the same reason why Gi Dong Jae kept the clothing instead of burning it.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.260
To get rid of the evidence, I did way too many things.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.550
Just as before, the moment you decide to wash your hands of me, saying that you never ordered such things,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.840
I'd fall into hell.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.990
I was just preparing for that kind of situation.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.560
And?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.980
Whose blood was found on the clothing?

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.930
You know that better than anyone else.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.340
As you spoke in front of the reporters, can you even twist the blood into something that was manipulated?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.840
I can't do it by myself. I need your help.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:47.190
Police, prosecution, and even the media. You need to help from behind the scenes.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.520
Me?

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.720
If things go wrong just one more time, you and me,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.980
it would be the end for both of us.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:02.300
Do you think you can tie me down with just some blood?

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.360
You can't do that. Neither can the detectives.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.390
I decide my own ending.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.390
There's no one but me who can ruin my life now.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.890
I decide everything.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:21.490
You'll have to tie the bow neatly, not for me, but for yourself.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.260
Goo Jae Choon and Jang Gi Jin talked on a burner phone.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.120
That means that the two of them planned Jeong In Beom's murder beforehand.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.130
Also,

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:35.620
the evidence that Jang Gi Jin handed Gi Dong Jae over to Goo Jae Choon is clear.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.150
Excuse me?

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.570
I understand.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.670
I'll report again after further investigation.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.220
Yes.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.990
- What did they say?
- They said it's insufficient to prove that the two conspired together.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.840
Do you think Jang Gi Jin announcing that we manipulated the evidence

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.130
- affected things?
- That's probably it.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.900
The prosecutor can't trust us, either.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.010
Honestly, from other people's view, don't you think the Seoul MIU's announcement

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.780
would have more sway than us, the West Incheon police force?

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.760
We were pushed back by Jang Gi Jin.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.910
Cheon Na Na probably helped from behind.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.730
TJ's power has shifted towards Cheon Na Na, and that power was probably applied.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.410
Really.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.720
The director of the audit and inspection division from the main agency called,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.180
and they said all of you are to be summoned for an investigation.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.900
Each of the team members?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.770
Yes. Their reasons for summoning are serious.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.930
I think Jang Gi Jin really got us good this time.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.880
I mean, everything is just a fabrication by them!

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.260
There's no reason to be scared.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.100
We just need to go and tell the truth.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.500
Rather than arresting us,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.300
his intention to take us away from our investigation is more concerning.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.700
Not everyone has to go for now.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.580
I'll go first and try to adjust the situation.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.950
Why is the size of your opponent getting bigger each time?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.140
You overdid it.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.600
You were overly greedy. You went too far this time.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.960
Do you think I did it on purpose?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.290
I was just investigating a murder case, but then bigger bodies got dragged along with it.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.470
Then you should've avoided it.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.550
You're not the only one getting their head smashed in.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.970
All your team members are about to get fired.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.210
What are you going to do?

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:26.310
Don't try to scare me, you guys must already understand. You know that I'm not that kind of guy.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.510
If you look a little bit deeper, you can tell which side is playing tricks.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.910
I don't care about such things.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.710
There's only one thing I know.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:38.230
If I held out a helping hand to you now, a boulder the size of a house would land in my future.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:44.030
I'm not asking you to help, I'm just asking to give us a bit of time.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:48.570
All they want is for us to run out of time. Just a bit of time.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.620
Please, Senior Inspector Yoon Sang Mi, please...

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.860
Seonbae, once was enough.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:07.220
You were cop-like, and honestly, you were really cool.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.590
Now stop here instead of showing off further.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.960
Damn woman, nothing has changed.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.230
It went wrong, didn't it?

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.910
Do you, by any chance, know anyone at the main agency?

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.250
There are tons of police academy alumni.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.600
Yeah, there are a lot.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.600
But most of them

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.320
are people who hate me, so...

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.500
Why did you live like that?

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.520
I lived like you.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.090
And I'm going to keep living like you, too.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.570
What?

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.300
Why do you live like that?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.470
What? Whatever. If you're going to nag, hang up.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.860
I'm asking why you live so carelessly.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.710
If you're going to ask for favors, you should've called me somewhere more secretive to talk.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.580
Why would you ask when there are people around?

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.740
That's why you can't get beyond a senior policeman rank.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.750
Hey! How great did you live your life that you can throw a fit like this?

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:25.130
Aigoo. Saying 'throwing a fit' to a much higher-ranking person?

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.060
Have some awareness of who's higher and lower in your life.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.600
Hang up! Hang up, I said!

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:35.500
I looked into it again, and about a week... I think I need that time to review.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.180
What?

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.990
Excuse me?

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.640
Oh, yes.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.620
Yes, Senior Inspector Yoon Sang Mi, as I thought,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.940
you're very thorough. Of course. You should review it thoroughly.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.600
One week.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.430
I'll follow the principle after that.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.070
Yes, ma'am. Salute!

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.640
As I thought, I lived well. You just need to live like I do.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.120
No more, no less, just like Kang Do Chang.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.690
Yes, sir.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.770
We bought ourselves some time for now. How are we supposed to turn this situation around?

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.170
We should get someone to have our backs, too.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.910
What do you mean?

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:24.210
Someone who is much stronger than Cheon Na Na.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.950
You feel like your head's about to explode, right? Because you're making up a lot of stories.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:35.720
Hey, even so, shouldn't there be some probability?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.070
Don't you think this doesn't make sense at all?

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.290
Didn't you order them to manipulate it?

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:47.180
I'm not good at making up fake things like you.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.670
So it was Dad.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.900
Sure. Now everything fits together.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.130
Did you really believe that way?

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.380
You're a son he loves.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.480
What won't he do for his son?

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.210
He's someone who thinks I put you in this situation.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.400
He's someone who would do anything to kill me and save you.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.170
But then, why does the situation only end in your favor?

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.030
Huh? Do you think Dad is so stupid?

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.720
Dad is confused.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.910
Dad thinks he still has power.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.660
He doesn't know all that power has shifted to me.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.620
That's why he's acting thoughtlessly.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.230
You're the only one who thinks that!

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.470
We never gave you power! You're the only one who thinks you have it!

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.320
I'm telling you that everything is just happening in your head!

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.070
Do you know why I want to go where Dad used to be?

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:59.000
Dad makes everything he thinks into reality.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.120
If Dad wants it, it becomes real. It doesn't matter if it makes sense or not.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.930
If Dad says it's the truth, it becomes the truth.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:12.270
I'll show you the world where my thoughts become reality.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.850
You can't. I told you that you can't.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.740
Look at yourself right now. My thought became reality.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.350
Originally, my next thought

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.300
was to get you out of here after some time passed

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.030
if you stayed still.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:49.060
But you and Dad keep making me change my thoughts.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.750
My... I really can't deal with you.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.450
I guess there's no way to deal with such a crazy bitch.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.010
Sure. Keep crushing things to your liking.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.790
I'll keep an eye on

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.570
how far your thoughts can become reality.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:34.420
Well, a subpoena was issued for you from the Incheon West Police Station.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.270
Me? Are you sure? I'm the one being summoned?

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.610
Yes.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.610
What are you doing? Are you purposefully trying to make me angry?

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:49.530
I'm sorry, but they sent an attachment with the subpoena.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.920
That's something that complicates the situation.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:01.780
Because I sent your son, who you think of as your only family, to prison.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.260
It was me who sent the evidence to the police as well.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.340
Even if I'm your daughter, do you think you can forgive me?

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.740
You came here determined today, didn't you?

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.690
To poke at me so that I won't be able to leave you alone.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.920
[A warm and trustworthy police force for the people]

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.570
Did Na Na send that recording?

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.390
Yes.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.350
What are you planning to use that for?

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:30.200
You've probably seen it in the media, but we are in charge of Ms. Cheon Na Na's case.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.450
It's evidence that was submitted by the victim, so we can't ignore it.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.630
It's a father nagging his daughter.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:42.620
If a father, whoever that may be, heard such a thing, they'd lose their reason, don't you think?

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.440
Yes, that's right.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.760
It's something you could say. However,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.760
please understand our point of view.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.870
Ms. Cheon Na Na collapsing from an overdose,

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.890
and what you said to Ms. Cheon Na Na,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.200
coincidentally, fit too well.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.430
And? Do I have to explain myself to you people?

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.080
You don't need to,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.830
because we are also confident that this is a self-fabricated scenario by Ms. Cheon Na Na.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.790
Then, are you saying

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.550
I should say that my daughter fabricated this scenario

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.680
so that she could blame the crime on me?

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.000
We're asking for you to help us with the investigation.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.110
To tell you the truth, the investigation we're doing

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.260
is being hindered. Block that hindrance for us, please.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.430
If I don't cooperate,

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.140
you will release this to the media. Is that what you're saying?

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.590
Yes.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.600
Right now, my pride is greatly hurt.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.950
I did lose power, but

00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:00.780
I didn't get weak enough to make a deal with you people.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.390
Release that recording to the media.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.030
It's clearly what I said, so I should take responsibility for it.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.950
Your names are

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.760
Detective Kang Do Chang, Oh Ji Hyeok, right?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.610
Yes.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:24.700
The people I remember the names of are either

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.150
people who did me a big favor,

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:32.130
or someone who made me feel unforgettable shame.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.930
It's one or the other.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.110
I don't think I will forget your names,

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.120
no matter what meaning I remember you for.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.110
[A warm and trustworthy police force for the people]

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.470
- Chairman!
- Block him.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.310
Chairman, there's something I need to tell you.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.050
Open the door for him.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.840
The investigation we're doing

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.740
is an investigation to prove that Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:25.370
If that's proven, Chairman Cheon Sang Woo would be acquitted and released.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.500
The situation I expected is finally right in front of us.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.650
Did the results of the investigation come out?

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:47.970
Yes. I found out the recent transaction price of a building in Gangnam of a similar size near the location,

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:52.500
and it's about 45 billion won (~$35 million) at the current market price.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.930
If we divide that by eight... eight by five, forty-five...

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:02.310
Hey, you crazy guys. Is this something to be happy about?

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.690
I mean, don't you think it's a bit unfair?

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.270
Right? Shouldn't it be paid differently depending on rank?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.470
Team Leader and Chief, you two should get less, if anything.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.460
Why?

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.660
You don't have much time left. We, who have a longer time to work as detectives, should get more.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.620
That's right.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.110
You guys don't have family.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.620
The Chief and I, we have more than one or two family members to feed.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.880
I need it too.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:35.960
Chairman Cheon Seong Dae agreed to cooperate. The investigation won't get interrupted anymore.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.870
We can just keep going forward.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.630
Yes, Representative Cha, is it too late?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.710
No. Go ahead.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.830
Would you like to have dinner?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.570
Y-Yes. What is this about, by the way?

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:10.440
I have some people I would like to introduce to you.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.870
- Let's go in.
- Yes, sir.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.080
Hurry and go.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.230
- It's nice to see you.
- Yeah.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.500
- Thank you for calling.
- Yes, thank you.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.520
- Thank you for coming so far.
- My pleasure.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.120
- Hello.
- Aigoo.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.050
- Hello, Chairman.
- Welcome.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.680
It's great seeing you.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.760
- Hello, welcome.
- Aigoo, hello.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.700
Thank you for all your work. Yes, thank you.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.380
Thank you.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:44.190
Dear public officials, president, commissioner, minister,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.390
thank you for accepting my invite.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.490
I'm suddenly realizing that I, Cheon Seong Dae, am still relevant.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.930
Every one of you has a good relationship with me, one way or another.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:04.560
But I have not once asked for your help.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.560
However, there was only a single time I regretted that.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.930
I thought I wasn't picky about food.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.350
But then,

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:18.690
the bean rice I had in jail really didn't agree with me.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.140
I'm a bit shy to say this with my own mouth,

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:29.400
but just because I supported you a little in the past,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.270
I didn't want to burden you.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:36.110
Actually, to be honest,

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:41.390
I left the favor for that one day

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.950
when I would really desperately need your help.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.590
That's this one.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.480
Please help.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.560
- Thank you for coming.
- It was good seeing you.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.290
Goodbye.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.700
I had a great time.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.870
Thank you for the meal.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.120
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good night.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.430
I think this was a great opportunity for me as well.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:25.690
Meeting such great people in person was a great honor for me.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.040
You grew up in the US, yes?

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.870
Yes, that's right.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.000
To do business in Korea, remember this.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.290
We don't do business with money here like in the US.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.930
We do it with politics.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.500
Yes.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.660
What are you people doing here? Huh?

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.250
This is a search and seizure warrant.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.120
What's the reason?

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.310
- Did you draw this yourself?
- Yes.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.990
You said you saw him for a second in a glance.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.080
Can you draw in detail like this with just that?

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.950
Did someone give you a picture, and you drew from that by any chance?

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.950
Prosecutor, can I have a piece of paper?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.330
Yes, Inspector, could you come in for a second?

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.520
Yes, Prosecutor, what can I do for you?

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.530
Never mind. You can go.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.150
Okay.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.350
Tell me what happened between you and Team Leader Jang Gi Jin

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:13.270
on that day at Mr. Jeong In Beom's shoe store without leaving anything out.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.950
[Police]

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.670
Team Leader, what happened?

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.850
- What?
- The charge written on the warrant for you was the murder of Gi Dong Jae,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.650
- and conspiring in the attempted murder of Jeong In Boem.
- Hey,

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.160
do you believe that?

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.570
It's some bullshit that they're doing after believing whatever Goo Jae Choon spewed out.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:45.900
Team Leader, I mean, Hyeongnim, the things you're doing recently,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.250
are a bit unreasonable, even from our standpoint.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.030
Explain it to us, please.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:53.920
Why you're piecing the case together in a strange way?

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.850
Goo Jae Choon. Summon him from jail.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:04.780
I'll interrogate him myself to reveal what the real truth is.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.730
This is easier to eat than just a block of tofu.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.200
Good job enduring. Eat.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.000
What about my brother?

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.420
He messed up again, didn't he?

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.780
Hey. He did a commendable thing.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.630
Thanks to his cooperating fully, we didn't have to trace the account separately.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.720
I heard he took out and used the money.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.060
That's, you see, he had an intuition that it was bad money.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:35.490
So, in case it caused you harm, he laundered it. Money laundering.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.650
Hyeongnim, do you think that makes sense?

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.710
What? It doesn't?

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:45.400
Come on, money laundering? Why are you using a criminal term here?

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.130
Hey, don't blame your brother. He was just used by bad guys. He did nothing wrong.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.640
Yeah.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.770
He kept worrying about you the whole time.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:59.140
And you were released because he didn't get greedy about the money and told us everything.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.990
Okay.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.560
I'm sorry.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:08.070
- Hey, Man Goo, if you open my cabinet, there's a soju I've hidden away.
- Here.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.990
Did you open it? Without my consent?

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:18.110
Until I put handcuffs on Jang Gi Jin's wrists, I won't have a drop of alcohol.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.620
I will arrest him and send him away with my own hands.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.580
Okay.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.630
Then, shall we?

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.950
Yes, Senior Inspector Yoon Sang Mi?

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.030
You've grown a lot. You even used some higher-up's power.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.020
What are you talking about?

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.490
Today the commissioner called me himself

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:47.640
to tell me to stop all audits on the Incheon West Station detectives.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:53.580
I see. Well, the commissioner of the Incheon region is just controllable by a single phone call from me.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.890
Not the Incheon region commissioner but the Seoul main agency.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.530
The commissioner general called himself.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.280
That was the first time I was on the phone with him, too.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.290
What? He himself?

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:09.200
What kind of amazing line do you have to be in for the commissioner general to step in?

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.810
Well, I can't tell you that.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:16.070
In the police organization, there's a secret line that is hidden.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.850
Just know that I'm in the center of that line.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.840
I see, is that so?

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:28.340
But I think I have to hang up. I think I'll end up swearing at you soon.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:33.950
And don't you ever answer my phone call when your mind

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:36.800
is not sound after a day drinking.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.940
Did something good happen today?

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:46.260
Just... I'm crazy.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.860
I'm about to go crazy.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:48:00.310
I intend to pay my dues. So you pay yours too. Let's do this according to principle.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.030
Stop trying to play tricks.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.290
If we do this according to principle, you will be sentenced to life in jail.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.660
I mean, what are you trying to lure me into now?

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.700
I saw all the bullshit you do.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.870
I'm still a police officer.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.670
I can at least cover you.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.560
Stop bullshitting me,

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.480
and go to a Buddhist temple or a church and pray.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.760
Pray that you won't be sent to the same prison as me, you bastard.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:31.320
You bastard, bastard, you bastard.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.270
Yeah.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.100
It's me.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.690
I'll put your big boss on the line. Talk to him.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:42.930
Answer it.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.290
Answer.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.770
It's your most trustworthy henchman.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.570
Yeah, what is it?

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.500
Are you sure?

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.020
Cash?

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.000
Is that so?

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.470
I got it for now.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.570
I said I got it, you idiot.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.640
You'll take care of my family, but that's too bad.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.310
I don't have family to take care of.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:21.280
Even if I do, they're just a headache to me.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.350
I have no intention of taking care of my family at all.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:33.170
Even if I use all the money in prison after getting sentenced to life, it's still too much money.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.130
I don't think I can use it before I'm dead.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.370
You did a useless thing.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:48.920
Must we die together? Let's live. Together.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.450
Okay?

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.560
Good job. Over here.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.940
Hyeongnim!

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.620
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.200
This will take a bit of time.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.350
You two need to go get some food, right?

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.210
No, it's alright.

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:32.430
How's the warden?

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.810
Is he pouting about something I did? He won't answer my phone calls.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:40.880
Please put in a good word for me. Tell him I'll visit soon.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.160
Okay.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.880
Does the warden still go to karaoke after drinking?

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.950
Today the murder suspect Goo Jae Choon
[Gangnam East Gang leader Goo Jae Choon escaped "during an investigation"]

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.460
leisurely escaped in a police officer outfit
[Leisurely escaped during murder suspect investigation]

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.930
in the middle of being investigated by the Seoul MIU.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.450
The police are intensifying inspections and searches throughout the city,

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:01.190
and are chasing the fugitive Goo Jae Choon.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:05.790
However, there are no clues to his whereabouts.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.570
Wow, what kind of freaking situation is this now?

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.840
Jang Gi Jin, that jerk, made this happen.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.170
He's saying let's see how far we can go.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.580
Jang Gi Jin helped him escape. He probably has him hidden somewhere.

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.520
He'll kill him after hiding him for a bit.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.250
Because Goo Jae Choon has to die for his charges to disappear.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.580
Goo Jae Choon will come out if we keep chasing Jang Gi Jin.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.660
Hey, do you think that sly bastard will let us catch him?

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.920
That's true. He's probably prepared thoroughly, knowing that we're after him.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.300
I'm back.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.990
Hey, where were you? You didn't even answer your phone. I was worried about you.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.080
Jang Gi Jin is in the palm of my hand.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:50.250
I followed him secretly and got all of his regular foot traffic in my head.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.390
You're done with this?

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:55.510
- Yeah. Why? What do you need it for?
- I think I'll have use for it.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.790
Don't make a move prematurely.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:01.150
If you're clumsily trailing or installing a tracker or something, you'll be discovered right away.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.330
- Then that will all be for nothing.
- Yes, I know.

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:07.180
The only way is to physically do things in this kind of case, like you said.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.740
It's about time he comes out of a meeting. I'm going to head out.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.940
Just trust me, and wait for me. I'll contact you the moment he shows any signs.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.320
Hey, Dong Wook!

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.610
What's he so confident about?

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:23.780
Trust him. He says he'll physically deal with it. Detectives talk with their bodies.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:55.660
I put one in because I thought you might find yourself in a bad situation.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.920
It's loaded, so check it out.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.760
Goodbye.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:20.980
Hey, everyone still has bullets left, right?

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.330
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.790
Put your gun down.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.710
Hey, you too.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.210
Yes, sir!

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.140
Arrest him.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:48.090
You should be glad about your luck. I almost blew your head off. I held back with all my might.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.970
Hey,

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:05.970
let him out, quickly.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.290
Hey, you.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.590
Hold on.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.350
♫ Baby (baby) ♫

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.360
How long were you in there?

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.330
This... throw this away for me.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.640
♫ I'm telling you, baby ♫

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.000
You should've just peed your pants, you clean-freak.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.470
- I caught you.
- Good job.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:35.040
I caught him.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.640
♫ When you're here with me, baby, sunshine ♫

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.440
- Ji Woong,
- Yes?

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.150
Take the handcuffs off Team Leader Jang Gi Jin.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.220
Excuse me?

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:55.870
We need to hear him out. We might have misunderstood the situation.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.530
And also, it's not right to put handcuffs on a fellow detective.

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.540
Okay.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.520
Sit down!

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.670
Sit down.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:06.150
Here.

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:17.380
Okay then, Team Leader Jang Gi Jin, you should talk first.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.000
Why were you two there together?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.840
You were trying to capture Goo Jae Choon, right?

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.690
He's the one who lost him, so he was trying to catch him himself. Right?

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:32.750
Then how can you explain the money bag, and the fake passport, gun, that was seized on site?

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:34.470
That was entrapment.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:38.130
Using that as bait to lure Goo Jae Choon, he was trying to capture him. Right?

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.850
Now that I hear it, it makes sense.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:42.120
Is that what this man said?

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.760
You saw it. You saw him trying to shoot me.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.160
He was trying to get rid of the evidence by killing me.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.380
Come on, no way.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.660
I was just a marionette.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.400
I had no intention of running away at all.

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.970
This guy told my henchman and brought me the police uniform,

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:03.530
and it was this guy who got the boat for me and a bag of money.

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:08.220
Hey! Stop talking nonsense! He's the team leader of the Seoul MIU!

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.480
Why would such a person do such a bad thing? Why? For what?

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.260
That Seoul MIU team leader...

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:17.090
that grandpa... Jeong Hui Joo's grandpa!

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:22.720
This guy ordered us to, so we tried to kill him. And to cover that up, he made me escape

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.380
and tried to get rid of me!

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.170
And the murder of Gi Dong Jae. It was also this guy who gave him to us

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.370
telling us to kill that bastard!

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.740
Watch what will happen if you take his side just because he's a fellow policeman.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:38.480
I really won't stand back. I'll open it all up to every reporter I know!

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.310
That the detectives conspired and are blaming it all on me!

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.100
- Ji Woong,
- Yes?

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.560
- Team Leader Jang Gi Jin,
- Yes.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:52.110
- put his handcuffs back on.
- Yes, sir.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:57.310
These people think I'm some stupid person.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.730
Don't be rough.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:01.060
- Two clicks.
- Okay.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.310
Do you think I'm stupid? Okay, okay.

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:11.420
This wasn't something that happened because Jang Gi Jin messed up.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.240
Former chairman Cheon Seong Dae is watching the detectives' back.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.630
If things keep going this way, eventually,

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:25.410
Chairman Cheon Sang Woo can be acquitted and released. If that happens,

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:31.310
we will be giving the detectives room to re-investigate the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.480
And then?

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.510
Well, even if they re-investigate,

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:38.630
there shouldn't be any more new evidence to come out of it.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.180
The one thing that bothers me

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.310
is the Woo Tae Ho case.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.540
If it's revealed that case was intentional and not an accident,

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:56.420
it establishes the causality with the Jeong Hui Joo murder case.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:02.600
It becomes a reason for the detectives to keep holding onto the Jeong Hui Joo case.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:07.090
You don't have to worry about it.

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:12.210
The detectives will think I was trying to die with him.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.010
That's the truth as well.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.240
Is that true?

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.900
Yes.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.460
[Four months ago]

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:33.600
That the person who killed Jeong Hui Joo

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.950
wasn't me.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.210
Then who?

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:41.030
I don't know, either.

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:46.130
Why should I believe you?

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:47.830
Do you, by any chance,

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:53.030
know that there's a cabin somewhere in Yangpyong?

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.210
I was handed

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.260
Jeong Hui Joo's corpse there.

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.300
By whom?

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.310
Team Leader Choi Yong Geun.

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.330
He killed Jeong Hui Joo?

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.770
I don't know that.

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.420
However,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.420
there's no reason for him to kill Jeong Hui Joo with his own hands.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.680
Because if he just waited,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.700
I would've killed Jeong Hui Joo on my own.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:32.050
"Then, did the vice chairman Cheon Sang Woo kill her himself?"

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.660
I thought about that.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.790
But then Team Leader Choi told me

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.760
to tell vice chairman Cheon Sang Woo that I killed her.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.840
"You can only get the money if you say that."

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.440
After I was given the corpse, I called vice chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.160
At the time,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.070
I tried telling him that I couldn't kill Jeong Hui Joo yet.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.770
Then he told me to hurry up and kill her.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.760
It means vice chairman Cheon

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.120
didn't know that Jeong Hui Joo was dead.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.970
"Then it wasn't Cheon Sang Woo."

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.030
"Then who can it be?"

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:18.250
"The shadow that I saw

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.000
at the cabin when I was handed the corpse..."

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.840
"Who can that be?"

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.770
I told you all the facts that I know.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.130
It's your turn now.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.430
In your head,

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.970
there's a person that came up, right

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:46.640
Who is it?

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.770
That person.

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.110
[Gyeonggi-do Yangpyong-gun Seongsa-myeon Ocheon-ri 101]

What is it?

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.360
That day...

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.420
Why were you here?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.420
On the day Jeong Hui Joo was murdered,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.090
why did you come here?

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.870
I don't remember.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.670
When are you talking about exactly?

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.190
I saw the driving record on your car.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.690
You were here that day.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.090
I must've been here then.

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.890
With who?

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:09.360
Jeong Hui Joo?

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.160
Why did you bring her here?

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:23.610
I asked her

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.880
why she

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.140
loved

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.620
you.

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:37.740
Did you love her too?

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.810
I'm still confused.

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.860
Tae Ho,

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.140
do you think we did something like love?

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.780
Was it painful

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.270
when she died?

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:20.260
How do you feel today?

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:24.400
You came knowing it.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.550
How do you feel?

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.670
Is it as painful as that day?

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:36.260
I didn't love you.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.940
If I loved you,

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.060
I would've killed Jeong Hui Joo.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.470
But I didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.510
What you're thinking is wrong.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:57.850
Cheon Sang Woo... my brother Cheon Sang Woo

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.590
killed Jeong Hui Joo.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.520
No.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.850
Cheon Sang Woo didn't kill her.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.580
I killed her.

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:17.370
To prevent Hui Joo and my relationship from being revealed,

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.340
I killed Jeong Hui Joo.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:25.680
Everything started because of me. That's the right thing.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.150
Na Na, you

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.000
didn't do anything.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.830
I'll confess.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.900
Even the police

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.520
will understand my motive for the murder.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.420
Who is this for?

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.030
Jeong Hui Joo?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.480
Or me?

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:53.580
I...

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.060
killed Jeong Hui Joo here.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.750
It's an accidental murder.

About ten years...

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.380
About ten years later,

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:19.490
I'll be able to see you again.

Na Na, you

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.700
just need to say one thing to me then.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.180
That you

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:38.860
forgive me.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.980
What should I do?

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.410
I still don't

have any intention to forgive you.

Let Cheon Na Na do her own thing for a little while.

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.050
You've already chosen one of the two.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:09.820
I looked into my brother's trial a bit.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.420
I saw Detective Oh's name as a defense witness.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.600
You are the culprit.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.900
Won't you regret it?

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.410
I'll definitely prove that my thoughts are correct, even if I have to do it alone.

01:08:17.410 --> 01:08:19.480
I said I didn't kill her!

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.840
The real culprit's scenario is perfectly planned.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.560
But there's one plot hole.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.500
Are you talking about Choi Yong Geun?

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.210
Do you have any fellow detectives that died?

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:29.310
They're probably already trying to find me by now.

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:33.500
We now have a relationship where we must trust each other.
