00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.620
[Final Episode]

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.220
You're currently residing at Riwoong Apartment in Hannam-dong. Is that correct?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.240
The ownership recently passed into your name.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.440
This is an apartment built by a TJ-affiliated construction company.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.800
And just recently, your wife bought a three-story building.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.200
Isn't your wife a housewife?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.370
Where did she suddenly get such a large amount of money?

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.840
Who gave it to you?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.960
Choi Yong Geun?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.010
Cheon Na Na?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.160
- Excuse me?
- Hey, Detective Jang, as an older detective,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.300
I'll ask you frankly.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.720
Why on earth did you do it?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.020
We have to confirm the report we wrote anyway,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.840
so just say it's incorrect if it is.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.150
Job,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.760
team leader at the Seoul MIU. That's correct, right?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
You worked at the East Busan Police Station as a violent crimes detective for fifteen years.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.060
And after arresting the culprit in the Busan Ocheon-dong serial murder case,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.420
as well as catching the Haeundae family murderer,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.070
you were promoted to senior inspector at the Seoul MIU,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.220
and you transferred there three years ago, correct?

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.990
Until recently, you made a dedicated team of detectives

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.630
to capture Lee Seong Gon, and worked without a break for three months.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020
You wanted to capture him.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.600
You held onto it like crazy because you really wanted to capture him,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.300
but eventually you couldn't, and it was stolen by random people.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.460
And because of that case, you became involved in the Jeong Hui Joo case, right?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.970
I'm asking if I'm correct.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.460
You tried to capture a guy who killed a person.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.740
You overworked yourself to capture Lee Seong Gon.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.900
To relieve those who died unjustly,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.850
you grabbed onto the case alongside your team members without sleeping.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.480
Is that all correct, you asshole?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.240
I'm asking if that's correct, you bastard.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.710
Let's stop because everything's correct.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.430
Order him some food.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430
Okay.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.740
What would you like?

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.660
The soybean soup combo is good here.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.820
I'd recommend that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.080

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160
I don't have any appetite.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.120
After you left, Jang Gi Jin asked for a favor.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690
He said he'd admit to all the charges,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.990
so in the motive of the criminal section,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.300
he just wanted us to write "money," and nothing else.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.060
Right, money.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.960
Because of money.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.850
Let's say that's what it was.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.960
He said

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.750
he'll tell us one last thing as a policeman.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.530
Do you know

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.070
what the most painful memory is from my career as a detective?

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.710
I knew who the real culprit was.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.620
I knew for certain who it was, but I was not able to capture him.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.100
I felt like I was going to go crazy.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.680
I was so angry

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.580
that I even thought of biting my tongue off and dying.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.070
I now pass the pain I felt as a detective,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.900
over to you people.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.200
Jeong Hui Joo

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.910
was killed by Cheon Na Na.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.380
He's thinking we won't be able to arrest Cheon Na Na.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.520
That's not totally wrong.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.090
The only evidence is

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.870
Cheon Na Na's blood on Jeong Hui Joo's clothing.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.080
Motive for murder, evidence from the crime scene.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.850
We haven't found anything.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.990
Even if she had a lawyer who had just graduated defending her,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.810
they could easily prove not guilty in this situation.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040
I don't care about any of that.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.950
Cheon Na Na killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.070
That's the only thing that needs to be ingrained in my head.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.980
Even if I die from biting my tongue as Jang Gi Jin said,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.370
I'll never forget that.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.830
I'm sorry,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.500
you should let it all go now and live a good life.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.970
What about my father?

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.380
Are you going to apologize to my father?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.230
Your father

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.660
was a good man.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.710
I was in the wrong back then.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.030
This is fun.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.350
Are you back from your workout?

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.020
Soo Yeon.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.430
- Yes?
- This is Grandfather.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.060
Let's say hello to Grandfather.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.800
Who is this?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.370
Your granddaughter.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.660
She's your biological granddaughter.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.340
She's my brother's child, born out of wedlock.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.170
Like me.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.550
That's why I feel more affection for her.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.130
The child's mom is someone he met at a bar some time ago.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.310
The assault case that happened two years ago was also because of this child's mother─

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.900
That's enough. I don't need any other explanations.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.830
Just tell me why you brought that child to my house.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.380
Of course, she should come to our house.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.990
She's my biological niece.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.180
With whose permission?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.000
I expected you to be against it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.840
It will be a big blow to the image of my imprisoned brother,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.340
and if the mother's assault case gets revealed to the world,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.850
people probably won't even treat my brother as a human being.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.450
That's a bit worrisome.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.080
The representative of McQueen contacted me

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.800
saying that they'd recommend you as the CEO instead of Sang Woo.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.540
But that's only possible if you take my side.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.050
If you're really against it, I'll reconsider Soo Yeon's situation.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.940
If I let this get publicized, there may be no place for my brother,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.430
even if he comes back.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.470
Send the child back.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.790
Did you want to see me, Chief?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.330
Bong Sik.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.880
I love you, Bong Sik!

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.870
♫ Baby (baby). You give me real good feelings (that's alright) ♫

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.360
♫ I'm telling you, baby (baby) ♫

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.150
Everyone, gather.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.360
Our...

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.660
chief...

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.100
at this upcoming annual personnel appointment,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.200
is up for promotion to superintendent general!

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.560
♫ When you're here with me there'll be good times, good times, yeah ♫

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.850
Let me introduce the person

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.300
who will replace me and lead TJ from this seat.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.370
Come in.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.010
Sit, please.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.520
I'm Cheon Na Na.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.250
From now on, TJ Group

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.730
is no longer a group that exists for a single person or group.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.330
We will become a community

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.020
where everyone becomes a leader, and everyone is responsible.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.720
I will stand back, so go forth.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.530
From now on, go one step at a time towards the top.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.400
I will be applauding you from the sidelines.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.340
The future of TJ is not decided only by me,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.700
but by all of you.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.550
I did everything I could.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.170
Now it's your turn to keep your promise.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.430
We'll prepare the best we can until the trial.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.130
Your best isn't enough.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.980
Don't you think you should give me confidence?

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.110
The fact that Gi Dong Jae didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo is certain. That's provable.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.570
Who's the real culprit?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:21.170
If the real culprit is found, wouldn't that make my son's innocence even clearer?

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.700
I think that's going to be a bit difficult to do in this trial.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.890
Is Na Na the real culprit?

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.040
That's a big possibility.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.750
Both of them

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.010
are my children.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.790
Can't you help both of them?

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.360
If you didn't have our back this time around,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.660
the investigation of your daughter Cheon Na Na would've been impossible.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.750
You've already chosen one of the two.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.480
There was a subpoena from the prosecutor not so long ago.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.480
It seems like, at the next trial,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.350
they're going to release me on probation.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.050
That's good.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.130
Releasing me means

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.610
that Chairman Cheon Sang Woo will be released as well.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.670
Would that be possible?

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.680
The former chairman is making his move.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.270
If he's involved with the detectives,

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.180
it's definitely possible.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.810
Don't you think that's not okay?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.510
There's clear evidence that he commissioned a murder.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.980
It's simpler than you think.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.460
If the detectives present evidence

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.800
that Gi Dong Jae didn't actually commit the crime,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.240
even if the real culprit is not identified,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.810
Chairman Cheon Sang Woo will be acquitted.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.380
From what I can tell,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.720
the detectives have enough evidence to prove that.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.820
You'll need to be prepared.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.500
Nothing changes just because my brother is released.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.520
Things have changed a lot from before.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.860
The problem is the detectives.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.060
The thing that concerns me the most,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.990
is not my father, my brother, nor the detectives.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.240
It's you.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.050
Who do you think killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.200
"The person who killed Jeong Hui Joo is Cheon Sang Woo."

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.610
That's all you need to believe in.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.170
You do think that way, right?

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.590
Of course.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.820
It's good.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.420
Yeah, eat as much as you want.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.570
I should've fed you more often.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.930
Today it's chicken, but once my superintendent general promotion is confirmed,

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.280
then instead of chicken, "moo"...

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.240
It will be cow!

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.430
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.080
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.980
I think this is even better than beef.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.030
Hyeong, you haven't given up on the lottery, have you?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.360
I did, but then,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.250
last night I had a dream, and Detective Oh suddenly appeared,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.340
and gave me six numbers out of thin air.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.770
That makes sense.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.140
He gave you these numbers instead of the Gangnam building.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.490
I can remember five of them,

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.970
but I can't remember the last one.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.510
How about eighteen?

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.590
Eighteen?
(T/N: Eighteen is pronounced like Korean f-word)

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.190
You said Detective Oh gave you the numbers.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.270
If the chief gets promoted,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.800
becoming a Gangnam building owner won't happen.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.710
That number just popped into my head.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.170
Eighteen.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.710
Oh, that's good.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.940
Here, here, here!

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.620
You can both sit here if we just squeeze in!

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.420
Owning just one restaurant doesn't seem like enough!

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.830
This isn't my restaurant. Don't worry. There will be a seat soon.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.060
You're showing off. I'm jealous.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.490
Oppa! Answer the delivery order.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.240
Yes, this is a chicken restaurant.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.240
Yes? Yes, we can deliver.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.970
Where? Seoul?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.160
That's a bit...

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.780
We're in Incheon.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.250
Excuse me?

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.620
One moment, please.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.530
They said they're the headquarters of TJ.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.100
They ordered chicken. What does this mean?

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.980
They're telling us to deliver it.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.770
Cheon Na Na,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.190
what on earth is on her mind?

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.740
Everything that's happening around you from now on,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.470
is because of you.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.910
It's a warning from Cheon Na Na.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.880
If we keep poking at her, she's saying she might do something to your family.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.370
It's good.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.440
Did you order all the way from Seoul

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.630
because you knew my sister runs a chicken restaurant?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.820
I'll let people know about it.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.740
Business will be even better than now.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.460
It's already doing well.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.600
You don't need to worry about us.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.030
I owe you one too, Detective Kang. I need to pay you back.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.810
What do you mean by you owe me one?

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.830
Is it a good meaning or a bad meaning?

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.780
It's good, but I don't eat much.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.530
I looked into my brother's trial a bit.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.220
I saw Detective Oh's name as a defense witness.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.630
Shouldn't you be a witness for the prosecution?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.960
Gi Dong Jae is not the person who killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.360
[TJ Chairman Cheon Na Na]

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.070
It's Chairman Cheon Na Na.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.570
I should, of course, step in as a witness and explain that.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.460
Hey.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.140
You stand back.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.560
No matter how much you oppose to it, I'll reveal it somehow.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.720
I'm the culprit?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.500
Do you think that, too, Detective Kang?

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.110
I'm the only one who believes that.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.200
You are the culprit.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.700
Hey,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.870
we don't have evidence yet.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:05.400
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you, either. I don't trust you, either.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.880
What?

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.680
Leave it to me.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.410
I'll definitely prove that my thoughts are correct, even if I have to do it alone.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.200
- Won't you regret it?
- Of course.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.820
So you have to release my brother.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.300
I'm just doing things according to the law.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.900
Think things over carefully.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.210
Consider whether releasing my brother is the right thing to do.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.390
If you oppose me, you might be toyed with in a game I made up the rules for.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.110
Don't be mistaken.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.790
It won't be me who would be toyed with. It'd be you.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.370
Before Dong Jae Hyeong died, he said he didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo,

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.900
and that he had evidence, too.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.280
What was the evidence?

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.000
He said that he left it with his older brother.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.910
Dong Jae didn't leave it with me.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.210
He had hidden it.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.910
Did you check it?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:10.040
Yes. It was blood-covered clothing and heels.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.630
Okay, I understand.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.250
Please play the recording.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.640
Gi Dong Jae, who abandoned the body,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.610
recorded the conversation between Choi Yong Geun and himself.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.380
The car that you used to move the body? Drive it a bit, and then drown it.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.150
Even if you take it to a junkyard or burn it, the DNA stays. Put it in water no matter what.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.870
And check if there's any evidence in there before you dump it.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.170
Burn all your belongings until everything becomes ash.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.090
Okay, I will.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.050
Gi Dong Jae got rid of all evidence of abandoning the body, just as Choi Yong Geun instructed.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.720
However, why do you think Gi Dong Jae

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.790
kept the victim Jeong Hui Joo's clothing and heels?

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.170
Gi Dong Jae said that he was hiding something before he died.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.510
He said if I threatened someone with that

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.600
I would be able to get a large sum of money.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.620
Thank you.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.010
After killing Jeong Hui Joo,

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.660
would he have used the victim's clothing and heels for blackmail,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.960
when they would have been critical evidence of his crime?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.690
Don't you think that's a contradiction?

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.670
From the evidence we've collected during the investigation,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.360
there's no direct evidence that proves Gi Dong Jae killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.540
Is he joking?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.020
[Judges]

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.190
I heard that currently, the Incheon West Violent Crimes Team 2

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.220
is continuously investigating the Jeong Hui Joo case. Why is that?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.930
It's because

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.210
we have doubts about the fact that

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.200
Gi Dong Jae murdered Jeong Hui Joo.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.220
Then,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.910
are you admitting to the fact that the investigation at the time

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.200
was flawed?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.460
Yes.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.900
In reality,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.320
it's not easy for the detective in charge to admit

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.710
to negligence in the investigation.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.780
This must have been a great burden, but even then,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.270
what made you want to admit that you were wrong?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.300
At the time, I believed that I didn't do anything wrong.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.420
And now I believe that

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.000
I did do something wrong.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.820
Because now...

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.160
I believe that I did do something wrong.

Please say one word to the citizens.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:11.220
As a socially responsible leader, I'm very sorry for causing controversy.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.640
I will admit my mistakes and reflect upon myself.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.830

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.380
If we held a paternity suit, it would be even more disadvantageous for you.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.030
Please. Let me raise Soo Yeon.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.480
Please.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.540
My brother was released.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.960
Maybe if he was still in jail,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.390
but there's no reason for us to give up Soo Yeon.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.160
What

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.900
do I need to do?

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.710
Thank you.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.760
Sure.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.700
Let's go to mommy's car. You're so pretty.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.610
My baby.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.150
- Thank you.
- Bye.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.830
Let's go.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.800
Soo Yeon,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.210
you only have mom, okay?

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.820
You don't have a grandfather or an aunt.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.910
And you don't have a dad, either.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.680
My Soo Yeon only has Mommy.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.630
Okay?

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.570
- Soo Yeon, you're going to live with only me.
- Yeah.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.260
- You can't go anywhere else, okay?
- Okay.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.540
Congratulations on your success as the new president of TJ.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.900
Thank you.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.190
I'm very impressed the TJ's stock price has risen more than what was forecasted.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.240
Must've been your bold decision to sell off the Japanese distributor.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.380
Buying the Japanese retailer was a mistake

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.510
by ex-chairman Cheon Sang Woo.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.630
It was a company that should have been sold, without a doubt.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.000
[TJ Group's Chairman Cheon Na Na selected as one of the world's top 50 female CEOs by WCN]

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.720
She's doing great,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.670

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.470
Let Cheon Na Na do her own thing for a little while.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.670
Honestly speaking, from the company's standpoint, Na Na's system isn't bad.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.570
Dad, Na Na's blood was found on the clothing of the deceased Jeong Hui Joo.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.390
Na Na's the one who killed her.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.640
She turned me into a person who abetted a murder to hide that.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.240
When I know that so clearly,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.160
how can I just sit still?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.860
So?

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.890
Will you show me how you two bite and scratch each other again?

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.340
Will you only be satisfied if TJ comes to an end with you two?

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:23.020
Why would I end things? I have no intention of doing that.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.970
I'm...

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.030
planning on going to Na Na, bow my head and ask her to look upon me favorably.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.260
"I'll live silently, so just do what you do

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.240
without ever concerning yourself over me."

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.830
Just like that.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.600
Honestly, right now, I'm no competition to Na Na.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.280
I admit that, Father.

- Turn around.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.010

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.670
Chief, be careful.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:35.310
Until yesterday, I was almost one hundred percent certain that I would be promoted to superintendent general.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.690
- Team Leader Woo.
- Yes.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.120
What are the chances I'll get promoted in this shitty situation?

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.430
It doesn't mean that the credit for solving the escape case is gone.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.770
So I'm asking, what percent?

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.960
About twelve to thirteen percent?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.740
Tell me honestly and objectively.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.390
Objectively... about seven.

- I mean 0.7.

Thanks to you guys, I'm back to being an "OG."

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.420
I've decided to just be glad to be an "OGS."

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.670
So you guys should be reckless. Recklessly attack this.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.370
Search the TJ headquarters without a warrant,

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.960
and go round up all the guys you need confessions from and mess them up.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.560
Just beat them up senselessly until they talk.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.980

I understand what you mean.

- No, no.

Anyway, you've done me a favor this time, so I want to repay you.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.540
What should I do for you?

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.030
We don't need it. We just need you to cooperate with us on the assault case.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.140
So what you two really want is to find the real culprit

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.290
who killed Jeong Hui Joo, isn't that right?

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.060
Well, you probably already know.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.580
Blood was found on the victim's clothing,

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.940
but because of the possibility of manipulation, it can't be a solid piece of evidence.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.220
And also about the charges of killing Woo Tae Ho,

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.460
there are fingerprints that were found, but that's not enough to explain things.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.790
Also, there's nothing that clearly points to the motive for murder.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.470
It must be quite a heavy burden in the detectives' point of view.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.100
- You've researched a lot.
- There's nothing to do in jail,

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.400
so I tried putting the cases together from the top.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.440
The real culprit killed Jeong Hui Joo

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.950
and then gave the body to Gi Dong Jae to deal with.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:39.090
Even if the body was found and the investigation proceeded, there was still no need to worry. Why?

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:44.490
Because they had a recording of the moment Cheon Sang Woo arranged the murder.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:49.240
Later on, the blame just needed to be placed onto Cheon Sang Woo.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.130
The real culprit's scenario is perfectly planned.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.830
But

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.190
there's one plot hole.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:01.000
The early parts of the scenario were written by the real culprit.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.250
However, the later parts

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.010
were written by someone else.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.780
It's a joint project.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.800
What if this other person

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.990
is forced to confess in an inescapable situation?

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.890
Are you talking about Choi Yong Geun?

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.080
Are you sure you don't want any?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.550
It's really good.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.560
This time, we'll write the scenario with Cheon Sang Woo,

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.750
because he has the same goal we do.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.270
Are you saying we should work together with that asshole?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.150
You said so yourself. You capture a gangster with another gangster.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.490
And a murderer... you capture with another murderer.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:55.980
It's confirmed that parts of the borrowed account went into Choi Yong Geun's account.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.470
Is that so?

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:04.100
Do you know any prosecutors specializing in finances at the prosecutor's office?

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.380
Yes. I know someone in the Central Seoul district prosecutor's office.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.900
Report to that prosecutor that we have borrowed accounts.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.170
Really.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.700
Yes, this is Choi Yong Geun.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.280
Come see me.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.180
Okay. I will.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.450
You should've been in touch.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.940
You clearly knew that I was released, damn it.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.380
I'm a bit hurt.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.780
I'm sorry.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.010
How are you?

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.630
Right before I got here, something happened.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.250
Why, why, why?

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.420
Did something dangerous happen?

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.110
Don't you know it already?

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.460
I do?

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.530
Why would I?

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:34.080
Are you suspicious of me? That I might have told someone to kill you?

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.830
Well, I suppose that's possible.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:42.510
If you think about what you did to me in court, it's definitely possible.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.140
But don't you think Na Na would be more desperate than I am?

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.480
Since everything will be covered up if only you die.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.440
Now, you make the choice.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.180
Me, or Na Na?

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.360
By whom do you want to be killed?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.780
Chairman, you're pushing it a bit far.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.970
I've already found the money that Na Na deposited to you.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.960
If I send a single file to the prosecution, your money

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.770
will disappear into thin air.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:22.480
Reveal Na Na's hidden truth.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.860
If you do that, not a single coin will leave your account.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:38.380
Na Na... she's a person who killed her own husband.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.370
If the investigation continues, you'll end up like Woo Tae Ho.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.090
Why are you looking around?

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.940
Oh, you're worried that I might be filming or something?

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.030
It's okay, don't worry about it.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.840
I have already removed all the security cameras

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.700
that you installed in my room for Na Na.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.400
But then, why am I speaking so quietly?

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.630
I saw the news, and it said that the TJ Group's borrowed account investigation has begun.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.740
Won't our account be discovered too?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.260
Cheon Na Na is in the chairman's seat.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.360
She'll protect us, one way or another.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.260
I'm also in a president's seat.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.240
Don't worry about it.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.570
Don't trust Cheon Na Na so much.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:47.360
This was Cheon Sang Woo's doing, not Cheon Na Na's.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.580
Cheon Na Na's the only person left to trust at this time, but...

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.400
So,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.200
just wait a bit.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.290
No one can touch that money.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:03.440
Just think of getting out of there soon. I'll have a handsome share ready for you.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.680
Don't worry about me.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.620
There's a separate amount that Cheon Na Na gave me.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.810
I can't get out of here that easily anyway.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.000
I'll put that amount towards my family.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.410
That's enough for me.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.620
Cheon Na Na gave you a separate amount?

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:25.320
She probably wanted to say that the person I need to follow is her, not you.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.330
She could abandon you some day.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.220
She wanted to suggest that as well.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:38.420
The incident with Jeong Hui Joo's grandfather was basically Cheon Na Na's order.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.290
You should be careful, too.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.270
Why should I?

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.760
Think carefully. There are four people who know the truth about this case.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.570
Gi Dong Jae, Woo Tae Ho, Cheon Na Na,

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.760
and...

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.740
you.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.470
Gi Dong Jae and Woo Tae Ho are dead.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.600
You're the only one left

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.940
other than Cheon Na Na.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.220
Hello, I'm Im Cha Seong, the recently appointed President of Taejoo Construction.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.370
I look forward to working with everyone.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.990
I'm Choi Yong Geun, the new President of TJ's Distribution and Transportation Division.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.360
I lack many things,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.240
so I hope to receive a lot of advice from you all.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.300
[Chairwoman: Cheon Na Na]

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.560
I can't look at it.
[TJ Personnel Appointment]

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.980
You take a look at it.
[Choi Yong Geun: President of Distribution and Transportation Division]

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.700
Hurry up.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.450
Okay.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.350
- Detective Oh, there's a package for you.
- Thank you.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.510
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.670
No way!

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.510
I got one wrong again? Do you think that makes sense?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.420
Not only was one wrong, but the five numbers that Detective Oh gave you were wrong,

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.910
and only the number eighteen that Jae Hong suggested was right.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.880
Damn.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.940
Why? What did I do?

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.270
- What is that?
- It's a bulletproof vest.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.040
You only get it if you request it, so why did you?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.160
This is apparently used by the special units in the FBI. I ordered it online.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.890
Showing off your wealth again. Why did you suddenly buy that anyway?

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.560
Don't you remember what Team Leader Woo said?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.510
It wouldn't be weird if one of us got stabbed in the streets.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.640
I should be prepared.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.100
Then...

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.240
Hit me.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.360
- Hard.
- Even more?

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.890
Yeah.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.670
- Hey, try again with a knife.
- Harder.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.510
You'll do great.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.000
Don't be too nervous and do what you're supposed to.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.950
Yes, I will.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:32.060
We don't have to make deals in secrecy anymore now that you're a subsidiary president.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.540
I just need to increase your holdings at my discretion.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.610
Yes, thank you.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.430
I'm grateful for you, too. I came this far thanks to you.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:47.750
I'm even more thankful if you think that way.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.970
To tell you the truth, all I gave you was the title of president.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.320
Continue being my shadow, as you've done until now.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.330
Only then can I rest easy and keep this seat.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.370
Well, I understood it that way as well.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.050
Yes, you may leave now. See you around.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.520
Okay.

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.700
President Choi,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:23.200
being a detective is a very difficult job, isn't it?

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.580
You must know, since you worked as one.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.840
Detectives really put their lives on the line, right?

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.850
Yes. Well.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.910
Do you have any fellow detectives that died?

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.380
Yes.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.960
I guess that makes sense since it's a job that can earn a lot of grudges.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.440
There must be many people who want to kill a detective, right?

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.830
Now, you make the choice.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.050
Me, or Na Na?

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.960
By whom do you want to be killed?

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.960
This is Oh Ji Hyeok from the Incheon West Station.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.400
Yeah, it's me, Choi Yong Geun.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.780
I see.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.340
What can I do for you?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.030
I have something to give you.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.940
What is it?

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.290
An audio recording of Cheon Na Na.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.770
Everything you're curious about should be in it.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.200
Why so suddenly?

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.970
To live.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:01.700
This is the only way I can live.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.550
Okay, where should I meet you?

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.970
Do you remember where we caught that crazy bastard Park Ji Gwang

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.340
when we used to work together?

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.100
Yes. I do.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.680
This isn't the way to the station.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.540
Where are you taking me, Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.940
- Yeah?
- I looked into Park Ji Gwang.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.690
He was released not too long ago, and he's working at the junkyard where he used to work.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.900
Okay, thanks.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.870
You remember when we caught Park Ji Gwang, right?

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:40.320
He went all crazy, remember? And he said he'd kill me when he got out.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.020
You surprisingly remembered that.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.180
Kill me

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.900
and blame it on Park Ji Gwang as a vengeful murder.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:55.370
Why are you using something you learned from being a detective?

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.960
Assaulting a detective is a pretty serious crime.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.480
And the sentence will increase since you're on probation.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.720
Where's the audio recording of Cheon Na Na that you said you'd give me?

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.570
You don't have it, do you?

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.030
Then make it.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.820
With our past friendship in mind, I'll let this go.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.450
Door is being closed.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.260
What is it?

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.320
I tried to get Oh Ji Hyeok, but instead, I got beaten.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.700
I barely got out.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.810
They're probably already trying to find me by now.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.670
My face was exposed, you see?

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.400
Why are you telling me such things?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:38.070
I think I'll have to go into hiding for a while,

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:43.120
and I won't get caught since I know police investigation methods very well.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.630
But the problem is you.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.080
Since you'll find me one way or another,

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.840
I need a safety net for myself, too.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.530
Please tell me in your own words

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.820
that you were the one who killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:12.420
I'll take that as a promise that you won't find and kill me.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.500
I killed Jeong Hui Joo?

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.380
What are you talking about?

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.620
You

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.070
handed over

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:26.570
Jeong Hui Joo's body.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.700
I told you already.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.820
I didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:38.170
I didn't kill Jeong Hui Joo. I said I didn't kill her!

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.380
I'm exhausted. Seriously.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.800
So then... I guess there's nothing else I can do but confess.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:55.910
I'll go to prison, but that might be better.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.070
Since we'll both be in prison.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.660
There's no evidence anywhere that says I killed Jeong Hui Joo.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.200
No matter what you say, I won't be arrested.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.580
Do you want to see whose words work better in court?

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.470
Once my statement is added, motive for murder, the murder site,

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.640
your blood that was found on Jeong Hui Joo's clothing.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.460
I believe all of this will be explained.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.770
Why?

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.680
Why won't you believe me?

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.820
So,

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.470
I'm asking you to please make me believe you.

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:40.480
Not once did you tell me who killed her

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.210
or how they killed her.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.020
I told you that you can only trust the other person if you share something.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.330
It was an accident.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.070
She instigated it.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.070
I used to be a detective. It was no accident, even at a glance.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:24.730
Someone hit her from behind with a dull object.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.760
I killed her.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.140
Now the people who know that truth

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.750
are just you and me. Just the two of us.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.450
Is that enough?

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:51.360
We now have a relationship where we must trust each other.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.300
Yes, that's right.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.450
Okay.

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:08.680
It's a shame, but just once more... I'll trust you.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:14.590
If something strange happens to me by any chance,

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.670
I'll go to the police station right away.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.200
Now then.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.390
I'm going to kill them.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.790
I'm going to kill them.

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.530
Everyone that's strangling me,

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.760
I'm going to kill them all!

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.700
Kill them all!

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.330
Why?

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.330
What are you doing in the office this late?

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:22.540
Do you have a lot of work?

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.970
By the way, we should get a new phone for President Choi.

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.420
Na Na,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.400
just because you don't like something,

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.830
throwing, stepping on it, and killing it?

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.400
You can't do that.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.010
Okay?

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.160
Where?

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.190
Where is it?

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.460
Hey!

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.470
I'm going to kill you.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.120
So noisy.

Yes.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:10.760
The search and seizure warrant against TJ's headquarters has been issued.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:16.530
By the way, why are warrants being issued the moment we request them?

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:17.920
This makes things not very fun.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.880
I know, right?

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.600
We should be breaking things and just barging in.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.370
What if we don't get fired?

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:26.470
Stop talking nonsense and prepare for the search and seizure.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.960
You already notified them, right?

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.330
They won't make a fuss trying to block us now, would they?

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.180
No, they'll be waiting with their doors open.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.640
This is a search and seizure warrant.

Yes, of course.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.820
I killed her.

We now have a relationship where we must trust each other.

Choi Yong Geun, that bastard, was a detective, after all.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.490
He got everything out of her.

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:41.140
Send this data to the prosecutor, and as soon as we get the warrant, arrest her.

Good luck.
[From Cheon Sang Woo: Good luck]

- She already knows that the video is in our hands.
- The person you called can't answer the phone right now.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:59.100
What if she just left her cell phone at the cabin to avoid us tracking her?

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.370
That's not Cheon Na Na's style.

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:03.270
She's probably there instead of running away.

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:07.040
The place Cheon Na Na is at right now is where her mother died.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.180
It's also the place where she committed the murder.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.990
We should be prepared for the worst.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.080
What now? Should we force open it?

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.210
Is it certain that she's inside?

It wasn't me.

You're okay, right?

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.730
Are you confident that you can make me a culprit?

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.680
Yes. Definitely.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.620

It's not me.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.180
It is you.

01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:31.620
I'm right this time.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.610
Is he any better?

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.440
What's the use of solving a case?

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.090
What's the use of catching the real culprit...

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.150
when nothing changes?

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:14.010
Did you catch the real culprit?

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:15.720
What's the use of it anyway?

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.980
He won't understand anyway.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:21.890
I should've caught her sooner and told him.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.870
I feel so sorry toward him.

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.210
You're blaming yourself again.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:28.470
You caught the real culprit.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.680
Then you did all you could as a detective.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.950
I didn't catch the real culprit just because I'm a detective.

01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:38.720
I did it because it hurt.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.270
Whenever I thought of the dead Jeong Hui Joo,

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.340
it hurt so much.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:51.330
Whenever I think of Grandpa, who is in so much pain,

01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:54.440
it hurts me so much.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.070
I was in pain.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.780
That's why I ran around to catch the real culprit.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:10.720
Please tell Grandpa

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.000
that you caught the real culprit.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.620
It's no use.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.760
No, he'll hear you.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.320
He'll understand your sincerity.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.000
He'll know that you were in as much pain as he was.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.570
Grandpa,

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:44.860
we caught the person who killed

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.880
your granddaughter.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:50.830
It was Cheon Na Na.

You understand, right?

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.210
Now...

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:04.950
now you can stop suffering.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:07.060
I'm so sorry.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.440
Let's go, Ahjussi.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.050
Okay.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:13.420
You didn't have to take me home.

01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:19.030
Of course, I should.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.840
I thought about it,

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.160
and I think I'll be free around next week.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.070
So, how about having dinner then─

01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.830
Excuse me, just one moment, please.

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.380
Excuse me?

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:44.550
What are you doing on the street?

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.790
Stop, stop, stop.

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:48.990
Come here, come here!

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.450
You bastard!

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.130
You can't do this on the streets. Let's talk at the station.

01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:01.920
- Hey!
- Let go.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.120
♫ Come join me, it's a feast ♫

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.320
♫ I know you want to ♫

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.470
♫ I'll make this night just for you and me, oh oh oh ♫

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.910
♫ Come get me ♫

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:19.420

Chief + General Editor: joysprite, animarina_677

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:27.140
♫ I saw you, vanishing, out of my sight ♫

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.610
♫ Gazing eyes, shining lips ♫

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:30.090
Yeah?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.590
- What is it?
- Nam Gook!

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:37.680
Nam Gook!

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.800
Nam Gook!

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.710
Nam Gook!

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.410
Is Nam Gook the dog's name?

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.760
Yeah.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.360
Haven't we looked enough for him? Let's give up.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.980
No, we have to find it.

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.370
The owner stopped eating or drinking after losing his dog.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:55.730
Why do we have to look for a dog? We're detectives, so why?

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.780
The owner of the dog is the wife of the main agency's executive!

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:02.500
Our chief still didn't give up on being a superintendent.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.690
Nam Gook!

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.610
- Hey! We found him!
- We got him!

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.180
Woo hoo!

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.760
Is that Nam Gook?

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.840
Good job.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.120
Let's see, let's see.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.700
Let's see.

01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:25.290
You idiot, it's different.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:30.650
- This guy has a spot on his back, but this one doesn't.
- What?

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.970
If we dye the back, wouldn't it make them similar?

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:39.490
Stop talking nonsense! Don't manipulate evidence and go find the real one!

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:40.690
Where did this guy come from then?

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.320
And where's Man Goo?

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.810
Is he marking his territory somewhere again?

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.540
No, he said he smelled some deodeok (type of root)

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.030
and wanted to dig up some.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:53.560
Dong Wook!

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.140
What's he doing now? Is it another boar?

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.380
I don't see any boars.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.820
What is it?

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.180
What's wrong with his face?

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.620
I think it's really swollen.

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.890
What's he doing?

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.880
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.380
B-B...

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.350
Bees!
