00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.209
Hey.

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:09.589
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.479
You're under arrest for sexually assaulting a minor.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.278
[Episode 10]

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:21.312
All right.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:30.326
This CCTV footage shows you entering a hotel room with Jang Yoo Na.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:34.938
And this is a copy of the receipt that shows

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:37.296
you paid for the hotel room with your credit card.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.670

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.571
If you plead guilty,

00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:55.247
it can just end as sexual molestation.

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:56.854
But if you don't plead guilty,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.310
don't you think the victim will be upset?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.735
She said she was in shock and doesn't remember if it even went as far as rape.

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:07.735
But she might remember it all of a sudden.

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.675
Let me think about it.

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:17.768
Sure.

00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:20.135
Think about it carefully.

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:26.069
Think about whether you want to lose your badge and rest at home,

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.983
or if you want to wear a prison uniform and sleep uncomfortably in a cell.

00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:47.329
I know you work differently than other guys,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.949
but why did you have to do something that could cause misunderstandings?

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:52.075
Why did this happen?

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:54.019
You should know, you're the one who did it.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:55.404
Why now?

00:01:55.404 --> 00:01:59.606
The retrial is over, and their crimes have been covered up.

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:04.962
Are they trying to provoke me so I'll get angrier and dig deeper?

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:06.018
Why?

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:10.199
Shouldn't you worry about where you are right now?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.064
With that type of evidence,

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:14.456
you'll get convicted no matter what.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:17.307
Why did Team Leader Nam give me that option?

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:20.644
He said he would let me take off my badge and get some rest if I pleaded guilty.

00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:23.259
Isn't it obvious?

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.652
He wants you to hurry up and plead guilty.

00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:26.709
He was throwing bait.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.777
He wants me to quit.

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:30.683
Once I become a civilian,

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.605
Jong Tae...

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:35.687
is going to kill me.

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:52.540
[Tip: Violent crimes Lieutenant Oh suspected of sexually assaulting a minor]

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.228
Lieutenant Oh from violent crimes?

00:02:57.627 --> 00:02:59.427
Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.476
He locked up a minor in a hotel room.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:12.520
Who said he locked her up?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.390
He just paid for the room and let her stay there.

00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:17.559
So she was not locked up.

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.320
He sexually assaulted an 18-year-old in a hotel room, right?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.766
What is wrong with you?

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.892
I'm a reporter, and I'm just checking the facts.

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:25.774
The victim is Jang Yoo Na.

00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:28.951
The girl who first reported that Eun Hye was missing.

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:33.159
Detective Oh was just trying to use her to get information.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.858
So that's how they got to know each other naturally?

00:03:35.858 --> 00:03:38.743
Are you trying to use Jang Yoo Na to back Oh Ji Hyeok into a corner?

00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:43.798
It's obvious who she works for and who is behind all of this.

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:45.852
I'll let you meet him. You can ask him yourself.

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:46.956
That will clear up your suspicions.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:51.820
No, I might not be able to write the article objectively because of personal feelings.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.586
I'll see you later.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:55.857
Reporter Jin!

00:03:55.857 --> 00:04:01.147
You can't write the article now! If you write it now, it will be a false report!

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:02.687
Personal feelings?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.544
What is she talking about?

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:34.027
Did you look into it? Where's the victim?

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.896
Sunflower Center?

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:39.994
Okay. Thanks.

00:04:43.257 --> 00:04:46.910
He was always showing off. Serves him right.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.227
How the hell did he get twisted up in this? What an idiot.

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:55.144
Is the victim reliable?

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:56.312
Yes, sir.

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:57.796
It didn't seem like she was lying.

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.007
What about Oh Ji Hyeok? Did he admit to the charges?

00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.397
The evidence is so clear.

00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:05.316
He cannot not plead guilty.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.869
What the hell is going on nowadays─

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:13.159
You can go.

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.627
You take care of it.

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:17.280
Yes, sir.

00:05:18.787 --> 00:05:20.487
Team Leader Nam.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.338
Yes, sir?

00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:23.733
Are you─

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.618
Hello, I hope you've been well.

00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:52.719
It seems like you know why I'm here.

00:05:56.764 --> 00:05:58.264
Team Leader.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.760
Did you report it to the chief?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.479
Yeah.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.910
Shall I send the prosecutor a request for an arrest warrant?

00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:06.704
Hold off for now.

00:06:06.704 --> 00:06:07.610
What?

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.810
Let's just wait and see.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:23.283
I'll... come clean and admit it.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:26.490
But in exchange, could you give me some time to take care of a few things?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.866
I'm worried that my son in the army will be too shocked

00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:33.879
if his dad suddenly gets fired for corruption.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.755
I think it would be better if I go visit him and let him know what's happening.

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:41.644
Cut me some slack.

00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:44.904
You sure know how to make someone speechless.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:50.521
I went to check the location after I got the tip and found nothing.

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:52.305
Did you get rid of it because you knew?

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:55.540
Or was it just a warning?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.619
That you're in control and I should be careful?

00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:06.064
This is about something else, but I'm just curious,

00:07:06.064 --> 00:07:08.190
so let me ask you one thing.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.733
I heard you told the court that the missing murder weapon

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:17.762
from five years ago was found in your trunk.

00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:23.435
From what I remember, I'm the one who found the murder weapon.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.169
Shall we call it even and drop the issue for each other?

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:37.221
I'll take that as a yes and get going then.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.920
I heard your son who's in the army

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.961
was recently taken by the military police, and you got him out.

00:07:49.825 --> 00:07:51.552
Is that right?

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:16.945
[Chief Moon Sang Beom]

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:34.386
I talked to the chief.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:37.658
He wants to keep this quiet.

00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:40.491
Why don't you just resign?

00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.890
I'll talk to the victim and get her to drop the charges.

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:46.185
Thanks.

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:49.127
Let's wrap it up like that then.

00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:55.683
I was saying thanks for letting me confirm that my prediction was right.

00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.566
Jang... Jang Yoo Na?

00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:01.020
Please tell her this.

00:09:01.705 --> 00:09:04.678
Tell her to sue me for rape.

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:09.174
I think sleeping uncomfortably in a cell is better than dying.

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:17.130
Just lock him up as a rapist.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.406
And stay within the police until he's done serving his sentence.

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:26.700
After that, you can come work for my company and live a comfortable life.

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:33.931
He's a lot of work.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:39.930
Hey! Why would you say that to him?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.095
Sexual assault cases prioritize the victim's testimony these days.

00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:45.570
You'll get convicted, you idiot!

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.041
What's wrong with you?

00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.026
You're the only one I can depend on.

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:51.092
Hey. Hey!

00:09:51.092 --> 00:09:56.073
I'm busy with work right now. I'm stuck in the holding cell and can't do anything!

00:09:56.073 --> 00:09:57.781
How am I supposed to help you?

00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:01.817
Hyeongnim, you have a habit of underestimating yourself.

00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:04.549
You can do anything if you set your mind to it.

00:10:04.549 --> 00:10:06.211
Think about it carefully.

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.767
Hurry up and eat. The noodles will get cold.

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:10.924
Do you think I can swallow a noodle right now?

00:10:10.924 --> 00:10:14.878
Just try it. You'll need strength to save your partner.

00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:17.039
Why? Why do I have to save you?

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.455
You brought this upon yourself!

00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:23.263
Why do I have to deal with migraines because of you? Why?

00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:24.433
That's just your fate.

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:25.742
You crazy bastard.

00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:27.210
Hyeongnim.

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:31.658
I think you were right. It was Jo Seong Dae.

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:35.717
I met with Jang Yoo Na's friend, who said she heard he was looking for her.

00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:40.328
So, Jo Seong Dae is the one who set this up.

00:10:40.328 --> 00:10:41.278
What should I do?

00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:43.235
Should I go get him and kick his ass?

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:45.158
He won't talk just because you kick his ass.

00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:47.355
I'll do whatever it takes to make him talk.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.698
There's nothing to charge him with right now.

00:10:49.698 --> 00:10:53.635
We need to find the evidence that shows he killed Park Geon Ho first.

00:10:53.635 --> 00:10:55.844
Then I'll go get that evidence.

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.549
Neither you nor Detective Oh is in a position to go find it.

00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:01.739
We have to get him to get Detective Oh out.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:04.433
Just let me take care of him.

00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:07.861
Go get him then.

00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:09.299
Okay.

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:12.948
It's okay if he's half dead when I arrest him, right?

00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:14.500
Okay.

00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:19.393
That cop said all I needed to do was report it.

00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:25.136
But he said I have to stay at this stupid center. It's so annoying.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:28.569
I'll kill you if you cheat on me while I'm not there.

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:30.382
Sexual assault, my ass.

00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:33.171
He didn't touch me at all.

00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:35.229
Sure, he's good-looking,

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.939
but I wouldn't have just let him make a move on me.

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:40.002
I would've punched him right away.

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:43.702
Excuse me, do you know where the Sunflower Center is?

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:46.471
It's this one right here.

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:54.472
Hey, are you getting jealous?

00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:56.692
Hello.

00:11:56.692 --> 00:12:00.315
There's a victim who came here from the station due to a sexual assault case, right?

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:01.728
Miss Jang Yoo Na?

00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:03.033
Miss Jang Yoo Na?

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:04.557
Yes.

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.745
Miss Jang Yoo Na?

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:10.929
Yes?

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:14.680
Hello, I'm Jin Seo Kyeong from Jeonghan Daily News. I have a few questions─

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.104
No.

00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:19.392
Ahjumma, what's wrong with you? You said you would protect me.

00:12:19.392 --> 00:12:21.298
Why are you helping someone like her to meet me?

00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:23.560
- Wait!
- I said, no.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.574
Don't bother someone who's already going through a hard time.

00:12:25.574 --> 00:12:27.196
- Wait─
- I'm sorry.

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:30.383
We can't have reporters here.

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:32.710
I understand.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.415
Take care.

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:40.886
Detective Kang, Jang Yoo Na seems suspicious.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:43.577
I think she's hiding something.

00:12:44.737 --> 00:12:46.337
Yes?

00:12:54.658 --> 00:12:56.347
You know Jang Yoo Na, right?

00:12:56.347 --> 00:12:57.269
Yes.

00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:58.318
What is she like?

00:12:58.318 --> 00:13:00.096
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:02.596
I asked her to report me missing.

00:13:02.596 --> 00:13:05.945
I'm not saying I'm going to do something to her.

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:09.869
She sued Detective Oh for sexually assaulting her.

00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:10.928
Really?

00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:13.628
Detective Oh would never do that.

00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:18.053
She would do anything for money.

00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:20.263
Our friends never believe anything she says

00:13:20.263 --> 00:13:22.558
because she's usually lying.

00:13:22.558 --> 00:13:24.089
I see.

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:26.550
Then could you...

00:13:28.678 --> 00:13:32.258
Your chief is here.

00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:34.582
Is something wrong?

00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:36.105
Here you go.

00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:38.596
You didn't need to buy this kind of thing for us.

00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:42.507
Detective Kang speaks badly of me these days, right?

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:47.413
A chief can't take care of each and every person,

00:13:47.413 --> 00:13:51.155
but I really like Detective Kang.

00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:52.264
I mean that.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:53.937
Okay.

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:55.168
Would you like a cup of coffee─

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.338
No.

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.236
He doesn't drink instant coffee.

00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:01.181
Give us the room so we can talk.

00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:03.825
Okay, you two can talk then.

00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:05.746
Okay.

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:12.037
What brings you all the way here?

00:14:14.796 --> 00:14:16.417
The pictures you showed me yesterday.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:20.920
Did you take those or did someone else take them and send them to you?

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.353
Someone else took them.

00:14:23.353 --> 00:14:27.437
Hey, you should try harder if you want to take me down.

00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:28.695
It's too bad.

00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:32.858
Yoon Sang Mi wasn't able to find the actual evidence.

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:45.791
You got scammed.

00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:47.881
That's a fake.

00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:01.839
What is it that you want from me?

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.748
Admit it.

00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:07.006
Admit that you were wrong back then and you're wrong now.

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:08.930
So...

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.473
you think it's my fault that Lee Dae Cheol is dead?

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:13.976
It's not just your fault.

00:15:13.976 --> 00:15:18.421
It's because of all the people who hid the truth to save themselves.

00:15:18.421 --> 00:15:19.582
And you're one of them.

00:15:19.582 --> 00:15:24.404
Doing this won't make Lee Dae Cheol come back to life.

00:15:25.626 --> 00:15:28.103
He may be dead,

00:15:28.103 --> 00:15:30.891
but we still need to comfort his soul.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.150
Fine, I'm sorry.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.009
What do you want me to do?

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:48.449
Should I go and kneel in front of his grave?

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:51.181
Of course, you need to beg on your knees.

00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:54.303
Eun Hye, come out here! Eun Hye!

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.382
I'm...

00:16:26.214 --> 00:16:28.274
sorry.

00:16:29.318 --> 00:16:32.162
What are you sorry about?

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:34.444
Tell her.

00:16:34.444 --> 00:16:36.801
Tell her what you're sorry about.

00:16:39.014 --> 00:16:44.360
I didn't conduct a proper investigation

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.030
because I got greedy.

00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:50.262
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:55.946
I want to sincerely apologize

00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:01.011
to your late father.

00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:02.511
Why?

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:06.785
Why did you do it?

00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:09.242
Why?

00:17:09.242 --> 00:17:13.231
I was a fool.

00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:16.303
I was only thinking about my future.

00:17:16.993 --> 00:17:19.093
I'm sorry.

00:17:19.093 --> 00:17:23.708
For you and your father.

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.310
This is a list of the items I confiscated.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.319
Write the names of the people who gave these to you.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:18:00.918
I'll return these to them myself.

00:18:04.157 --> 00:18:06.436
This was humiliating,

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:10.645
but I feel better.

00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:15.124
Thank you, Kang Do Chang.

00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:37.268
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:42.013
I wasn't able to do anything for you.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.890
I'm sorry.

00:19:11.787 --> 00:19:15.231
The other places have dust on them, but this was wiped clean.

00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:18.688
And that one over there and that one too.

00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:22.453
That means someone came to wipe down the prints.

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:26.216
They put in a lot of effort to get rid of Jo Seong Dae's prints.

00:19:26.216 --> 00:19:29.969
Man Goo, did you find any traces of blood?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.543
It's the same over here.

00:19:32.543 --> 00:19:35.000
There are only traces that someone cleaned up.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.266
Look carefully. There must be something we missed.

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:41.909
These days, we can get everything from just one drop of blood.

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:45.303
Team Leader Nam wouldn't have left anything if he was the one who cleaned up.

00:19:45.303 --> 00:19:48.799
He's been looking at crime scenes for more than ten years.

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.499
Hyeongnim!

00:19:56.413 --> 00:20:00.305
I think some traces of blood got on the wall after he pushed Park Geon Ho off.

00:20:00.305 --> 00:20:04.565
Aigoo, I guess Team Leader Nam failed to get this one.

00:20:16.973 --> 00:20:20.851
I got you, Jo Seong Dae.

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:26.896
I got a call from Kim Gi Tae earlier.

00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:30.302
He wants to see me.

00:20:30.302 --> 00:20:32.283
Did you tell him that you were working with me?

00:20:32.283 --> 00:20:33.434
No.

00:20:33.434 --> 00:20:35.707
Then why would he want to see me?

00:20:35.707 --> 00:20:39.188
Maybe he caught on to what we've been doing.

00:20:39.188 --> 00:20:40.998
It doesn't matter.

00:20:40.998 --> 00:20:44.535
I don't work for him.

00:20:48.045 --> 00:20:50.579
Did Hong Doo ask you to do this too?

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:52.357
I don't talk to him anymore.

00:20:52.357 --> 00:20:54.130
I don't meet with him.

00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:57.576
Did that detective call you?

00:20:57.576 --> 00:20:59.157
You got paid, huh?

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:00.107
What do you mean?

00:21:00.107 --> 00:21:05.007
I know that cop. You're not his type.

00:21:06.183 --> 00:21:07.642
Look at this bitch.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:10.388
You got paid to put him in prison, huh?

00:21:10.388 --> 00:21:12.590
Are you out of your mind?

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.904
Who paid you?

00:21:13.904 --> 00:21:15.642
I want to know.

00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:18.556
I need money too.

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:20.285
By any chance, are you...

00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:23.472
- What are you doing?
- Give me your phone.

00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:26.997
Unlock it before I beat you up.

00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:32.497
Happy?

00:21:35.699 --> 00:21:38.018
You're really not here to help the cop, right?

00:21:38.018 --> 00:21:40.737
You know how much I hate cops.

00:21:40.737 --> 00:21:44.950
I hate that bastard even more. He harassed me so much.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.910
Let me get some money from the guy who paid you.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.249
He's out of your league.

00:21:53.702 --> 00:21:56.668
Does Hong Doo Oppa know that you have a side project?

00:21:57.338 --> 00:22:02.825
You think he'll leave you alone if I tell him that you took the money for yourself?

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:06.680
Give me the details on what you did.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.728
I'll split the money with you if I get paid.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.591
Hey, don't tell them that I told you about it, okay?

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:23.226
Okay?

00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:27.032
Don't worry, I won't need to talk to them myself.

00:22:36.407 --> 00:22:39.888
Hey, did the cop really sexually assault you?

00:22:39.888 --> 00:22:43.996
They wouldn't have paid me if he had.

00:22:48.363 --> 00:22:51.706
You bitch!

00:22:51.706 --> 00:22:54.881
Do you know who I despise the most in this world?

00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:59.472
Those who frame innocent people just to save themselves.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:02.225
Got it? You bitch.

00:23:15.567 --> 00:23:18.376
Jang Yoo Na dropped the charges.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.898
Did she say who made her do it?

00:23:20.898 --> 00:23:23.098
As you expected.

00:23:40.844 --> 00:23:44.145
Don't try so hard to take my badge away from me.

00:23:44.145 --> 00:23:47.578
I'm going to chase you down even without my badge.

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:52.425
Are you doing this because it's me?

00:23:53.051 --> 00:23:58.718
I don't think you would be so obsessed with it if the suspect were someone else.

00:23:58.718 --> 00:24:00.691
Don't kid yourself.

00:24:01.379 --> 00:24:03.369
I'm chasing after a killer, not you.

00:24:03.369 --> 00:24:05.536
Oh, because you're a detective.

00:24:06.407 --> 00:24:09.611
Did you catch that killer?

00:24:09.611 --> 00:24:12.423
The one who killed your father.

00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:16.484
How come someone who's so obsessed with catching killers

00:24:16.484 --> 00:24:20.273
can't catch the one who killed his own father?

00:24:20.273 --> 00:24:24.054
You saw him with your own two eyes.

00:24:25.385 --> 00:24:27.418
You need to get him.

00:24:27.927 --> 00:24:32.143
That will avenge your mother's suicide too.

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:36.029
She died because of you.

00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:39.864
Because you couldn't remember the killer's face.

00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:45.150
You should catch that guy first instead of taking your anger out on someone else.

00:24:46.672 --> 00:24:49.567
You're right. I am taking my anger out on you.

00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:53.165
I want to catch everyone because I'm frustrated that I can't catch that guy.

00:24:53.165 --> 00:24:57.706
I'm going to arrest every single shameless criminal who acts like they did nothing wrong.

00:24:57.706 --> 00:25:00.411
Okay, try it.

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.259
If you can.

00:25:05.316 --> 00:25:12.171
Do you know why Uncle thought more highly of me than his own son?

00:25:15.366 --> 00:25:19.566
You think your background counts as your skills.

00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:24.011
You would be nothing without that background.

00:25:27.122 --> 00:25:30.122
Kill me yourself if you want me dead.

00:25:30.122 --> 00:25:34.310
Don't pay someone to do it with the money that Uncle gave you.

00:26:08.957 --> 00:26:11.855
She died because of you.

00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:15.138
Because you couldn't remember the killer's face.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.756
Mom?

[Trustworthy police, happy citizens]

00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:54.780
What did the chief say?

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.447
He wants me to come back to work starting today.

00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:04.391
What about Oh Ji Hyeok?

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.602
He should be released since he didn't do anything wrong.

00:28:06.602 --> 00:28:12.430
We just need to get the bastard who framed him.

00:28:13.445 --> 00:28:16.137
Yes, of course.

00:28:16.137 --> 00:28:20.401
He messed with our amazing Team Leader Nam.

00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:31.186
Yes, Chief.

00:28:31.186 --> 00:28:33.419
There's a detective involved.

00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:37.361
Things will go faster if you call that detective.

00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:43.487
I'm not going to find you responsible for this.

00:28:43.487 --> 00:28:48.079
There are a lot of victims who try to take advantage of detectives these days.

00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:51.915
But as you heard,

00:28:51.915 --> 00:28:58.094
what pisses me off is that a detective tried to mess with another detective.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:11.230
I want you to find out which detective is involved in this.

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:33.079
Reporter Jin.

00:29:35.349 --> 00:29:36.960
What are you doing here?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.260
I'm not here to see you today,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.700
I'm here to see your senior manager.

00:29:50.057 --> 00:29:52.057
Hi Detective Oh.

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:54.516
I was in the area for a meeting,

00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:58.654
but it got canceled, so I came to see you instead.

00:29:58.654 --> 00:30:01.040
- Have you eaten?
- No, not yet.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.408
But we have a company dinner today.

00:30:03.408 --> 00:30:06.208
I wanted to grab drinks with you since it has been a long time.

00:30:06.208 --> 00:30:07.384
I guess another time then.

00:30:07.384 --> 00:30:09.034
Congrats on your verdict.

00:30:09.034 --> 00:30:10.600
No need to congratulate me.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.412
It would've been better to get the verdict during my second trial.

00:30:13.412 --> 00:30:15.740
It's only making the prosecutor work harder.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.444
I'm sure it will go well if you lie low.

00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:26.878
You know Oh Jong Tae, right?

00:30:26.878 --> 00:30:29.345
The guy who was at the hearing.

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:33.179
- I know him.
- Do you know

00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:37.180
that I was head of the department during Lee Dae Cheol's case?

00:30:37.866 --> 00:30:42.855
The case is interesting because there are a lot of things hidden behind it.

00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:47.361
If Oh Jong Tae is bothering you,

00:30:47.361 --> 00:30:50.989
I have something that can help you.

00:30:50.989 --> 00:30:52.849
No need to overthink it.

00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:56.345
I was just doing what I could to save myself.

00:31:01.456 --> 00:31:03.656
What brings you all the way here?

00:31:04.218 --> 00:31:07.830
I was wondering if you did your homework while I was away.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.287
What homework?

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:14.256
Figuring out what the audio file was about.

00:31:14.256 --> 00:31:19.314
I'm sorry. I was too busy trying to help an idiot out.

00:31:19.314 --> 00:31:21.297
You got distracted by personal matters.

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:23.081
It wasn't a personal matter.

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:26.772
I had to do it in order to check the facts.

00:31:26.772 --> 00:31:28.786
So you just did your job as a reporter?

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:30.765
I would've done much more if I wasn't a reporter.

00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:33.535
I would've yelled at you, so you wouldn't do anything that stupid again.

00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:36.869
I'm able to let it go because I have no personal feelings about it.

00:31:36.869 --> 00:31:38.717
I'm a little sad as a reporter.

00:31:38.717 --> 00:31:41.717
It would've been a huge hit if it were true.

00:31:43.732 --> 00:31:44.895
Are you free tonight?

00:31:44.895 --> 00:31:46.566
No, I've got to do my homework.

00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:49.227
These days, I can't sleep again.

00:31:49.227 --> 00:31:52.830
I think I'll be able to sleep really well if I drink again like last time.

00:31:53.888 --> 00:31:55.436
Detective Oh.

00:31:55.436 --> 00:31:59.217
Reporters only drink if there's a story.

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:03.031
A stupid detective getting into an ambulance after a drink?

00:32:03.031 --> 00:32:05.026
It's not a good story.

00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:11.295
Hello?

00:32:11.295 --> 00:32:12.337
Oh, yeah.

00:32:12.337 --> 00:32:14.068
We have a company dinner.

00:32:14.068 --> 00:32:16.226
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:24.304
That's good. I was craving drinks today. I'm going to go drink all I want.

00:32:24.304 --> 00:32:26.356
See you later.

00:32:26.356 --> 00:32:30.787
I'll remember to come with a story next time.

00:32:32.725 --> 00:32:34.525
Thank you.

00:32:38.616 --> 00:32:40.650
Do you really mean─

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.550
Call me when you finish your homework. It's really important.

00:32:50.432 --> 00:32:52.453
Cheers!

00:32:59.036 --> 00:33:02.131
I think Incheon's stories are a little weak these days.

00:33:02.131 --> 00:33:03.394
I don't work in Incheon.

00:33:03.394 --> 00:33:05.723
Oh, right!

00:33:05.723 --> 00:33:07.398
You work at the headquarters.

00:33:07.398 --> 00:33:09.122
Sorry.

00:33:10.347 --> 00:33:14.284
Senior Manager, the economy section wants us to take care of a complaint they got about an ad.

00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:15.666
Does that make any sense?

00:33:15.666 --> 00:33:17.205
Should we go fight them?

00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:18.269
Just write one for them.

00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:22.605
I don't have much power. The economy editor brings in more money.

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:26.929
I don't know why the people at the company talk crap about me all the time.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.878
How's the project going? Is it going well?

00:33:30.878 --> 00:33:34.370
Yes. Song Gwang Hui and I are going to write the article.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.997
Will the two of you be enough? It will be a series.

00:33:36.997 --> 00:33:39.927
Then we'll have Jin Seo Kyeong join us.

00:33:39.927 --> 00:33:43.776
She wrote the article about the death row inmates' victims,

00:33:43.776 --> 00:33:46.042
and she was in charge of Lee Dae Cheol's retrial too.

00:33:46.042 --> 00:33:48.266
She'll be helpful.

00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:51.876
"Was the execution the right thing to do?"

00:33:51.876 --> 00:33:53.505
That's what the series is about.

00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:58.385
We're going to take another look at the justification for the execution.

00:33:58.385 --> 00:34:01.780
Was the execution the right thing to do?

00:34:05.141 --> 00:34:08.008
Did your brother ask you to do it this time too?

00:34:08.008 --> 00:34:11.987
Are you trying to use your hoobaes (juniors) to help your brother out again?

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.293
I know we're at a dinner, but you still shouldn't say things without any grounds.

00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:19.412
Without any grounds?

00:34:19.412 --> 00:34:21.643
Then let me ask you this.

00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:24.947
Why did you ask me to interview the victims' families?

00:34:24.947 --> 00:34:28.275
Weren't you trying to get the public on board with carrying out an execution

00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:31.687
before your brother was appointed Minister to get rid of any political burdens?

00:34:31.687 --> 00:34:35.560
And after all of that, we're now talking about whether the execution was the right thing to do?

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.794
On what grounds did you plan the series?

00:34:39.794 --> 00:34:42.301
You're trying to make it fit with the president's promise

00:34:42.301 --> 00:34:44.955
to abolish the death sentence.

00:34:44.955 --> 00:34:48.301
You and your brother planned all of this!

00:34:48.301 --> 00:34:50.083
I...

00:34:51.299 --> 00:34:55.772
I'm no longer going to play the selfish game that the two brothers have set up.

00:34:55.772 --> 00:34:59.902
I didn't come to the headquarters to be your puppet.

00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:06.946
Go stop her.

00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:08.138
Seonbae (senior)!

00:35:08.138 --> 00:35:09.050
Jin seonbae!

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.974
Let her go.

00:35:10.974 --> 00:35:12.617
You've all had enough drinks, right?

00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:14.996
Let's finish our last drink and wrap it up here.

00:35:29.551 --> 00:35:30.917
It's cold.

00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:33.410
You'll catch a cold if you have cold drinks outside.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.427
Do you feel better now that you got all that out?

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:40.226
No, not yet.

00:35:40.226 --> 00:35:42.505
What? What more do you need to say?

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:45.258
The audio file was on the USB that Song Gwang Hui

00:35:45.258 --> 00:35:48.209
took out of the trash at the police agency, wasn't it?

00:35:48.902 --> 00:35:51.070
You already knew about it, right?

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.796
And you acted like you were hearing it for the first time when I brought it to you.

00:35:54.796 --> 00:35:58.276
You used it to make the execution happen.

00:35:58.276 --> 00:36:02.042
And you didn't let me write about the file to hide that.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.249
Let's expose the audio file at the end of the series.

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:09.233
Why now?

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:12.152
I didn't expose the file earlier because I thought it would

00:36:12.152 --> 00:36:15.147
provoke the police and the prosecution and make things worse.

00:36:15.147 --> 00:36:16.837
I thought you would get hurt too.

00:36:16.837 --> 00:36:18.427
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:20.924
Articles are all about the timing,

00:36:20.924 --> 00:36:23.402
and this is the time.

00:36:30.362 --> 00:36:32.945
When you came to me to ask me to write about your father,

00:36:32.945 --> 00:36:36.070
you were crying as you handed me a can of coffee.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.470
I wrote the article because of that can of coffee.

00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:43.953
But that's not the only reason.

00:36:43.953 --> 00:36:48.623
The bigger reason was that I am a reporter.

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:57.022
The staff is waiting for round two. I'm leaving.

00:37:01.873 --> 00:37:05.131
You've grown a lot. You know how to go against the senior manager now.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.950
[Incheon West Police Station]

00:37:22.181 --> 00:37:24.896
He got rid of anything that could be used as evidence,

00:37:24.896 --> 00:37:28.272
but he forgot about this.

00:37:28.272 --> 00:37:31.962
Aigoo, I guess Team Leader Nam failed to get this one.

00:37:33.142 --> 00:37:34.766
When will we get the lab results?

00:37:34.766 --> 00:37:37.647
I asked them to hurry. So we should get them by tomorrow.

00:37:37.647 --> 00:37:39.070
We can start with this then.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.168
Wouldn't it have been hard to get rid of the evidence by himself?

00:37:42.168 --> 00:37:45.183
I'm sure someone helped him.

00:37:45.183 --> 00:37:47.169
- Who took this picture?
- It was me.

00:37:47.169 --> 00:37:50.077
- Without any equipment?
- I just took it with my hands.

00:37:50.077 --> 00:37:51.923
- I'm the one who found it.
- You?

00:37:51.923 --> 00:37:53.800
I almost died.

00:37:56.385 --> 00:37:57.985
Hey.

00:37:57.985 --> 00:38:00.799
Why are you reopening a case that we closed?

00:38:00.799 --> 00:38:03.089
You said you admit it.

00:38:03.089 --> 00:38:08.529
Don't you remember getting on your knees and apologizing?

00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:14.652
Now it's used against me.

00:38:16.746 --> 00:38:19.167
Even if we arrest Jo Seong Dae for killing Park Geon Ho,

00:38:19.167 --> 00:38:24.911
we'll only be able to get Oh Jong Tae for conspiring to commit murder.

00:38:24.911 --> 00:38:27.335
You have to keep that in mind.

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:32.471
Eun Hye told me it's unfair.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:39.469
She doesn't know why her dad had to die while the real killer roams freely.

00:38:42.405 --> 00:38:44.526
Why are you taking me to the interrogation room?

00:38:44.526 --> 00:38:47.392
I just have to ask you something in private.

00:38:47.392 --> 00:38:49.465
But it feels weird. Just ask me here.

00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:52.393
I'll tell you in the room!

00:39:03.213 --> 00:39:04.314
What?

00:39:04.314 --> 00:39:05.802
Why the hell would I do that?

00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:08.759
Why would a detective destroy the crime scene? And a murder scene at that.

00:39:08.759 --> 00:39:11.824
You would go kill yourself if Team Leader Nam ordered you to do it.

00:39:11.824 --> 00:39:15.387
What did you just say? Do you have a death wish?

00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:18.483
Kwon Jae Hong, be quiet.

00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:20.102
Detective Choi, have a seat.

00:39:20.102 --> 00:39:22.081
I can't stay here any longer.

00:39:22.081 --> 00:39:24.582
- Move.
- Sit down!

00:39:24.582 --> 00:39:26.227
It will be better for you to stay seated.

00:39:26.227 --> 00:39:29.160
- There's no need for us to investigate each other.
- What?

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:35.841
Should we investigate another detective and expose some stuff like your team leader did?

00:39:35.841 --> 00:39:38.593
I'm trying to hear your side of the story.

00:39:38.593 --> 00:39:43.897
So sit down and just answer my questions truthfully.

00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:45.371
Sit.

00:39:49.171 --> 00:39:52.319
Do you also believe that Park Geon Ho's murder was

00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:55.960
closed as a suicide because of an investigation that was done well?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.822
We checked all the CCTV footage around the area and

00:39:57.822 --> 00:40:00.811
confirmed that Park Geon Ho drove there by himself.

We submitted all of the evidence we collected at the scene to the lab.

What more could we have done?

00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:11.194
The lab said you guys didn't submit any DNA or blood evidence.

00:40:11.194 --> 00:40:15.373
The pictures show that Park Geon Ho had a stab wound on his thigh.

00:40:15.373 --> 00:40:18.637
Then shouldn't there be Park Geon Ho's blood on the scene?

You're the one who submitted the evidence to the lab, right?

If you let this opportunity go,

When I went to the forensics team,

00:43:23.716 --> 00:43:25.712
they were missing the cigarette butt and

a rock with blood on it that we found at the scene.

The reporter is here with us at the studio.

00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:33.032
Reporter Jeong, isn't this case about Park Geon Ho committing suicide after making

00:44:33.032 --> 00:44:36.314
a false confession about killing death row inmate Lee Dae Cheol's daughter?

00:44:36.314 --> 00:44:37.277
Yes, that's correct.

00:44:37.277 --> 00:44:40.915
It was already closed by Incheon's West Police Department as a suicide.

Why are you requesting we interview you?

I've been an officer for 15 years.

My conscience wouldn't let me do it.

00:45:01.924 --> 00:45:04.690
Park Geon Ho's case was not properly investigated in the beginning.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.294
It shouldn't have been closed as a suicide.

It only put you in a difficult position.

You two believe that my husband and Detective Nam

framed Lee Dae Cheol, right?

00:46:51.189 --> 00:46:56.810
To be honest, I wanted to say at the trial

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.635
that my husband would never do that.

00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:02.481
Your husband will still be considered to have died in the line of duty.

No, it's not all over.

Since my husband died, I've only been thinking about my daughter and myself.

00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:16.620
I didn't think about the one who died.

00:47:17.343 --> 00:47:22.410
My husband wouldn't have made a deal with a killer.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.590
At least that's what I wanted to say.

For that person,

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:31.660
I think that's the least I can do.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:37.104
He never even gave me enough money for our living expenses.

00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:40.317
I had to get a job to send my daughter to tutoring too.

00:47:40.317 --> 00:47:43.209
So there's no way he got paid off.

00:47:44.044 --> 00:47:47.287
He only cared about doing his job.

00:47:47.287 --> 00:47:52.485

You said you're sure he's the killer.

No, I think I was wrong about that.

So Nam Gook Hyeon is the only one who made a deal with the killer.

If Detective Jang had found out about Nam Gook Hyeon messing with the case,

00:48:59.029 --> 00:49:05.227
isn't there a possibility that Nam Gook Hyeon killed him instead of Oh Jong Tae?

00:49:05.227 --> 00:49:10.004
A detective killed his partner who's closer to him than a brother?

00:49:10.004 --> 00:49:13.579
Would you be able to kill me just for money?

I just made the first move.

00:49:27.056 --> 00:49:29.963
I think you made things worse.

00:49:29.963 --> 00:49:32.464
I wasn't trying to get back at the police.

00:49:32.464 --> 00:49:34.829
It was meant for you.

I have the evidence that I hid for Park Geon Ho's case.

00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:43.871
It will be enough to reveal immediately that Jo Seong Dae is the killer.

00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:47.429
And they'll soon find out that you were behind everything.

00:49:47.429 --> 00:49:50.235
It will be hard for you to dodge it this time.

00:49:50.235 --> 00:49:53.163
You could've discussed it with me first.

Then what do you want me to do?

Let me sum up into three parts what you have to do.

Number one.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.618
You'll leave me alone and let me live quietly.

Two.

You'll take care of things, so the reinvestigation doesn't go well.

That's right.

This is embarrassing to say, but since I run a business, I go to get my fortune read.

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:02.017
I got my fortune read at the beginning of the year,

00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:04.880
and I heard I will go through a lot of distress this year.

That's not good.

But it wasn't all bad.

I also heard that someone will come to take care of all the distress.
